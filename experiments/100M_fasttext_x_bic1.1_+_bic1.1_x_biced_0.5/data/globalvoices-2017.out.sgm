<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My dear to America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, I danced to American music, read American writers and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the age of 14, I saw the great Denzel Washington, how he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, revealed the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "according to Method Man," "" "" "" "I was like it was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump arrived.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as you say so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague expressing it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican primaries was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the JournalismusculProgram, which records people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Trump Weltanschauung did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at play.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trump Intolerance also contrasts with the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought for the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot during my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump arrived on his way to the nominee Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly White, gave the presidency to a man despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The discussion with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "to categorize people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful, indicating an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look differently from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Annex D.: as much as "rebellion of the white against all other ethnic groups"; white and Whiplash's word game in reference to the whites and whiplash which meant so much like trauma), as the big Van Jones called it has killed just that which America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may always have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he himself says, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the election of Donald Trump, a huge part of the White America promises this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of word with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" "" "" "" "Mr. Khan asked." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "" "" "No!" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "no!" "" "" "" "the crowd was roaring." "</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "no!" "" "" "" "they cried, and their voices became louder." "" "</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "would anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "" "" "NO" "" "" "" "!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "this is Trump Land now," "" "" "" "said the message." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could no longer find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played at both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the garbage</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, just 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, La banda de Música (music band) has played in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults who has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become central to the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote on this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare smile.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they get out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You are always smiling and playing with shiny eyes and playing in the hustle and bustle you will learn day after day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music out of rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village that is located at the top of the biggest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguays's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments made from local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chávez have begun to transform pieces of decay into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, viola, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all of which were produced from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire encompasses classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article published by the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the initial period:</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage. the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a trash produced from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is an entire orchestra playing instruments from recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic Waste Ship) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world generates about one billion tons of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and him are the poorest - as the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can combat illegal fishing successfully</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that targets international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release takes place as part of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were therefore upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal offender of this type on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles rapidly mobilized against the ship. they refused to buy one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing license.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that simply refused to" "" "" "", "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay $2 million in Liberia, because of the looting of the fish stocks in the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative to cross criminal practices and protect resources was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded by NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries) in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that then expelled the prime minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"we have eight countries that are like-minded people and work together. they exchange information and stand up for illegal fishing," says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to track down. this makes illegal fishing a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By intentionally ignoring existing laws through which certain habitats and habitats should be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once impeded by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the snail empo, with information between individual countries curtailed, the actions now happen in real time, with traceability at FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">The individual countries can, for example, exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea, via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships fishing in forbidden areas. such suspicious lanes can also be discovered, such as those who suggest that a ship loads its captured fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were on the move and possibly also whether they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information. which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated $20 million lost in lost revenue, which lost eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of illegal fishermen entering east African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercially fishers from all over the world. among them illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include activities such as coasting under false flag, bogus license papers, fancy names, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-gap-organized control system," "" "" "" "said Long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and exactly this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front has been working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its co-operation with INTERPOL, the international body to combat crime, FISH-i can divide and receive information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "" "" "says Bergh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps detecting the illegal ships that are happy to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and we try to cross it," says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and provides technical support for FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, for example, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">The aim of Copeland is to build a system that combines different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminals with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">SkyTruth has recently opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Marine Protection Agency: a platform that provides satellite data and displays the position of each individual trackable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "come together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what's right," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and consolidate their resources for investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "" "" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "" "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the pursuit of ships." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only detecting criminals but also deterring them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which formerly fished without a license and had hardly had any consequences, know now that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have meanwhile recorded a 33% increase in fishing turnover since fishing boats purchase more licences.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "" "" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "" "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "" "" "says Kiilu." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="148">There six countries have joined together in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to the exact same model as FISH-i. "" With safety, the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions, "says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia had its first big triumph: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship that was travelling under false flag. and not only was the ship on the way without a license and were used trawl nets, which are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters which were reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they used a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing," said Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the world ocean.

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela had rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on impeachment, the Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emptiness, reacted by gathering on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the refund of Venezuela), both images of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among other things in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andes regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central-north federal state of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country continues to deteriorate continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>

<seg id="177">Particularly large waves struck the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed advocates of the government according to their own testimony.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview given by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was audited on 23 August 2016 in Día a Día, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take a look at the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in Córdoba's Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="200">As now grown up, Quijano has now testified in the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Cordoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial concluded on 24 August 2016 for crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations at La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept family secrets.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not realize that one is being manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, torturer and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was the deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 in La Perla prison until 1978.</seg>

<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who over the years recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving license, were witnesses to a very successful translation last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a shield, the Japanese word, the "older motorists" means, falsely - perhaps also with malicious thought and # 8212; as "awful motorists."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from September 1st to September 20th.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Levine, widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the fact that the local newspapers drew attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="352">The paper Kyoto Shimbun, which appears in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation corrected.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "" "" "this is an insult for older people and in an international city as Kyoto simply unacceptable," "" "" "" "said Holmes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The incorrect English translation was first removed. the term "terrible drivers" (German: "awful motorists") was later replaced by the more appropriate, though grammatically correct name "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported the apologies as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are sincerely sorry that older people felt offended by the insufficient correction (translation) on our part," said the police. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast news was a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the "awful" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "awful" has been denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved nationwide in accidents is a cause of concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, in 2005, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 cases of seniors were caused. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors generated 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has fallen, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has risen in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">In the version of the article published on Yahoo, the non-named journalist brought comments to light, which show which prejudices some Japanese apparently have against older drivers:</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and to use active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">A French native speaker should, for example, translate from English into French - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost-searching, or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have a foreign staff, can still produce translations in-house. then, the Japanese colleague, whose English knowledge is assessed as the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confusing and enigmatic propositions created by machine translations show that this technology cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious prints that often decorate shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but from large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards, more careful translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the Kyoto City will hopefully use a more reputable source for its translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the website Navegar con Libertad (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet sites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters carried out recordings of the protests in Caracas, which were organised by opposition groups opposing the government Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and the Parliament's duties on the executive and the Supreme Court itself had committed itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was coupled and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zenit: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages are again blocked by Venezuelan providers.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offerings such as Vivoplay are popular among Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in periods of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunication threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw it as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I signed up at @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsymphintro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible through a locking of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online transmitters.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, revealed that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique through which the DNS server will answer requests for certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">When an Internet site is blocked by the DNS, the server responds poorly or denies the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS block: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the broadcast was shut down on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released and VPITV went back to the show.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates the internet connections: this makes the Venezuelans more difficult to access multimedia reporting about current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that children have to spend countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be done - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice, called Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>

<seg id="455">The Criadita are not only exploited as labour forces; they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to bankrupt and her father lost his job.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to go to work and began to sell candy on the streets or on the market in order to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up at five o'clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays, for example, cleansed the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner it was finished with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but she didn't have any food indefinitely. "I was allowed to pick up more books from the house library as food out of the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party that belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 until 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">At some evenings the owner Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and to read an editorial in opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">In doing so, he tried to convince them not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"the master had found someone who listened while talking about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they didn't allow me to visit my family because they thought I would" learn "bad habits there again." they said that Alvarenga, which belongs to the indigenous group of Guarani, would again speak to Guarani's native language at home.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made available to her, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">She was, however, fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also at school, Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing that almost never is spoken is mobbing and harassment exposed to Criadilla when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to come home. I had no friends in the school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time when friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I didn't belong to any group.</seg>

<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it may result in a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs and cures in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, video alignment and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration. it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they control physically public and private spaces it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">When I take them seriously, it means that they will establish a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to feed them into a court process.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north-east of Iraq, the animal rescue worker Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists of the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persican leopard.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of leopards, which fight through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus Saxicolor).</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows in the video, "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem will also depend on a large predator.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video concludes that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a biologist, Raza is fond of a different side of her country, which is not just war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programmes by Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>

<seg id="544">Early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for northeastern Japan, documented the progress that has been achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, tsunami and an nuclear accident in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was a State Prefecture in Japan, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring villages Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, as the tsunami had let entire coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, Fukushima Prefecture has seen an atomic accident, alone that's why 160,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view which progress six years after was reached to rebuild the lives of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese reconstruction and survey results of the sufferers themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (to be found in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate) were completed by December 2015.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi recorded the greatest success among the three prefectures, and 80 per cent of the planned substitutions were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima with 70 percent represents the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the disaster, evacuation of shelter dwellings (to be found in the in-chief, Kazetsu juutaku) must be relocated to final shelters.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple disaster, nearly 80,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful on this occasion.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools that were affected by disaster have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of schools in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are back in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident were affected extensively in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 per cent of its agricultural land, whereby only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed farmland can be re-used in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland from Fukushima lie in the "nuclear borderland."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist arrivals in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal dwellers find it more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to determine the overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuation ones. she asked her about the state of rebuilding and how her feeling has changed vis-à-vis the tsunami-risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction to this article, the Kahoku Shimpo paper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami-consciousness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed find that still not enough in terms of disaster prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to evacuate Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue to commemorate the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also stepped up its attention to the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had to witness the huge earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture also witnessed the worst, disaster-induced, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160 000 people evacuated from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, were resettled into permanent placements.</seg>
<seg id="580">At the end of 2017, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">Most of the evacuation centres in the disaster areas are older than 50 years old. they are known to fail because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When one meets people from other countries speaking another language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often notices that one connects more than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global links are important because they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives, and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at these global links. in our Into the Deep podcast, we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members, who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over voice and country boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how a hike has strengthened their affection for Iranian culture; Violeta Camarasa looks at the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="594">Right: Mateus Ferreira da Silva on a widespread photo.</seg>
<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit: last Friday, a police officer had struck him against the head during a demonstration in Goiânia. nationwide, millions of demonstrators participated in a protest march against austerity measures.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Physicians operated on this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás confessed that Sampaio was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident from the active ministry.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer how he hits Goiânia with his baton on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be seen on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnealizador," a media activist from Goiânia, shared the video taken by Luiz Luz on the net in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics are hurrying shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from a different perspective, is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below, you can see the attack on Mateus off the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another state, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian real relays (approximately 2,700 euros) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Goiânia while he is in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for more violent attacks against activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás has experienced a wave of political violence: here, the activist Guilherme Irish was murdered by his father, supported by the Occupy movement in secondary schools. here, the military police of a WhatsApp group joined, only to criminalize teachers, and here we have a very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a policeman who has struck him with a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police assaults</seg>
<seg id="615">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Goiás was not the only state in Brazil where there was brutal police action against protesters last Friday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen put in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had set up a stage for orators, rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MP Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstrators via loudspeaker announcements.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Again, the Brazilian media covered street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo talked about a broken glass window in order to design their front pages illustratively with a photograph.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, O Globo preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic ground to report more about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of property damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here, too, the term "vandalism" is an absurd, disproportionate importance, and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by headlines with the title "protesters on confrontation with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">The Uncharted villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba closed the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The municipality of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as the "Central - Spanish Sugar Mill," notwithstanding that there is no significant sugar crop on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After lying down, the sugar cane industry was still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the steel and concrete framework remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commuting daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier's veteran who is standing up every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive period are back into operation because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor administration decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for unrest for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price climbed over a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the "Agricultural Prospects" published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "" "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is "deceit."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents said: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">In front of the first closing year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was a matter of officially authored documents which differed only concerning the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was surpassed and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">For two years, Juan Carlos Rivero was in charge of the closed factory and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories which were yet in operation," he affirmed.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, awaits the retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>

<seg id="690">Take a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do this via hip hop, thanks to a series of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshops lead mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is making sure that the young participants explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self acceptance" or whatever comes into mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">For example, this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribal area of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia relates, for example, the history of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a road section in western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">Most of the cases have not been clarified.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths do not always master the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available, as is a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is the day when you will forgive our cry." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="708">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "because we have lost our way in life as a youth." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and promote our youth as well.</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they determined the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary section, the reader and advocate of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also adds a contribution and adds the verse to syllabus (which is also published on his blog and is republished here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, they are displayed in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (the in-board, "plastic models of dishes") of every dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether to enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry devoted to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the toky district of Kappabashi there are a large number of these small companies that produce plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usual that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend turns them into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver matome the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sales: new mobile tapes, decorated with plastic dishes, as shown at the Tokyu Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial food items have been turned into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shoebox fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food reserves is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we have found a good use as mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here's an apple that holds your mobile:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing departure into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some cell phone support and cell phone designers allow you to create your own work of art. in this case, ikura or salmon scammed is used, a popular topping, which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">Some users had doubts on Twitter:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there someone who would say: "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with laughing betrayals?"</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">There are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further bizarre plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly only appear in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, head of the Sinaloa cartel, completely repressed the stories of the victims of the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the mourners or the congregations that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each body, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político created the digital project "apportions a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "to live with drug trafficking") which is to give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who were in the struggle between the law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime lets us not only fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The impact is much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vida que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear life changed") tells precisely these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on just a single day.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "" "" "priests:" "" "" "" "like every Sunday we are preparing again today for the task we have set ourselves to seek out and to search for graves after the people we loved." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community conflicts, fragility and state leadership." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a teacher of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it appears:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known disease and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">Every day I pass newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues writing:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants Narco (German: drug dealers) if he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic" of the perpetrators when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">The intimelessness of the people is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified by the fact that they were "rebellious."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they remain spared from such tragedies when they are not moving and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "Four months blackmail in the main town district:" how a family has been plundered with threats. "this describes how armed criminals were forced to squeeze money out of their business for month until they destroyed not only the business but also torn their families apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of all that you have lost, and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes away, the trauma stops, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want others to be arrested, for they don't know when they will deceive you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days if weeping would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "" "" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "" "" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence drawn generation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells us he had to teach himself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years earlier when he saw only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, which had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Ombudsman for Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office amounted to 3103 killings. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 killings per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organised crime in Mexico and which invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever-new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the "api a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político created the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking that has tormented the country over the past four decades.</seg>

<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank car traversed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, dumped and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the streets in the region became dangerous paths filled with potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Officials described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses including a movie theatre nearby, which was full of people watching the FIFA World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charted corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to infinity.</seg>

<seg id="833">It shows rows of carbonized bodies lined up on the floor while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was taken on social media, blogs and other platforms several times, falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian settlements of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses drastically reported atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "" "" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "" "" "no one remained behind to count corpses," "" "" "" "said a person to Human Rights Watch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time could only be depicted on the basis of satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unclear, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the Boko Haram's attempt to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this improper use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of misfusions; Africa check has documented authorisations to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Even one step further, personal commentaries, such as this example, mistakenly assume the image of the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange has also appeared in connection with the fatal persecution of the Rohingya Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning report, published by the United Nations, those who could flee were beaten, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about violence against Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following, who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi-Arab news page, which wrongly claimed Myanmar's Than being, monks and politicians allegedly participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions on the silence associated with the assassination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">But a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are umpteen people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Does this mood of false and misinformation suggest that actual atrocities are untrue and the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The distribution of violent pictures has already been debated in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that keeping images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowledging the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, there is a concern that violent pictures are desensitizing readers and viewers and taking the ability to empathy (such as this study, which examined how violent media seem to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss regarding violent representations in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something that can actually be used detached from the context or in a completely improper way.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons uses according to CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog called untranslatable (irreplaceable) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone stubbornly resist every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from the Tameroom language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Take care of your parents in recognition of how they have endeavored you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsusk language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">Kwadi - The comfort or laziness you feel after cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words about his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defy other cultures, reveal other ways of thought, and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page want to publish more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these little languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the Treasure Languages, which are appreciated by untranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite words here.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art seeks to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect with someone here and now in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling initiative (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible response.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the language diversity of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, there is a risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project, the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that assume diversity - safe spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listening frequently is connected to understanding," these events are instead "listening to" to appreciate, to make sense. "</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, stories tell their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional story-teller, their devotion and their depiction lead to the fact that the audience settles on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassiduou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamuchara tells the tale of the rabbits and the baboon in Shona, Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his fable, John Nyamuchara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were alert...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a reexamination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amount to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017. the march started with the Mexican Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Citizens's Front for the Neural Integration of Debt) and the ecumenical church meeting Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of reestablishment of debt also submitted a petition to the official home page of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the people of Puerto Rico demand that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts must be held accountable for their corruption." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">This year's re: publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is held in Berlin, devoted itself to an event of the # Freebassle campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Director of Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints' produced books within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Surgical Research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and available free of charge here contains a number of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It's a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction, it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what are the real costs associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and in order to create some sense from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the Adra prison's directory, where he lodged on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title of collective memory gives his friends and family a voice that pushes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, right away.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in free culture, many of us have let us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and choices.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police Bassel was on the basis of a" strictly secret "commanded by the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people who presented themselves as insider of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and conditions remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role in extending the access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry mortgore, a designer, technologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basel's cultural prototypes was more predictive than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influence.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would do everything possible to wipe out this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedient in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel did not finish this project until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life in dreaming of freedom, and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am overwhelmed when I call his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel told me English, even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He gave me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prodigy that she wrote in the years 2012-2015 her husband when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated her from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the 2011 protests against the Bashar al-Assad regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under force by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">By 2016, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in detention since 2011 according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambique responded with anger to a corruption case where a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state machine where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It concerns Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 together with four other defendants for the dissenting of 54 million Metics (some 800 000 euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good management and immediately called for his re-appointment to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the motion, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to resume his old post, since the company did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not expect the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), condemned the decision of the company to address the director again in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and underlines the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in view of the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should have initiated a disciplinary action against the abductor.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently remained silent and did not make reasonable legal action for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case to be "offensive":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would have been adviser after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which served to eat.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has agreed to be integrated into the company which he helped to harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence.</seg>

<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he was insulting him. I can't believe that someone was rewarded with such a massive insult to the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing to return to the state and serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served only himself by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state when it was an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remember that a thief is in prison:</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the known social network took their posts from the grid because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censuses the word "Kalar" or the "Kalar" (in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma within the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word in itself does not automatically evoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they discussed the use of the word or doubts expressed in order to use the word have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written in Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spider bse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooky Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a play.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also emphasised that Facebook must be more analytic before releasing all posts that would be suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "" "" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "" "" "Kalar" "" "" "" "manually." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you are writing on Faceook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What you should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who disseminate hate speech will receive fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise her nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who distribute hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have demonstrated that the censorship of catchwords often becomes a cat and mouse game, with the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post office "did not meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a lot of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet Community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they did this without local context or technical support, and banned words such as "chair" or "inheritcurry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsely deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had a little bit more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a great deal of sales, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook Auto censorship has provided users with a lot of ridicule.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the web.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, Parliament of the country unanimously approved a law to ban this practice so that the age of marriage is now 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">In May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the Interreligious Organisation (IRO), a group representing the representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere since that, age does not determine maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This is notwithstanding the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contracting party of the UN child rights convention, the minors as, "defined every man under the age of 18."</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married to 15, in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office of the country confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 from 1997 to 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that endeavored to prevent children's age followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the marriage, they were supposed to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition led to tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and at some point there were doubts whether the opposition would agree to the bill in general.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the birth of children - despite 4 senators (among them a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be announced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's Senators gave a status update on Facebook, which Leslie Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was decided at the House of Representatives with 35 votes and not one single.</seg>
<seg id="1357">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "after it was decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled, because the laws for children's marriage were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who wears a ministerial office in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk disguised at the heart of the matter, but do you know what? the marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's worth almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was the opinion, it took a long time to complete the practice, Lara Quentall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had finally arrived:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook from Lara Quentralis - Thomas, which states:, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the law has been decided." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, votes - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folly Mutota, a member of the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group who spoke openly about the importance of adopting the law, said:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The marriage-capable age in Trinidad and Tobago now amounts to 18 years, regardless of the religious affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft amendment has been adopted today, on June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 MPs in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present during the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "all deputies who were against have voted for the law." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1370">The marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>

<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Maharaj, therefore, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaj announced his intention to take judicial steps, the law should be passed and he seems to release his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al Rawi, a proponent of the law, said it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most social media users wished they would address the debate on the subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Vorrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Rather than talking about the problem, instead of talking about the problem that we, instead of talking about the problem, would simply talk about the fact that the state, our daughters, protects them from being misused by large, hard-boiled men who are opposed to them, "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a legal action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children's marriage is legal or still the norm, even though there are laws that prohibit them.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring websites, Turkish users can view Wikipedia contents again</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has locked the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series oppose the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to using bypassing tools for blocked web pages (a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third biggest VPN-prevalence of the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking an article from Wikipedia such as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blocking of the Internet has been held since 2007, after the Internet Law (No 556) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second best-known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">One solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized Peer-to-Peer network, which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available, despite legal restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything in place to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents on decentralized and distributed mode.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is just screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to bypass the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedia, a MirrorPage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors when locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member as well as collaborators at Mozilla at the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server further directs the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia, even if it is locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Because this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A Suhlender Nashorn, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never happy with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with badly positioned motives and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Neptune's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when I suddenly called me Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was already standing by face to face to the face of the face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't disturb the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the Buweik appeared. he immediately sat down, we look at him and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent to take photographs of Otters at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could take pictures of a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was republished here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid pronouncing the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "" "" "instead they use a pronoun or say" father of my child. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that because of the social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by a mock trial from the Indian state Odisha and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married couple with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition not to name their wives also by name is common among men. however, they have far fewer rights to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the little village of Walhe in Pune County, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health staff and housewives, stood by a unique club and became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of the 56 clubs there are in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is operated by the video Volunteers community and sets up for the dismantling of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children's treason up to the exile of HIV and AIDS victims, and manages this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She tells us how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors for change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in their discussion round was about women who did not name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the name of their husbands, is a custom that they have been dutiful and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition attests that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered deceitful, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never made any thought until this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try at home as it is running.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Prakash, my husband, turned around and said I should call him from now on his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to tell her husband's name with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked all, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can name us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "" "" "shouldn't it be equivalent?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of a centuries-old tradition in which married women should never speak out the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only smoked in front of herself during the whole exercise; another decided to let the whole frustration come out against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on her faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenaline rush of having broken with an old custom, the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife couldn't stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "" "" "another woman said:" "" "" "" "Rohini thought I should do it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation took place in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zinced red dot on the forehead that indicates the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would carry the zinced red point if he did it also." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped altogether, but think they are now in a better position, even to choose to not wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place to exchange views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we make a trip with every discussion club." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunches and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "I don't want women to worry, who could hear what could hear," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In recent months, for the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they are.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried out saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most people this is okay, but some wanted to wear a saline Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of argument and discussion about the advantages of their own coat-election, the morality associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of tas (top shirts) into a discussion round so that women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to make a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed since the first discussion club in the five months, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far, we have only done small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped saying the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discus club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as the haggling over more freedom of movement or the choice of clothing - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">As Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the video Volunteers Community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1549">On June 29th of this year, the Hashtag has been to be found in the japanese Twitter trend, where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The Beatles visit in Japan in 1966 is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who exclusively interviewed the Beatles 1964 in London, noticed in 2016 on the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to make the Japanese run through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here soon became aware that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," said Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! today the Beatles Memorial Day is in Japan. they have been here in Tokyo for 51 years.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Still today songs are sung by the Beatles in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The Beatles kitsch survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is the day of the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll should represent John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese also make pilgrimages to the known places associated with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places you absolutely have to visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Matthew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (New York Memorial)</seg>

<seg id="1583">The police of Zambézia warned the population that bald men in Mozambique could be the target of attacks.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald people for organ trafficking, presumably for abusive purposes, is disturbing the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs had been taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently they confessed that the organs of Shamans in Tanzania and Malawi are being used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There are local superstitions that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC declared.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the target of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN carried out a mission in the South African country in 2016 to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, particularly in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat this superstition and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the town of Maputo.</seg>

<seg id="1596">Attention to cahle males who travel to Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks, warned the Mozambican police after the latest assassinations of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the area where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambe in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police are already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, Province of Zambézia, for probably abnormal Rituals, has cultural motifs and is commissioned by the traditional shamans.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared on Facebook the chronicle of Bloggers poor Snaippa, who suggested that the problem is part of the major social difficulty that Mozambique is faced with:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÖCHTE GERNE EIN Mozambique, THE SME ashamed A country in which the people would be ashamed to demand sex against good marks, and would even take their lives to earn their bread, a country in which men would be hunted or bald or bald for abusive uses or "black magic."</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some missed the opportunity for macabre humour.</seg>
<seg id="1605">Zenaida Machado, scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user, tweetete that both the chief of the district Morrumbala, Pedro Sapange, and also the police spokesman Zambézias, Inácio Dina, are both bald:</seg>

<seg id="1625">Free Bassel: netizen Under Serious Threat, December 2012 (in English) New response from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel Prize winners and dissident Liu Xiaobo</seg>
<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized due to liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state), having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Liu's case as an "an internal affair," and a spokesman told that he considered it "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China continues to receive calls from the international community, Nobel Peace Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some foreign reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway, Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about the release of Lius.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a standstill after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government told that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed until December last year. Norway signed an agreement only in June to resume the salmon business to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up its prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top-ranking diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Liu as she announced in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we at the same time expect China to lift up all the limitations of Mr. Liu's wife and family members." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all visits they desire, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">USA</seg>
<seg id="1652">Us Ambassador Terry Branstad announced that the Americans "wish him the possibility of treatment abroad, in so far as he can help him recover."</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokesperson for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on 27 June that the Embassy asks the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but to free his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The request of the US Embassy drew a furious reply from China, with the statement of the State Department that "no country has the right to interfere and have irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told the couple that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice, to which it claims according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1659">Germany, Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin hoping that Liu "receives all the medical support he needs," and that a "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping published on 7 and 8 July at the G20 Summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing's news agency Reuters said that China had great concerns about whether the fuss about Liu could overshadow the visit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada, Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum urged China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP beforehand that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to say:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release those rights campaigned for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France, France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's foreign ministry requested China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments it needs, regardless of where it is needed. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there will be no further information whether France will ultimately receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan cover in Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of Continental Affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Liu and to show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progress Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned about Liu in an explanation on June 28, and announced that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and which he was severely punished had led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed Charter 08 which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or Country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the state New York Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticized Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked if New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The Cavalierio blog accuses the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable land, one hears that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries" in the face of this, he appeared invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">It has, on the other hand, defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core point of the subject, the good old lyre pops up from authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, abandoning the distorted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, in the last week of Shanmugam, the responses to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really were not answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He was able to answer corresponding questions with non-responses of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our inexpensive K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point if it was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his comment on the blog, he points out that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference to better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Please read the address.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said Singapore is more of a "city" than a country, "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so uneven, even if we enjoy free and fair elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore to cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said that Singapore was not a country, "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam who, as the leader of an advancing generation, makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am very embarrassed about what the minister of justice said in Singapore..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of Singapore political leaders, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it, and is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "" "" "Mr. Shanmugam has committed" "" "" "" "good faith a mistake" "" "" "" "or was it a Freudian-speaker?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only viewed as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, to which country are the sovereign rights of the city Singapur back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of grave importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapur afford their military service, do they defend only their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our prime minister have to pay back bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink ID card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>

<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I didn't tell what I said..." "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered many people of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band celebrated in Thailand has released a music video released by the Junta, which took power in 2014 and despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the precepts of his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not specifically politically, the music video relates indirectly to the continuing military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days, the video posted on Facebook was shared 1,254 times and received 8,800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, in particular how it behaves in the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video that refers to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of girls" may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives absolute discretion to the supreme commander of the army about important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th Rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious program of "changing the attitude" of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are considered critics of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was established in the army which monitors online content and people accused of having slandered the monarchy is prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand uses a strict secrecy against "Lese Majest" (Majesty's offensive).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was declared in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, it came to a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems the Junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video, it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van, before putting them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>

<seg id="1804">The post-war society is recovering very slowly in East-Abchasia, above all in the district of Tkucumal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">Now over 20 years have passed since the Georgian-Abchassic war has officially ended, but its scars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal show striking pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages like Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharsignava are located in the coal basins of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups like Russians, Greeks, Asia Minor, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, most of the Russians and chases live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkucumal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district has amounted to 16,000, having barely climbed over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1830">Now there is only paved road with faded grandeur buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1831">The people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district.</seg>
<seg id="1832">In the ghost town of Dzhantukha approximately fifty inhabitants live.</seg>
<seg id="1833">About 38 people live in Akarmara, in the other villages it looks similar.</seg>
<seg id="1834">The Khrushcheowkas, which still accommodate one or two families, can be seen on the balconies, where linen is dried.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and golden earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approximately 2.50 dollars the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom, there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells, people come in full minibus and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some also slept outside on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill, they buy them drugs that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with their daughter Merrui who has a moustache) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to be able to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">"" "" "" "we feel very comfortable here." "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard about other companions from Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans are already talking about Whatsapp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy grew weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will get in touch with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," "" "" "" "he answers smiling." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells her guests often send text messages when they have gone to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It declares that their Christian faith is the driving force of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chickens like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family welcomed migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his home for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a stove outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have lived in the United States," "" "" "" "he tells." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "" "" "there are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula arrive from central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and a stranger, a single mother, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next steps.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the corridors, the travellers quietly consult their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy about her house full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she smoothes in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with african hair care, which she made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, young and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, while she puts her in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron" repeats it every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A point-of-the-art check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users received a mobile notification in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi, in which it instructs the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Clean").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "" "" "in the message it is said that the app" "" "" "" "prevents access to terrorist information" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities could also use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police reported that the app would investigate and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with "illegal religious" activities and "damaging information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a security service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic sites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the minors for minors is meant to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Of course, an app with these functions can be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications on digital censorship in China focus mostly on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often dark for those who live in distant, afflicted ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in the conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China" (which was published on Twitter), the censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police inspectors checked the residents indiscriminately if they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification called for people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered by a checkpoint with a device without this software, you could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have forced people to use appliances that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the rest control technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">It also published a Jingwang product description, from which it appears that the software can lift up the key requirement of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and cell phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and affiliated institutions, including universities and research institutions, are required to follow the cyber security office instructions when operating their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their "personal ID cards, cell phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" at local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the rights of Urumquis's three million inhabitants and grants them penalties for a whole series of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2008">I broke the silence by screaming several times "Allahu Akbar" from my house roof.</seg>

<seg id="2090">Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about LGBTQ + community rights, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he drops to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips covered with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the topmost floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felahyeen (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist opposed to the conservative majority and questioned its well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed music.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his home town of Amman, but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to Sri Lanka.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by boundaries in his mind, and according to his own statement he can sympathize with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he has a particular aversion against U.S. foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation," he describes himself even when he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't think so because of my own circumstances," "" "" "" "emphasizes Hdaib." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a human being, while in water he pours over Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the lusts of lukewarm coffee and the squadron of the Kent-cigarette in the nose first of all speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a jail in the open air, especially if you have a look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to avoid doing basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Ministry of the Interior of Jordan had cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Sinno contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert statement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former press spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which makes the old-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continued to "stand up for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement may not be simply shallow rhetoric, but actually reflect an ever more clearly emerging reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib drew traditional gender norms to Leibe by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should really trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"" "" "" "in Jordan, the number of" "" "" "" "Volunteers" "" "" "" "has increased in Jordan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a 1954 Act on the Breaking of Crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be held in prison indefinitely," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic expenditure, as well as the guarantee on the part of the family, are necessary for the woman to do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib's music is very popular and is well-known for not shy away from topics that have long been considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denied that his work is political, but admits that his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "" "" "politics was introduced to me," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib tackles the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song entitled "Santander."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song one verse is repeated conspicuously often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one can, in his words, "get what you want" - whether it is faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about gay rights and lesbians, and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to later point out that his comments were torn out of context, twisted and his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded with no cuts, but scattered but only a revised version," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib advertises the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance to homosexuals does not entail Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nueva, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains remembered, thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuis, who would later work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can't Jordan do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service held several former members of the government and members of the teacher's association, arguing that in social media commentaries were critical of the problems associated with deep-rooted corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the concert Hdaibs believes that only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to create a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has prevented Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's what Hdaib - consists of slow, deliberate and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also about "experiencing it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be approached with a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions, and artificial forms of democracies. at the very least, it hopes this.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore resist.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warriors dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One suspects that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the bangs, the drums and dancing have been handed over over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan walked into the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community center in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two solid cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only True - and in addition a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, outward appearances and personal care were as important as in this story because they help to keep Peruvian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population in this region does not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru, like many other Central and South American countries, is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and thus also the fallen hairstyles of famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go into the skilled hands of hairdressers that can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts compete against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks, as can be seen in the following video (more videos on current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to persuade young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in hairdressers instead of bad advice that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the article "love messages to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it much more important to accommodate people who feel poisonous?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This was exactly the question of the young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga from the Bogotá Foundation and Cristian Palacios of the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the Carta por la Reconciliación Campaign, encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently was their country the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla movement, which is the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the sign of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, before the Colombians, there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years, exposed to war rhetoric and carrying out their weapons around the clock must now reintegrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take up their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would have to close together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The target of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter who will then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureate, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more urgently.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now, more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogota.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogotá Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC have set up as they did before to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," said the policy student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a staff member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter made me move through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a MGL-grenade, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "" "" "he answered," "" "" "" "Hello, what are they doing right now?" "" "" "" "he answered," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have never written such a beautiful thing in my life, so I reply to it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, he was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companions of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. joining the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">So far I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "" "" "but now where there is peace, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start, students and some FARC leaders came together for a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC have declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have witnessed the social injustice on the part of the State on the whole Colombian people. now that we have the opportunity to develop a political party, we can help shape society in this country more equitably.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "" "" "a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "" "" "said one of them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often saw and hated as monsters, were also only people with beautiful feelings that were turned upside down by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and embrace.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the town of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Columbians were prophesied that peace would prevail after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people ready to resort to arms, raise themselves and protest for their rights. and this is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we of the FARC now put on peace, a policy without weapons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those dreaming of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and sacrifice, for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence become many difficulties impending.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2247">Several months ago, the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has won the international headlines after a report has been published that addresses the deportation, torture and killings of queer men in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Novaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities who arrested suspects of queer men and put them into secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a Transwomen, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">She had already felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she grew up she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens had learned about the gender balance of their landlady, the hunt for Sabrina was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2254">She moved out of fear about her life in the end to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer helper in a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While trying to help her, someone from whom I thought he was a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya who can remove this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos from my documents throughout WhatsApp made the rounds.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was picking up a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard another sentence, but this time in Chechnya: "how long do you still want to dishonour the family, you shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had got everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two spikes in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which case wings were you laid - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are out of date, there is my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February, I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They presented absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by running at the top without through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grozny saying that I hadn't changed my gender, that everything was just bad talk, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have cup size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family manage to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "" "" "they said to her," "" "" "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has disappointed not only your family, but the whole republic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "" "" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she laid a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, under the window stood a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time it became clear to me that there was a bit lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">Appendix Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something implausible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering at me, without identification, without all.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe me, you're sure just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are in. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "" "" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about gender equality, it is a taboo theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements still carry me in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to avoid hurting her." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2319">When chatting with camera, I really bother to look at the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I talked to someone who has been eating in argun for one and a half months." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all could hardly wait for the end of Ramadan, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still being held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there are not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, above all, those who have no wealthy relatives or who were dropped from their relatives in order to face Kadyrows's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "" "" "say:" "" "" "" "should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked any village or military base." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people had not simply disappeared, they were deliberately submerged to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not introduced as bandits, but there have been no reports about this yet. but we assume that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation already took place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think I was already known in the whole of Grozny before 2003 when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Serious in serious!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was a sharia, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia originally wanted to introduce us to "civilisation," but eventually rejected us into the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the law of sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were hatched; I had tinted eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Health of Sharia has never even curbed my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew of it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never offended me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this Gnome time last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began talking about morality in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us per se, but above all about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had smiled and laughed beforehand looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In that time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic steadily worsening.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacrees, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food types.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have not paid a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I clapped some kind of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">Appendix Media: are you wearing a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chetschenen, who want to make you white with foam in front of your mouth, that there are no owls with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestan, the Kabardines, have what, the Russians have whatever; on the whole planet they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men out of the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who walk to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think about men who love males and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry I'm going to be here so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahrazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahraz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">There has been a strong rise of suicide since the last few months.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Democratic Movement in Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man called Jassim Moramazi on August 27th drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahrazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness that could arise for his family, so Ahrazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwa and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was taken to the Taleghani hospital in Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahrazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahrazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid manian, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have appealed.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families on account of the persecution of the Iranian government, and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahrazi suffers from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahrazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab ancestor was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy was taking power and in 1925 saw great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most productive and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">In spite of these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little of that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahrazi-Arabs working places in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a multitude of dams, which divert water from the Arab areas into the Persian countryside, where the provinces are Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravating the devastation caused by dryness, and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawk adolescents has now increased to 81%." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director of Cooperatives, Labour and Social Welfare reported that 5% of Ahwazis who are looking for a job completed primary school, 55% completed secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimbi, an Iranian Ahrazi human rights activist with resident in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," led to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young Ahrazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ahraz's new ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions do not prefer to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahrazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their living outside their home country.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahrazi and be stopped, as even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Ahrazi has to endure, human rights activists are alerted before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking notice of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website of Afrofoéminas. the article was the subject of several discussions, in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I come to speak on skin color, to black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused in racial separation and discrimination, in both as well as outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and sing" Kumbaya, my Lord "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to say that in addition to sexualized violence there is an institutionalised form of racial violence that we are exposed to black women in a twofold manner.</seg>
<seg id="2450">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "or about that black women and women of other ethnic and country of origin earn less than white men and women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin colour to have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I can not join a movement in which the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in her thinking, which refer to both the sex and the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sojourner complained in her speech in 1851: "am I not a woman?" and I also refuse to perpetuate an ideology in which the black woman is in historical terms a demented and marginalized Being.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation to advance their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlap of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to instruct them of the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different income a home and isolate themselves from white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and join me in the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than using me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women to define ourselves according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming (e.g.: Africa Womanism: how we recapture ourselves) says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can in this way also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can uplift black women and women from other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognised as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment in which my life has neither ignored, nor ignored, nor rejected." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and revised version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# willieinefrault), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police inspector, Ada Báez, said that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent towards her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the acts, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As another wife of Balbuena pointed to mistreatment, Ada Báez also reported nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman drew back her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women make a refund at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit being victims of violence must be reported to law enforcement agencies.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Contents1 Strikes and Statistics 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system that has nothing inferior to Paraguays laws: good approach, inadequate implementation of punches and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to find out how many women are really abused, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudio, a social science research facility in Paraguay. "there are different data and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Attorney filed 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the advertisements were reported by women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts. here, too, 86% of the advertisements were made by women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements 40% of women said they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women minister, Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "for every woman who is refunded in Paraguay due to psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do so.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "there are two women who do not do this," "" "" "" "she explained at the end of 2014." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder in Paraguay is not a crime of its own, law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists included at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The human rights coordinator in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay all ten days die of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a judicial system that does not undermine</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became a friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning, she didn't want it, but then she asked.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer collaborating with Carlos. but for two years she has endured psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would be a victim of abuse once.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it, I always thought that it only happens to women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote articles on Facebook, in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had been attracted by Carlos for so long and did not leave him in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that the victims of abuse had at least a certain complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner abused her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network ("I believe you"), which consists of women, who are all victims of abuse in some way.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the testimonies of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against her former partner, who developed into an unmanageable legal fight between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly concerned about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill of law was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# fürst).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-income) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the bill foresees Feminid to declare a perpetual criminal offense and to punish it harder than the case already in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the law text was changed in a number of points, in order to also win the deputies for the law that would be denied the way for decriminalisation of abortions, which are currently banned in Paraguay and punishable with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had intended to pay much of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence themselves have to bear, if they simply submit an ad and want to obtain a safe accommodation to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay mistreatment is seen as part of inter-human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer seen as normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "whoever is silent in the face of these facts is complicit and helps the perpetrators get away." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to refund so long that mistreatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed by the Paraguayan Senate. prior to that, parts of the law had been changed. among other things, a passage was cancelled which called the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconcile.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions on the changes are taking apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The submission of words "gender," "political force" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law, however, is considered a great setback.</seg>

<seg id="2546">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this website has been locked on the website of the banned newspaper Azamn" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the omanic authorities closed the independent Arab-language newspaper Azamn because of their reporting on corruption in the sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison where he is serving a one-year prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and tried, but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after he had put his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d'état.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, he has held the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Finance, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces, in particular domestic intelligence, public freedom, including freedom of press, restricting and detaining human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>

<seg id="2554">The attack on Azamn, its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors, last year, is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper reported since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces seized Ibrahim Al-Maamari, editor in chief of Azamn, after having published an article entitled "High-ranking Parties to the hands of the judiciary" in the newspaper on 26 July 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2557">In the report, government officials were accused of putting pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance case.</seg>

<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, ISS captured the Deputy Editor-in-Chief Yousef Al-Haj, who acted as chief editor at Al-Maamaris.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The paper was closed indefinitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that "publication and distribution of the newspaper was prohibited by any means, including online, from 9 August 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the first trial was held in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court sentenced the three journalists to prison and also ordered the newspaper's final closure.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted of disturbance of the public order, "misuse of the Internet" and "undermining the state of the state."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, Al-Haj was found guilty of infringement of a ban on publication and slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fines in the amount of 3000 omanic Rial (7800 US dollars), and a one-year ban imposed on the two journalists was imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of using "an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">A security deposit was set for Al-Abri in the amount of 5000 US dollars (13,000 US dollars) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 before the pronouncement of the sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, but sentenced el-Haj to six months in prison for a year and Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 following a six-month prison sentence from the Central Prison. al-Haj remains in prison, where he is serving his one-year prison sentence.</seg>

<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the Court to allow Azamn to resume, the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Afghan government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once again opposed the decision of the Court of Appeal to allow publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing shutdown of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently breached the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Further injuries include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the country's first independent online newspaper to stop its operation.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with its consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on-site: firstly, the global healthcare sector lacks many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for researching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research carried out by African scientists is helping to develop its own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of central lab at the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic revealed first serious effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the Sambian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. in doing so, I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I am currently starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and generally in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always stay beneficiaries instead of being a mover myself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GM: where does financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are promoted differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Lab material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific education starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, healthcare (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa over Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it's the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment (the so-called "paywall") also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the US to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This contribution by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many different kinds of salads he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents applied not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or curled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more patents are applied to more and more plants such as cereal or cartons. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition Morton is still breeding a salad, but it takes longer as his work is becoming more and more difficult due to the increasing restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is as if a boulder in a river would lie in order that I have to paddle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do that now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think that these patents go too far on salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when they stand in front of the court, no one can breed a new type of lettuce, because all the characteristics are already patented. "he continues to do as good as possible and tries to breed the characteristics he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and around the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts at the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman Salat of the Outredgeous variety in the "glasshouse" of the station. it is used to test whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for Open Source Seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative called Ossi, US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others to cross their seeds in order to breed their own varieties and do not immediately issue it - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed, according to him, plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or little by raising seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability," he says, and refers to the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry. "those who want to buy good locally and sustainably produced vegetables should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "" "" "food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seed is not possible." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">Members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seeds remain freely available to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seeds and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool shrinks continuously due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus becoming more limited.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with a genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found that about one third of all the antitrust features are protected as intellectual property, which makes it difficult for plant breeders to be used at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates do not yet exist, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown so that they have specific desired traits - from those through which their taste or colour improves to such as they thrive in certain environments and can withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders leaves more and more patents. genetic diversity is at present more needed than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an email, Monsanto recognizes Carly Scaduto that genetic diversity is generally important and also essential for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and co-operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts the notion that Intellectual Property offers other breeders, because "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "" "" "thus, such protection does not inhibit innovation, it promotes it by providing more material and expertise to the public." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this differently: waiting for 20 years, until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed crops that are adapted to changing environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "" "" "this is what drives us and it becomes impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">All in all, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant characteristics: "we do not really create the features ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as breeders, we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery to nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, Plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi-Board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who bred a variety also breeds its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation it is necessary to produce mass herbicides, breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "" "" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such as moving on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are patents), most smaller seed companies can also survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I'm using my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors will sell my grades for themselves in a few years, "he says." with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years, which makes it very easy for my opinion. "worldwide response</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is introducing an open-source seed program. to preserve the seeds of traditional crops, the Centre works with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation Agrecol is working on an open source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Ossi's commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding are different from country to country, so the Ossi obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the European Commission's executive, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable, thus addressing the current practice of the European Patent Office, which permits patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An explanation, however, is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on open source seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend for seed patenting.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' Open Source seed systems program, explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open-source seed systems to be the official starting signal for the next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">An association of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - published a report. it believes that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed, exchange and improve seed policy, thereby ensuring a stable supply of food.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a link that Luby of Ossi hopes to see more people soon.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the movement for regional and organic food has largely paid attention to where and how something is grown and seed systems have hardly played a role," says Luby.

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest censorship objectives in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still, the Egyptian authorities have been blocking content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5th August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about the above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">August, the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities criticized sharply for this step and promised to continue working and efforts on human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains true to its aim to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world and to give victims a voice. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored site of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar network of Al Jazeera due to the alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of wave of website closures to victims. @ anhri is one of the main data sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmopDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of columnists and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada no longer has access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Ziada took advantage of his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that he writes for in Egypt non-accessible websites and media." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the Egyptian government's censorship was even the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider that is also home to Ziadas blog, however, is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, reporting about the student protests and taking a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada comments on the government's distortion and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">To lock blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) They managed to convey to me the feeling of a siege. an arrest, an attempted murder, unloading at the National Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other website I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I didn't write for nothing. in other words, my words have an influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after locking it and that they're afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities closed off from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Also documented the closure of providers, through the circumvention of Internet censorship and private surfing was possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites offering VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content that could have access to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In addition, the situation is exacerbated by the fact that the censorship decisions are being taken behind closed doors, making the Egyptian population no legal basis by which they can proceed against these actions in court.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army deployed in the Favelas in Niterói, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in Brazil speak with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day a police officer will be murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "thieves rough pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers to the army, navy and air coffee to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached its highest level in Rio for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the detailed reporting of violence in Rio, the newspaper "Extra" published the editorial "This is not normal" in which she announced a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper said the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc. everything, however, deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the Columns "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to cry: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video sharing on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor in chief of the newspaper, stated that this decision is not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">An extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war crime in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist says that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to disguise atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it uses?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira is arguing that violence is a "war." this is in her opinion a justification for the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to give accountability to the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as indicated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">A reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">According to Cecília, "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country according to statistics from 2015. these are the latest available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "" "" "when we look at the murders per state, Rio is in place 16," "" "" "" "she writes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as Cecília stresses, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">The establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the Federal State of Rio in 2003, was also part of these security policy measures.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this resulted in a decrease of violent deaths. after several years, however, after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit, the UPP was increasingly under fire.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010, explaining why the violence in Rio doesn't correspond to the criteria laid down by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also entails serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost bullets."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, the fact is that the people of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago, the police cleared the mountain with the Favela Jacucinho in order to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence this incident made headlines: a fruit vendor died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to the victory of Watch, a common initiative of the PAX peace organization and the Syria Institute for the Research Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly severely affected where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations, and the Syrian opposition, based on investigations into the United Nations and other human rights organisations, assume that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas have been under siege from Damascus, which led residents to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through years of blockage, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics are teaching the inhabitants of Eastern Ghoutas how to plant their own fungi as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project jointly with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. their food, however, makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Directorate of the project, Abo Nabil, said in front of the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can be planted in houses and cellars." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowd funding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to teach 125 families to cultivate mushrooms, says Dr. Leila at Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of this article, they reached more than 100% of their expected target of about 12,700 €, but will continue to raise funds on CanDo by Monday, 4 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said that they started with the "production of fungal seeds originating from the regions" before checking their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on October 21 in many district capitals in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October. this caused the government to call for a state shower last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 eruptions spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors forest areas by satellite images, around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2847">João Soveral of the Confederation of farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After Pedrógão, streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>

<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal on the shape of the whale, which the government introduced after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law that allowed building activity to fall when the applicant had funds for self-protection - that was an open back door, so that everything could be built," João Sorval continues in the same article of the newspaper Público.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees of light flammable wood, spread like in a vicious circle, to fires of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the civil protection of Portugal on October 15th and 16th, when citizens sought information or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population, using the application fove.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial at this fateful weekend in October that the servers failed to withstand the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the site counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In one night in the autumn of 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years before, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups who had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus, Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Exactly at that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, stayed in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother did not say so at that time, she knew she would no longer see her son - perhaps no more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">At dawn, the boy should break.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick it up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahone party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban, and many of Hazara suddenly felt defenseless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Ashark returned to Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his modest wage and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and sluggish sacks with mortars who were heavier than himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, where we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"" "" "" "there were no services and no heating there. we hung Nylon at the open windows so that we didn't freeze at night." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left his life without documents in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During a dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Ashark came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time ago Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid in need twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high ratings, Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers. but it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers in the country find are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Human Rights Organization Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "" "" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in more than 3000" "" "" "" "special reception centres" "" "" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who don't have money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">That's how it happened.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his untamed régime helped to liberate himself from these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having worked for several years in the construction industry, Ashark spent his entire savings in establishing a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bite.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now the theme of the documentary entitled "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - Hazara in Italy") of director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some Afghan-powered companies, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants have been created.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant orient Experience where the waiters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the different Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs goals reach far beyond the Italian hospitality trade and the retail trade and aim back to the country that he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>

<seg id="2925">Asharaf also plans to open a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques. "this is how they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end stability and prosperity are standing.</seg>

<seg id="2928">Netizen report: Egypt's bill to shut down social networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, has been detained for more than 900 days.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearance of the Raba'a el Adaweya camp in Cairo, protesting against the suspension of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Photo taken from @ Ciluna27 on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacy's Netizen report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, wins and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">In order to be able to use social networks, users must register within six months of their full name and identity within six months of their full name and identity.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If you miss this step, you may be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or penalties pending.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was promoted by 60 members of Parliament, is currently under legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May another member of Parliament submitted a legislative proposal to introduce stricter penalties for the insult of the President or a senior official.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law proposed, such action would, however, be punished with imprisonment and fines as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this may mean up to three years in prison for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he shot Egyptian policemen, demonstrating violence against demonstrators demonstrating against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected president Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, just as more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested in the same incident four years in prison on a court date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison administration, according to the human rights groups, failed to bring the defendant from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawcane threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree on pseudo-possession, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza revealed the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were accused of reporting to pro-Morsi's sitting block on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishments of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Interrogated Tunisian activists on backed documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated by a resettled action plan. according to the plan, the President of the Republic, which explicitly supported a controversial draft bill, would ensure amnesty for business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, provided they return all unlawful monies.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on 21 April on the web site of Nawaat casts a light on how the Prime Minister looks like to support the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia refused to mention his sources under Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which journalists have granted the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Despite this, he appeared in the district court in Tunis on May 9 as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new rules of the Information Bureau of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts are suggesting that the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks should be achieved. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">"" "" "" "will we then see ourselves in" "" "" "" "WeChat" "" "" "" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">May the State censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "" "" "according to Roscabnadzor, WeChat failed to register as" "" "" "" "organiser of the information distribution" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 Act, thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the publication of information. the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and to force it on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Websites such as Vkontakte and Odnoctuniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image board 2.ch.hk, email service mail.ru and dozens of other services belong to these websites.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court features Sperm Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the Wikipedias locking in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications called on the site to be blocked because it became "an information source that collaborates with groups to instigate a political defamation campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website. it is, besides, China, one of the few countries around the world in which access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain cannot stop sniffing</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor real-time communications and install the data encryption programs.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies with regard to the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
