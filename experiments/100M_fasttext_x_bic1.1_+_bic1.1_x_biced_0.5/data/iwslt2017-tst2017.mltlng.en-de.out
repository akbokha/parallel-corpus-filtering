this is James Ris@@ en .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before anyone ever heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA has illeg@@ ally heard phones of Americans .
but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA bom@@ bed Iran literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the US government .
for nearly 10 years , the government has been investigating the Ris@@ en and promp@@ ting him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones who give them price .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many brave re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en was at risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although for years they stated that it would be essential for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped at Ris@@ en .
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , the re@@ porters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of separ@@ ators and ris@@ ons to make statements , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly worried about his telep@@ hon@@ y ,
just like its email data , financial and banking information , its credit information , and even travel tips with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ stle @-@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower coming to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional law , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone .
but just as technology allows the government to b@@ ypass the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do so from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that has not yet existed when Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than regular emails or phone calls .
one such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source distribution system for whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the here the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology men like Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to mis@@ judge off@@ ences . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers ,
who wants to know about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the care of soldiers and report from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental officer who aler@@ ts us to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , who warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the largest data leak of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set it up ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a trace of US $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others who are nervous about the next release , and the next disclosed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agency writer or John Gr@@ is@@ ham &apos;s novel .
it seems we@@ eps away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this happen to us ?
but the truth is that if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and this concerns all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some a few to hide and veil their fortun@@ es -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people all over the world seem very conf@@ using , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these signs .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is .
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the United States .
probably because there have been no prominent Americans in these revelations that preceded this sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but through the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some US states there is less information needed to provide less information to create a company than to get a library card .
this type of transparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip school children off .
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked everyone that everyone up to a lawyer made suggestions on how to transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers joined us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single leader , wrapped up in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to overcome this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may sound very fool@@ ishly as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing ever had changed ; as though there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as borrow@@ ed optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last few years we have seen suggestions for more transparency concerning the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has gathered in central registers at a national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind here .
representatives of both parties have submitted a draft bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this is not the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseu@@ do @-@ firms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the economy who get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians recognizing the problem and campaig@@ ning to end this type of transparency through laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency that now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after finishing my design studies , I made a sale of the back@@ yard .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . after that , he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me enthusi@@ astically how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
that &apos;s a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please , as please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I sm@@ ash myself ?
a wild stranger is sleeping in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , slept on to@@ e tips at the door , and closed my bedroom door .
but he was not ins@@ ane .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he bought from me today hangs in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it changed my perspective completely .
perhaps the people who were sold as foreigners in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let us take a time leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate withdraw@@ s and the rent is raised .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something about it . our apartment will be a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast .
Ah ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &apos; air mattress and breakfast &apos; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on the wooden floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ettes were completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things were rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if this could be a business concept .
this is how we presented investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they did not .
nobody , who is still with comfort , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we , as children , have learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can count on things that you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design do something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we strive for .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone in hand .
now I &apos;d like to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone next to your left sitting room .
this sil@@ ky pan@@ i@@ cking of panic you now feel -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell of a stranger in his hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es cell phone now ?
could you announce on Twitter that he is chann@@ eling for the president &apos;s office ?
you can now return the cell phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he tells us where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you have 150 app@@ rais@@ als that all say : &quot; he can really hold out very well un@@ locked cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to hand over your mobile phone ?
a well thought out feedback system boo@@ sts confidence decisi@@ vely .
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to submit negative jud@@ gements .
ultimately we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their testim@@ onies before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are in terms of age and place of residence .
surprisingly , we trust the people most that are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a natural social bias . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it becomes exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by assessments .
if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation sti@@ fl@@ es simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you buy from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you say too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one talks about too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; great works of art in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing holidays with my family . &quot;
how can we design it with design to build this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to disman@@ tle these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need not previously covered .
the business is very good for us .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who did not allow parties to celebrate parties or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront , when faith was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think of it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the c@@ aller has been and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem .
for men trust each other rightly .
if trust works , miracles can emerge .
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one .
you drive in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books .
you can stay even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay goes off .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled on this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing coinci@@ de with monetary transactions ?
it &apos;s about economic trading here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but to name it simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing will not do justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
share economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people leave a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
if you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic for it .
what if travel were a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place one visits , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub craw@@ l neighborhood that you &apos;ve never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would create apartments from the ground up for sharing ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of sharing a share ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking lots belonging to the government ,
were now offered to residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were given to people whose children had moved out . incub@@ ator programs were launched ,
to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be staying with a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as we were taught .
we didn &apos;t re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was hospitality even before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find that amaz@@ ingly ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we know of course that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this big influence , I wonder why we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the safety check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people that look like me .
one study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think most of them would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I &apos;m intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a car@@ rot @-@ fitness @-@ fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga who sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I decided to ou@@ te myself .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual human being , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was that at that time it was a feminist pro@@ clam@@ ation of independence , and the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old was to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was confident and slow , deep@@ ening with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone you perceive , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves you ?
it feels like that .
later I married and began like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had a child later , after my marriage , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that horrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should one do something like this ?
I switched to the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; ... Middle Eastern ... &quot; ... &quot; ... Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the acts of others transformed me into a suspect .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start with the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember , as I drove silent -- as deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; Be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Blei@@ b in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be ashamed . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a destination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people considered to be Muslims .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have put the anger of people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain oneself .
I don &apos;t have any questions , I love questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are accus@@ ations that are hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and include mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the US body .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumor in the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques in America make America more secure ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there may be some parking spaces , but don &apos;t stop the terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to the view of people of other faith tolerant and to show greater citizen participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently said : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or bed in front of a computer .
during the ra@@ dic@@ alization process , it has been found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their families so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts can do a bra@@ in@@ washing which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ liked by faith .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we have to stop people going to the mos@@ que .
some still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves to their imag@@ inations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam like the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holy book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into scrip@@ ture .
an outstanding ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she wanted to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister with whom she spoke was silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that had made sense to her anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this ima@@ m restored the connection with God and His church .
instead of acc@@ using them of their anger , he showed their constructive way for real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affects our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
one study shows that when people submit messages in which negative about Muslims have been reported , they would rather agree on military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of American Muslim rights .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool for tam@@ per@@ ing with the public in order to under@@ mine the foundation of free society , which has rational and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we might feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts all of us .
in the allocation of collective debt it is not only about having to explain oneself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was at the dental department , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when was such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after Su@@ z@@ anne &apos;s visit to her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , as it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we decided for the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we went sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took it out , pulled off my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had brought courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be on the safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder , what do you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a noble think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I &apos;d say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am as usual as it is allowed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
looking at Muslims all over the world , and I did this with the largest study conducted by Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want wealth for the family , they want jobs and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m in no way an exception .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about becoming a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions around the world .
before air package delivery penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower of 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting flight devices , flight devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
you can also build resili@@ ent structures on your own .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to laws of nature .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ shoot of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; external commands can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flying machine that tries to beat two flies with one flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most startup hel@@ pers , it can float , and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft does not matter in which position the optimal position is reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practice .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that are at the core of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft , which had only two movable parts : one prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ iter , the mechan@@ ically most remotely controlled aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and ru@@ dder , no more actu@@ ators or control surfaces , just one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly steady , and can move everywhere in the room .
however , it doesn &apos;t have the elegant engine of the rear star@@ ters . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it right .
the probability of throwing it right when I &apos;m all looking is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the moon is an exercise in pleasure , this machine is here , the Omni@@ teles@@ cope with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
this gives it the au@@ d@@ acious ability ,
move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned , or even how it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some are imagin@@ able in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let us look at it .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they need to be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft engines .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller comes out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly , albeit limited .
we will now demonstrate this by making half of it fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercially available micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . that is why there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there would like to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that creative , smart creations allow them to form in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes orbit@@ ed each other faster and faster in a very distant gal@@ axy , so they converted the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy .
for this short moment , they lit more bri@@ ghtly than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of all of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy did not set them free in the form of light --
finally we speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into the space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange the events tempor@@ ally .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , there arose a lot of cel@@ i@@ ac life on earth .
since then , the Earth has produced some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is standing at us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which arise approximately through col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector League : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the following years , the precision of Lig@@ o was significantly increased , which greatly improved recognition performance .
therefore , it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 Lig@@ o was started for a final test run to solve some small , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the detector was commissioned , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes flew through the earth .
you walked through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the par@@ ting of my death @-@ sick father .
basically these were the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been investigating gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their signals from observ@@ atories such as Lig@@ o . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave is a con@@ vul@@ sion in the structure of space and time .
when the wave is passed over , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and pun@@ ched into the other .
for illustration , lec@@ turers often lead to a truly alpine dance in courses of rel@@ ativity theory .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each one of us was stretched and breath@@ ed at the arrival of the waves . the stretching of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . that &apos;s why the Lig@@ o staff explained crazy .
with a five kilometer laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be accurately measured to less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the nucle@@ us of an atomic nucle@@ us . this is grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , hunting for the waves in the following way : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott lon@@ gs to say Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength far smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical because you can create an image or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming around you from several points .
it is different with sounds .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
this is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
the face of your child , for example .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to focus on the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , Alice is speaking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob is interrup@@ ting her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
with them we cannot produce simple images of objects in space .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies lie in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
to listen to the gravity , can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just about : w@@ up@@ p !
when the two bodies turn very fast , one hears the same pair of chir@@ ping with an additional key change . this sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget - Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; Som@@ ebody who knows what to hear , recognizes this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn around as quickly as the bars of your mixer .
AA : let us take a closer look at what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves an entirely new way to research the universe , as it was never before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the un@@ seen .
much in all we can &apos;t see -- practical or basically -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ ks explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
the exciting physical processes , however , happen in the core hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through because these are opa@@ que .
gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the Big B@@ ang is obs@@ cured by its own enligh@@ tening .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we can only discover by listening .
in fact Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt of things that we had not expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , such as Lig@@ o watching , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the sau@@ erk@@ raut for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars , and ultimately also how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
you can dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I experim@@ ented with an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before whom I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced &quot; yes &quot; to say .
would I speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I feared was getting rid of my fear .
my fear of holding speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life has changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , on an unexpected way . it started with a question of my small ones .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons ,
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pussy , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked her once if I could play with her when I was on the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot;
a new attitude towards life in my family . from then on , I bo@@ thered to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I am doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very proud .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; -@@ saying to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m a writer . I think about things , stir you to life .
dre@@ am@@ job job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dre@@ am@@ job job .
I cra@@ ve television . I am producing television .
I do television , in a great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
each program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
one new episode , every nine days , four shows , all nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts simultaneously in production , sometimes four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television ,
$ 350 million for a season .
in America my TV series runs one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are programs that I have created myself , and not just produced , so still overhead . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that are burning around the world .
do you know who else does that ?
nobody , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dre@@ am@@ job job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you .
I tell it because I know what you think if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you are going to run a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously when I talk about work so you understand that I am not just lying around on the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dreams in a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am immersed in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a land out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops as I painted on a canvas .
so as if you wear a high tone , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , stren@@ uous and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the sum .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a h@@ um begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could go on it forever .
many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , it does .
but the tot@@ um -- when I started working and working and making , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this tot@@ um , this energy . the tot@@ um !
the sum is more than writing .
the tot@@ um is action and activity . the tot@@ um is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the h@@ um is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a hum@@ ming , then you can no longer strive for size .
the feeling of being no different than striving for size doesn &apos;t matter what price .
this is called the sum .
or maybe it means being a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it is called genius .
maybe it &apos;s ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I just know I love the tot@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just want to say to you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
in order to clarify one thing : the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more blur@@ ring boundaries , the more work there is , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more there are expectations .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon which I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I like this h@@ um . I love the h@@ um .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I only this h@@ um ?
and then the tot@@ um stopped .
over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burnt out .
the h@@ um stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mo@@ m is a single work institute .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the h@@ um ceased .
the engine &apos;s bu@@ zz@@ ing was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was out .
the h@@ um did not come back .
my bu@@ zz@@ ing was broken .
I did the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing del@@ egi@@ ver , a Titan not sleeping , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no h@@ um .
in me was still@@ ness .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a flagship Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the sw@@ amp I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , is suddenly f@@ aded ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l made you stupid , stupid author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do , you do , you work , you love what you do , being a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz@@ ing when you know the h@@ um once you knew the hum@@ ming , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me :
first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she does not call anyone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m a titanium and my hum@@ ming shr@@ ank , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the sum@@ mons , I can do nothing but watch out .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the land I created , the marathon which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wa@@ xing pins and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl releases in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door enters and an energy boost comes in .
and that &apos;s not right away , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the money is slowly coming back .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum , but a sum .
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the sums of work , the tot@@ als of titanium , this is just the substitute .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself with the aid of broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real tot@@ um is .
the tot@@ um is no force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is the stream that comes from the z@@ est of life .
the real tot@@ ality is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz@@ ing ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the h@@ um again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not up to me as to work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what kind of person prefers to be at home ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
none of this is that I am too relaxed .
we move around in the garden , before and after , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused .
I always grab my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ um of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also ! tell them yes , if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dream .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
they have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or cookie replaces me .
and talking my teen@@ ie daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , there is no need for more .
everyone can get 15 minutes on the track , even in a bad mood day !
15 minutes a day !
no mobile phone , no clothes , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready for bed .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my oasis of well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the tot@@ um , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; games &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I &apos;ll be victorious . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more .
15 minutes a bit , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the money came back in my free time . the money seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the h@@ um , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the tot@@ um is not me ... not anymore .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my secret .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the tot@@ als of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but only a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it is a s@@ nu@@ ff to me that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said Yes to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the mar@@ sh . the country I create , the marathon which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high tone , the bu@@ zz@@ ards , the bu@@ zz@@ ards , the other , the right hum@@ ming : the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new attitude towards life is spreading within me . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things get out of mind , I &apos;m considering you to life .
that is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; wi@@ lt thou play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very small ability for self healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who is trying to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures .
certainly , they have one of the most well known ones , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one electrodes a deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from violent trem@@ ors and severe pain .
but neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story started 15 years ago .
at that time , I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that the brain sw@@ ells at the brain trauma and increases the intra@@ ocular pressure .
in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the intra@@ ocular pressure .
to do this , you sometimes have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed to do so .
that he saw under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they par@@ ted slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they stem from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage , they care for the fold of the brain .
but why do they keep us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so certain .
one thing is clear , however -- we got our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did to Jean @-@ François
and then mark them color in order to be able to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we introduced them to the collection point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- car transplan@@ t .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we reim@@ port these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we reim@@ port the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario , we reim@@ ported the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely , as if they were removed again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury and reim@@ plant@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew into mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we were able to observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ plant@@ ated .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we colored in vitro , in culture .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from brain injury ?
so we trained apes with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
you had to take pellets from one tray .
they made them very good .
when they reached a stable level of skill , we moved the motor skills area in the mot@@ oric cor@@ tex .
as a result , the apes were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hands .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they rec@@ uper@@ ate to a certain degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left , they see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see , when we reim@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the mat@@ ur@@ ation .
I can tell you that they were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ itate her in man .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giussani : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am sure that even now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these studies .
BG : that &apos;s understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years will it take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority permit us to start it soon ?
then it is necessary to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
then it is necessary to apply this to a multi@@ centre study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a great mistake to consider them self @-@ evident .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable entity .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics is completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- could not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment , I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save democracy , but that we need a genuine and def@@ en@@ sible democracy .
for without democracy our societies are bri@@ ghter , our future ble@@ ak and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a peak is known to you . you know and recognise it as the mountain of debt , which casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash that is part of the wealthy depos@@ itors and corporations , which are too fearful to invest where it would be productive and contribute money to the debt @-@ mountain and also to produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , such as green energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , railway tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 billion US dollars sounds after much money until one compar@@ es it with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing except the stock markets to infl@@ ate and apply the real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand which , as in a continuous loop , promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , in which they do not invest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invol@@ un@@ tarily , the circumstances cause the body to kill him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my quar@@ rel with capitalism --
his extremely wast@@ eful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally ended up too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to dimin@@ ish the importance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision taken by the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is , that it involved the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same m@@ oods in questions of the state che@@ ek .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted long -- though -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like a candle that shines bri@@ ghtly , it is burned out quickly .
however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies don &apos;t have roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately constituted a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy became possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , whereas the economy , i.e. the world of corporations , became a democratic zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle took place between the two , by gradually under@@ mining politics and deprived them of it .
are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as they used to be ?
it is not due to a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because today it is possible to be in the government and yet not in power , because power has immig@@ rated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my shar@@ k with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of predat@@ ors that have decim@@ ated the animals they feed on , that they are star@@ ving at the end .
the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , the inequality rises , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the managers of the corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest in the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism expelled the &quot; demos &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the prosperity of mankind .
if this is true , it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keep control , just as in ancient Athens , aside from the expul@@ sion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not particularly good .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is a solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , wast@@ eful and social conflicts lower , just as it -- very soon , as I think , will come in countries like China .
so we need to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and make sure we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re @-@ unified area , or else we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ car bureaucracy which lets the movie &quot; Matrix &quot; appear like a documentary .
the question is therefore not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements he has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; Matrix , &quot; or something similar to that of society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve humans and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life .
I think we can be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you some examples shortly .
in the area of the company : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you are working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income from capital and from revenues and the concept of wage labour are completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those belonging to the companies but not working in it , and employees who work there , but which the company does not belong to . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no emerging twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy : please introduce yourself to the fact that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
keep in mind that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that these funds are invested in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe is at the same time liberal , in which they prefer privileged individuals , and Mar@@ xi@@ an because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage dump of history , and Key@@ n@@ esian , global Key@@ n@@ esian .
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide politically together .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Luigi Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive down@@ turn in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers referred to as a &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we are currently experiencing , it will dest@@ abil@@ ise not only our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant .
as Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore , I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you are not confused , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers you said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s point of view on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area , where most of it plays , is the sphere of economy -- a fully democratic zone .
in some ways , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is today in resem@@ b@@ lance to the England of the 19th century .
because -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to present China now , to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells great for hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I gu@@ essed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say good @-@ bye to the self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ency and the continual denial that a massive down@@ turn in the euro@@ zone proc@@ eeded and continues , which massi@@ vely threat@@ ens the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first suggestion that revealed this denial --
to do it right . unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continued to choose denial .
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not capable of surviving by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you may be able to delay it for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destro@@ y@@ ingly .
BG : what changes do you anticipate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- serious ...
if there is a finance minister or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he claims he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders &apos; side to find a common solution .
but that wasn &apos;t .
they merely wanted to bring down our government , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that were running through the euro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been going through a disa@@ strous programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika credi@@ tors who imposed this policy on us stood up : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be still pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ ges will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to step into the way of a post@@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will be equally detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you will be wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price most of them have never heard before , although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company of Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an icon and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a highly competitive industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy doesn &apos;t have any choice .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right corner of this curve .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating .
if your show is valued at nine and above , it is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where after you have looked at a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left hand side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to support &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average bul@@ let , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the print is there , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and , through an evaluation , chooses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where everyone can watch them free of charge .
and when Amazon comes out for nothing , one attacks , right ?
millions of viewers are watching these episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know they are being watched by watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team that record everything .
you can record when you start the show when you pause , which parts you ski@@ ps or check again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process it and from it comes the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com of four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that many people cannot remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked out .
about at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of hosting a contest , he and his team looked at the available data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give to the shows , their history , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question is : what happened here ?
there are two very competitive , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this about ?
because logic says somehow that this should work in all .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as Back @-@ Up .
it optimi@@ zes it by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work this way , it is a bit start@@ ling because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this space ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail here in the US and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company will be used to determine whether or not a discharge occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . that &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it can predict out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way through data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year by year , until it suddenly no longer worked ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data from the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data streams into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people can use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able lots of data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you basically do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its parts , so you can analyze the individual parts ; as a two , put the individual parts together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces again even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , what else they wouldn &apos;t have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they took a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions first when they were competing for TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start controlling our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order not to forget it , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before giving data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a ja@@ - or no @-@ question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will post it later with a technique demo .
so far , I have made some decisions in my life , where I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you know of course , when you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a much wis@@ er way , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not alter the basic structure .
in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the huge amount of data , it is still paying off to make decisions , to be an expert in what one is doing , and taking risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
