<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone ever heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA has illegally heard phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA bombed Iran literally drafts for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years, the government has been investigating the Risen and prompting him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblower and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones who give them price.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen was at risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although for years they stated that it would be essential for their case, the government's demands were dropped at Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of separators and risons to make statements, that could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have secretly worried about his telephony,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its email data, financial and banking information, its credit information, and even travel tips with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistle-leblower and Risen's supposed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistle-blowers, but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower coming to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional law, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology allows the government to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do so from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that has not yet existed when Risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than regular emails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is SecureDrop, an open source distribution system for whistle-blowers, which was originally developed by the internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news site, just like the here the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer procure information, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is but a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technology men like Edward Snowden have a chance to misjudge offences. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to know about grievances in the care of soldiers and report from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental officer who alerts us to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the largest data leak of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and powerful] [enormous sums of money have hidden in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set it up?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a trace of US $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others who are nervous about the next release, and the next disclosed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agency writer or John Grisham's novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weeps away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is that if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians, how secret tax havens are used by some a few to hide and veil their fortunes -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people all over the world seem very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these signs.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there have been no prominent Americans in these revelations that preceded this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their wealth in tax havens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states there is less information needed to provide less information to create a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of transparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip school children off.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed fraudsters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we really shocked everyone that everyone up to a lawyer made suggestions on how to transfer his money." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers joined us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is not about a single leader, wrapped up in a scandal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="81">And to overcome this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour difficult." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound very foolishly as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing ever had changed; as though there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as borrowed optimist, I see quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the last few years we have seen suggestions for more transparency concerning the owners of companies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has gathered in central registers at a national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have submitted a draft bill in both parliamentarians, but this is not the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseudo-firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "" "" "we need managers in the economy who get up and say:" "" "" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need leading politicians recognizing the problem and campaigning to end this type of transparency through laws." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "together we can finally end the intransparency that now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after finishing my design studies, I made a sale of the backyard.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. after that, he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me enthusiastically how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "" "" "" "where are you sleeping tonight?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "" "" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "" "" "and I thought," "" "" "" "Oh, man!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I doing now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the corps of peace, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to be kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">That's a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "" "" "then I heard myself saying," "" "" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "" "" "a voice in my head said," "" "" "" "Please, as please?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what did I smash myself?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger is sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "" "" "what if he's crazy?" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, slept on toe tips at the door, and closed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not insane.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me today hangs in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it changed my perspective completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold as foreigners in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let us take a time leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate withdraws and the rent is raised.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something about it. our apartment will be a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ah! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so 'air mattress and breakfast' [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on the wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham omelettes were completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things were rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if this could be a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">This is how we presented investors: "we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "that will be the next big thing!" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody, who is still with comfort, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we, as children, have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can count on things that you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we strive for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone next to your left sitting room.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silky panicking of panic you now feel -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked cell of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only so, who actually has Al Gores cell phone now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce on Twitter that he is channeling for the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he tells us where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you have 150 appraisals that all say: "he can really hold out very well unlocked cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to hand over your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought out feedback system boosts confidence decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to submit negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their testimonies before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are in terms of age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Surprisingly, we trust the people most that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is a natural social bias." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="181">It becomes exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three judgements, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stifles similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you buy from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "" "" "if you say too little, like" "" "" "" "hi!" "" "" "", "you don't get an answer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "" "" "one talks about too much, for example:" "" "" "" "I have problems with my mother." "" "" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. "great works of art in your apartment! I'm doing holidays with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we design it with design to build this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to dismantle these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need not previously covered.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who did not allow parties to celebrate parties or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront, when faith was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the caller has been and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For men trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, miracles can emerge.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know one.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay goes off.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled on this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing coincide with monetary transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's about economic trading here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "" "" "but to name it simply" "" "" "" "rental industry" "" "" "", "the thing will not do justice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People leave a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel today, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic for it.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travel were a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place one visits, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub crawl neighborhood that you've never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would create apartments from the ground up for sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of sharing a share?</seg>
<seg id="238">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. lots of parking lots belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children had moved out. incubator programs were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">To be able to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be staying with a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as we were taught.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was hospitality even before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that amazingly,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this big influence, I wonder why we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the safety check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that the Americans think most of them would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim, it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I'm introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A carrot-fitness-fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga who sings, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I decided to oute myself.</seg>

<seg id="278">The funny thing was that at that time it was a feminist proclamation of independence, and the pressure I felt as 17-year-old was to adapt myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passively accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was confident and slow, deepening with every reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Have you ever had the feeling that someone you perceive, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves you?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">"" "" "" "I had a child later, after my marriage, and basically lived the" "" "" "" "Egyptian-American Dream" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that horrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking news."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical fault?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do something like this?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..." "... in the name of Islam..." "... Middle Eastern..."... "... Jihad..."... bombed Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It has not only been attacked by my country, but in the Nu the acts of others transformed me into a suspect.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start with the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as I drove silent -- as deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said, "Be alert," "Be careful," "Bleib in well lit areas," "Don't be ashamed."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day Muslims gather to pray.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "" "" "and again the warnings came:" "" "" "" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a destination." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people considered to be Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have put the anger of people on the terrorists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain oneself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I don't have any questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there are accusations that are hard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="320">Today, we can actually say people: "there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and include mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the US body.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know that a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumor in the United States, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques in America make America more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there may be some parking spaces, but don't stop the terror." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to the view of people of other faith tolerant and to show greater citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently said: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radicalization process, it has been found that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their families so that the extremists can do a brainwashing which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and their ideology is a traitor or disliked by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we have to stop people going to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves to their imaginations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam like the Ku Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "" "" "both groups claim their ideology in their" "" "" "" "holy book" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she wanted to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every minister with whom she spoke was silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that had made sense to her anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam restored the connection with God and His church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them of their anger, he showed their constructive way for real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affects our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows that when people submit messages in which negative about Muslims have been reported, they would rather agree on military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of American Muslim rights.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it can actually be a tool for tampering with the public in order to undermine the foundation of free society, which has rational and well informed citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We might feel it first, but the toxic air of fear hurts all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the allocation of collective debt it is not only about having to explain oneself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>

<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous man she knew.</seg>

<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, as it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat, we went silently, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I took it out, pulled off my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw let me stop." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had brought courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about becoming a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air package delivery penetrated into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France has built a six-metre-high tower of 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting flight devices, flight devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build resilient structures on your own.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence and generally react to laws of nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to function autonomously, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, an offshoot of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "" "" "external commands can be" "" "" "" "start" "" "" "" "and" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine that tries to beat two flies with one flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most startup helpers, it can float, and has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft does not matter in which position the optimal position is regained and the performance can be improved by practice.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that are at the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft, which had only two movable parts: one propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospiter, the mechanically most remotely controlled aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and rudder, no more actuators or control surfaces, just one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much so that it can fly steady, and can move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it doesn't have the elegant engine of the rear starters. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right when I'm all looking is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the moon is an exercise in pleasure, this machine is here, the Omnitelescope with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">This gives it the audacious ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned, or even how it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some are imaginable in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they need to be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propeller aircraft engines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller comes out, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly, albeit limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making half of it flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercially available micro-quadcopters -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. that is why there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine over there would like to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that creative, smart creations allow them to form in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes orbited each other faster and faster in a very distant galaxy, so they converted the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, they lit more brightly than all stars together in all galaxies of all of us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy did not set them free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">Finally we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into the space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events temporally.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, there arose a lot of celiac life on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the Earth has produced some things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is standing at us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which arise approximately through colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the Detector League: the laser interferomet- gravitational-wave-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following years, the precision of Ligo was significantly increased, which greatly improved recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, it is now called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 Ligo was started for a final test run to solve some small, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, just a few days after the detector was commissioned, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes flew through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">You walked through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the parting of my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been investigating gravitational waves of black holes and their signals from observatories such as Ligo. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational-wave is a convulsion in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When the wave is passed over, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and punched into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, lecturers often lead to a truly alpine dance in courses of relativity theory.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each one of us was stretched and breathed at the arrival of the waves. the stretching of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1. that's why the Ligo staff explained crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be accurately measured to less than a thousandth of the nucleus of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "" "" "described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, hunting for the waves in the following way:" "" "" "" "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott longs to say Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength far smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical because you can create an image or a map of things by perceiving the light coming around you from several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">It is different with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">This is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child, for example.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to focus on the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now, Alice is speaking." ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and Bob is interrupting her." "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">With them we cannot produce simple images of objects in space.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies lie in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just about: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">When the two bodies turn very fast, one hears the same pair of chirping with an additional key change. this sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget - Ligo heard the following: [Surrender noise] Somebody who knows what to hear, recognizes this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which turn around as quickly as the bars of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us take a closer look at what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves an entirely new way to research the universe, as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the unseen.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can't see -- practical or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiks explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes, however, happen in the core hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational-waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the Big Bang is obscured by its own enlightening.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact Ligo found things right in the first attempt of things that we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, such as Ligo watching, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the sauerkraut for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars, and ultimately also how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than to listen to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">You can dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I experimented with an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "" "" "for one year I would say," "" "" "" "Yes," "" "" "" "before whom I feared." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced "yes" to say.</seg>
<seg id="557">Would I speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I feared was getting rid of my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of holding speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply, on an unexpected way. it started with a question of my small ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all "kittens" for inexplicable reasons,</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "pussy, I need milk for my beak cup." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked her once if I could play with her when I was on the jump. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">"" "" "" "this" "" "" "" "yes"</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude towards life in my family. from then on, I bothered to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I am doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very proud.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" -saying to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I'm a writer. I think about things, stir you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dreamjob job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dreamjob job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I crave television. I am producing television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do television, in a great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">One new episode, every nine days, four shows, all nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts simultaneously in production, sometimes four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">$350 million for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series runs one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are programs that I have created myself, and not just produced, so still overhead. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that are burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else does that?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dreamjob job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I tell it because I know what you think if the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you are going to run a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously when I talk about work so you understand that I am not just lying around on the computer and imaginative, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not about dreams in a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am immersed in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as if you wear a high tone, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the sum.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A hum begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy street, I could go on it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I'm talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the totum -- when I started working and working and making, building, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this totum, this energy. the totum!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The totum is action and activity. the totum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The hum is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a humming, then you can no longer strive for size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of being no different than striving for size doesn't matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I just know I love the totals." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to say to you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to clarify one thing: the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more blurring boundaries, the more work there is, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more there are expectations.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon which I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the buzzing, the buzzing, the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this hum. I love the hum.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this hum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the totum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overloaded, overloaded, exaggerated, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The hum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is a single work institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "" "" "and Emerson says:" "" "" "" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the hum ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The engine's buzzing was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The hum did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzzing was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as usual: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no regrets, nothing delegiver, a Titan not sleeping, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no hum.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was stillness.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a flagship Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the swamp I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love, is suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "" "" "I know some may think:" "" "" "" "Heul made you stupid, stupid author Titan." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do, you do, you work, you love what you do, being a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the buzzing when you know the hum once you knew the humming, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "" "" "and then my" "" "" "" "southern" "" "" "" "waitress" "" "" "" "asks me a question." "" ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "" "" "I am on the way out, late and she says:" "" "" "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "" "" "she does not call anyone" "" "" "" "kittens" "" "" "". ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm a titanium and my humming shrank, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "" "" "and so she says:" "" "" "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "" "" "and I say," "" "" "" "Yes." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "" "" "we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "" "" "Everybody Poops." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the absence of the summons, I can do nothing but watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I created, the marathon which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, waxing pins and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl releases in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door enters and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not right away, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The money is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sum, but a sum.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the sums of work, the totals of titanium, this is just the substitute.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself with the aid of broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real totum is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The totum is no force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzzing is the stream that comes from the zest of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real totality is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real buzzing ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not up to me as to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what kind of person prefers to be at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>

<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">None of this is that I am too relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="731">We move around in the garden, before and after, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always grab my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totum of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! tell them yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you think me naive, for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">They have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talking my teenie daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>

<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready for bed.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my oasis of well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the totum, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very small ability for self healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who is trying to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly, they have one of the most well known ones, the "deep brain stimulation." in doing so, one electrodes a deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, suffering from violent tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">But neuromodulation does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time, I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain swells at the brain trauma and increases the intraocular pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the intraocular pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">To do this, you sometimes have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François managed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="825">That he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They parted slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They stem from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage, they care for the fold of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they keep us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however -- we got our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did to Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them color in order to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we introduced them to the collection point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- car transplant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimport these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimport the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we reimported the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely, as if they were removed again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and reimplantated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew into mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimplantated.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we colored in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we couldn't stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take pellets from one tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skill, we moved the motor skills area in the motoric cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the apes were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hands.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recuperate to a certain degree, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see, when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the maturation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that they were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to imitate her in man.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "" "" "Bruno Giussani:" "" "" "" "I am sure that even now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" "" "" "" "I know someone who can do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that's understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years will it take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority permit us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then it is necessary to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then it is necessary to apply this to a multicentre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a great mistake to consider them self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable entity.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics is completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistakably clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- could not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save democracy, but that we need a genuine and defensible democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are brighter, our future bleak and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "" "" "I call it the twin summit paradox." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A peak is known to you. you know and recognise it as the mountain of debt, which casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash that is part of the wealthy depositors and corporations, which are too fearful to invest where it would be productive and contribute money to the debt-mountain and also to produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, such as green energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in the United States, England and the eurozone, in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, railway tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 billion US dollars sounds after much money until one compares it with the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing except the stock markets to inflate and apply the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand which, as in a continuous loop, promotes the pessimism of investors, in which they do not invest.</seg>
<seg id="925">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "involuntarily, the circumstances cause the body to kill him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my quarrel with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His extremely wasteful art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally ended up too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "however, it would be a mistake to diminish the importance of the Athenian democracy due to these exclusions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision taken by the Athenian democracy was and is, that it involved the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which gave them the right to political co-determination with the same moods in questions of the state cheek.</seg>
<seg id="935">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Athenian democracy hasn't lasted long -- though --" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines brightly, it is burned out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies don't have roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately constituted a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy became possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, whereas the economy, i.e. the world of corporations, became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle took place between the two, by gradually undermining politics and deprived them of it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today it is possible to be in the government and yet not in power, because power has immigrated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my shark with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of predators that have decimated the animals they feed on, that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">The power of corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, the inequality rises, the macroeconomic demand falls and the managers of the corporations are too scared to invest in the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism expelled the "demos" from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy again, and it would be better if the "demos" keep control, just as in ancient Athens, aside from the expulsion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not particularly good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, wasteful and social conflicts lower, just as it -- very soon, as I think, will come in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we need to reunite the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and make sure we are democratizing the re-unified area, or else we end up in a pathological monitoring hypercar bureaucracy which lets the movie "Matrix" appear like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is therefore not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements he has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the "Matrix," or something similar to that of society in "Star Trek," in which machines serve humans and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long discussions the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" -similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you some examples shortly.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you are working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and from revenues and the concept of wage labour are completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those belonging to the companies but not working in it, and employees who work there, but which the company does not belong to. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no emerging twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy: please introduce yourself to the fact that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Keep in mind that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that these funds are invested in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "today we have them, especially against the background of a reunified policy and economy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe is at the same time liberal, in which they prefer privileged individuals, and Marxian because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage dump of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Luigi Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will generate such a massive downturn in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers referred to as a "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we are currently experiencing, it will destabilise not only our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant.</seg>
<seg id="986">As Hayek, therefore, I am a libertarian Marxist, and as Keynes, and therefore I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not confused, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers you said very clearly what you think of the West's point of view on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area, where most of it plays, is the sphere of economy -- a fully democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some ways, if I may say so provocative, China is today in resemblance to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">To present China now, to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells great for hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guessed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later in the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "namely to say good-bye to the self-complacency and the continual denial that a massive downturn in the eurozone proceeded and continues, which massively threatens the development of the whole European Union." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first suggestion that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">To do it right. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continued to choose denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to maintain an economic system that is not capable of surviving by political will and authoritarianism, you may be able to delay it for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destroyingly.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you anticipate?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone looking back -- serious...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister or any minister who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he claims he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders' side to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that wasn't.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring down our government, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that were running through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they had been going through a disastrous programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>

<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of talks, you seem to be still pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>

<seg id="1038">By Roy Price most of them have never heard before, although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an icon and describes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a highly competitive industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy doesn't have any choice.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right corner of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and above, it is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where after you have looked at a relay, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left hand side, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price doesn't worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to support "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the average bullet, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The print is there, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and, through an evaluation, chooses eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where everyone can watch them free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And when Amazon comes out for nothing, one attacks, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know they are being watched by watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team that record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You can record when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skips or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process it and from it comes the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a sitcom of four Republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that many people cannot remember this show because it wasn't so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked out.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of hosting a contest, he and his team looked at the available data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give to the shows, their history, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "" "" "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Now the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">There are two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this about?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic says somehow that this should work in all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as Back-Up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It optimizes it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work this way, it is a bit startling because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this space ever comes into contact with this software. come into contact with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the US and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company will be used to determine whether or not a discharge occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it can predict outbreaks of flu, the bad way through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year by year, until it suddenly no longer worked,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data from the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data streams into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use unimaginable lots of data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you basically do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem into its parts, so you can analyze the individual parts; as a two, put the individual parts together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces again even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, what else they wouldn't have been capable of. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards," that was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they took a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions first when they were competing for TV ideas, then they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "" "" "it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "" "" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start controlling our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and in order not to forget it, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before giving data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no-question, you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will post it later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I have made some decisions in my life, where I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, when you have the data available, you would like to replace them with a much wiser way, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not alter the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">In the end, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the huge amount of data, it is still paying off to make decisions, to be an expert in what one is doing, and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
