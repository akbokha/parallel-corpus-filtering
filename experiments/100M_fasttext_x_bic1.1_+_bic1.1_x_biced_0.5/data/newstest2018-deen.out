Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren institution , where young people are to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , where it is excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official card Munich promotes exciting stories .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this , because the Nav@@ i car instead of a b@@ ypass road showed a green meadow .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the state government , are far from topical , but very revealing .
especially when comparing them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of Munich &apos;s Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that you can &apos;t recognize as such .
more detailed maps , so @-@ called author fl@@ yers , were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities .
these were made according to the Bavarian sur@@ veying business between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
her client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon asked for an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops were finally pulled off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , they were the present @-@ day neighbours , who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern @-@ map .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV founded the project further , founded the Top@@ ographic Bureau - and thus the Bavarian State veying business .
the leaf@@ let for Munich dates back to the year 18@@ 56 and is , like all others , to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded in the Munich subur@@ b 21 years after the map was created , i.e. in 18@@ 77 .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings were concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a small @-@ scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand @-@ written numbered bat@@ ons from the so @-@ called &quot; premiere &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small plots there are no more farmers there - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land in the sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area lies north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , which has been the scene of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact a meadow - and no concrete jungle .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of the present @-@ day district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen one reads not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the rise &quot; Auf der Lü@@ nen &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Schul@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once locked people with ma@@ dness .
there , in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich @-@ based circle Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; Auf der aux Lü@@ ften &quot; was created .
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , related to the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time and ended , for example , the anchor of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohibited the personnel from applying force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution .
there was room for 280 patients , later it was extended to 500 seats .
at some point , this capacity was insufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar in 1905 .
the Is@@ ar Amp@@ er Hospital Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been located there since 2006 .
young people meet at the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um on the grounds of the former prison institution .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
West is the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in an architectural reference to the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt which was destroyed during the Second World War during bomb attacks .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; main square &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger street was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the inner city .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn St@@ range will take place .
with the slider you can compare the old Munich card with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Union for the Promotion of Far@@ ms has issued a warning for colorful people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is scheduled to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls on af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to take special attention when travelling by the state , as a number of du@@ bi@@ ous , rapid @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; says the group &apos;s opinion .
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i that makes people harder to win discrimination law@@ suits , as well as the state &apos;s prosecution authorities , who dispro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , prompted the group to release the warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights , which happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited occur@@ ren@@ ces such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the journey by the state and taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of crime .
the Council also points out a recent report from the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General in which it is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state will keep 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chapel said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready if they bring deposits or let relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report programme , which ranks the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the warning is also a response to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the States had passed immigration laws that oblig@@ ate local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which , according to the AC@@ L@@ U , will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately interest groups have acted as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Wei@@ de@@ z@@ aun@@ project is elementary
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ fence project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a successful project and will continue next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U members of the German Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac made a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U town@@ ship together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties met at the pi@@ vot@@ al cemetery of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first provided an insight into his operation , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative @-@ free marketing pathway for the milk of its cows , &quot; says Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este only region@@ ales .
as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V @-@ President of Fischer @-@ bach , he called the Wei@@ de@@ z@@ aun@@ Project as &quot; Ele@@ mental important . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot manage on such steep faces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grass@@ land area care for a lot of work , much needs to be worked with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and engaged it without chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ iser , even if it did not conduct a bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the pasture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is glad about the leaders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are farmers would have to be supported .
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the areas could be dra@@ gged down for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mayor pointed out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farmers are often critic@@ ised for funding because of funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven entran@@ ts .
the surface area is 40 hectares , which can not be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 Euros , half of them were promoted through leaders , a quarter carried the village of Fis@@ her@@ bach .
thus , the farmers remained 12,@@ 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of pasture fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac emphasized : &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and farmers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiss it stood firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here the best foods are produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg allows the state support of fence @-@ f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
the pre@@ condition is the presence of a convey@@ or@@ tage described by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the area to be fenced must not be tractor @-@ operated ( inclin@@ ation over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
for the fisher@@ man bacher Wei@@ de@@ z@@ aun@@ Project 2018 , the motion of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , who would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway .
the surface of the event corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing holy ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking up the Statue of Liberty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the careful down@@ fall of Saddam Hussein on the Fir@@ do square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the president &apos;s proposals for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller does not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have as@@ pi@@ red him if he had done it .
but it gr@@ asp@@ ed its importance , and in particular the importance attributed to it , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta said , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poem that you refer to is added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is obj@@ ectively correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your arms , and your afflicted masses who y@@ earn to breathe freely , and the miserable rub@@ b@@ ish of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable garbage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tru@@ mp USA are not welcome .
this conflict , because of the significance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about the significance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who campaig@@ ned to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took up a highly political action .
the sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn , traditional ima@@ gery .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus had changed the significance of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the Great W@@ rite R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is no one , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative one that brings the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not shine the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh came across something quite unusual here .
the significance of the statue is entirely a question of the viewpoint of perception .
Lazarus &apos;s great imagin@@ ative act was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible voy@@ ages on the decks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever want to recognize .
their torch is not meant to enligh@@ ten the way , but to ign@@ ite the hatred which is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the United Kingdom team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots were part of the UK team
the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship box will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special has been developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we figure it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ te - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team as team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ lie@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your Captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h made quite naturally were magnificent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in the fifth world championships in the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the central aisle runner Mu@@ ir takes on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m of runners .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which one should observe after a great season , which included the victory of the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle is reminded of her first world championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell team .
the team captain said that she is &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of her comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also with the med@@ als and the fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a big honor anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates had voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking cre@@ ators via Facebook : don &apos;t get a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the call @-@ up of voters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the father of our country knew something of bad press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he le@@ aped in cri@@ tique , for sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent , we are led like sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type like ho@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of people who come to the governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum called officially and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan spokes@@ woman A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing but a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post talked to some of the real guys that were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a pastor , not a troll@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ited .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the comment section of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I do not appreciate this idea , even if a number of people take a stand on the same subject , then they are dis@@ regarded by some as a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what the govern@@ ors referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous times , if you had done the same , that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical roles or to arrest and silence the demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what is happening digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tru@@ mp is su@@ cked by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question came last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ ent@@ u@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters beat on his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , who critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Great Britain , overwhel@@ med his office according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance Club
the former European No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comforts in the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an holds the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led last year in the ar@@ cher@@ y left to the final before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry made a great job when he laid down this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time even though he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that really feels particularly good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open as it was taken out of the programme in the year after I had won it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the action on home soil .
this event will be his first Scottish show since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad how things went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

fewer lung cancer patients with passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
researchers at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) are coming to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths per year are attributed to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said head of study Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he approached his own study on this subject from 1994 .
back then there were 400 pulmon@@ ary cancer cases due to passive smoking in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ ingen road are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; says the manager of the courtyard Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .
the traffic , which always hin@@ ders the construction work , represents a major problem for the building activities of St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and shut @-@ off doors is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road is closed and only the scheduled buses are entitled to pass through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days have been very exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fortunately , we were looked after by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian golden country
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the un@@ quiet Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually den@@ otes a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a , &quot; directly in the chim@@ ney .
after half an hour , the carb@@ oni@@ zed tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. washing clothes with clou@@ dy water from nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous to work late : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5@@ pm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote by a public raise in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement that stir@@ red up the independence of Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 the province was officially split in Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprised the eastern part of the island .
the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rented car .
there is no public transport .
the city of about 19@@ .000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corrugated sheets , which have been transformed into different yellow @-@ brown tones by rust .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ an honored a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , their dark shirt and their bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we used to have leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s golden country .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port de@@ compos@@ es gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , the export of wood resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua that ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port &apos;s local military units and units paid nearly $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to one single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ an aspir@@ ations for greater autonomy threaten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indon@@ esian army since 1969 .
massac@@ res in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 &quot; s were genocide in accordance with the Asia Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; we Are Get@@ ting All &quot; is called in a report from the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric sho@@ cks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since incidents happen every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the bolts have reinforced , as Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ping cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetable served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , who moved to the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native Papua ( the mother m@@ um &#91; the women &#93; from Papua ) cost their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of rights in Papua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai ) on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but little has changed in Papua , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that it will satisfy our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ov &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire at En@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch off their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers ki@@ cked their tone and later returned to four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ on , was struck so severely that he fell into a coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young soldiers , women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and performed the Wa@@ ita dance - im@@ itating in circles and a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters started throwing stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses are resist@@ ing more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official TI@@ ME document that was not released by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colourful wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and tried his body to make sure he was there , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who , like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I knew him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station only because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; said spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more wounded .
the news of the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; by Jak@@ arta .
in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , Jok@@ ow@@ i was talking to J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura for three weeks in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and bo@@ thered to attack the historic gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
security minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he made an out @-@ of @-@ court mechanism for sett@@ ling historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 @-@ s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we are committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on June 5 in Jak@@ arta , saying that he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to , who charged the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; demanding more than 1,000 lives in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum , said that 11 cases of violations of human rights have already been settled in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such alle@@ gations with gri@@ m un@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus reiter@@ ated the view that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings did not stop .
on Tuesday , the Indon@@ esian police shot villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a building company that refused to bring a unconscious husband to hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , who was 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Bri@@ gade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting down and killed one .
&quot; we were in panic , we &apos;re afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the wounded had been delivered here quickly , &quot; says the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden myself in my house two days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon the officers to take account of the police and withdraw the police bri@@ gade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a resting point for the Indon@@ esian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal family Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua New Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by firing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indon@@ esian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , in recent years thousands of people have been arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never dive again .
among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty allevi@@ ates dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit of rice sold in an inf@@ ra @-@ red ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is out of reach as well .
people here build everything they eat : primarily Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of the women who can handle four or five fields of the sweet potato each .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ il airport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ thier migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua people rarely have the capital or the necessary skills in order to compete with their own companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , president of the tribal committee of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on the reporting of international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov &apos;s campaign to raise the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Papua and West pap@@ ua : visa denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua ( including the Pan@@ i@@ ai firing ) .
historically , the same countries have supported the O@@ PM .
the speaker of the Indon@@ esian Foreign Ministry , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ha@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the alle@@ gations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights attacks . &quot;
the local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua claim that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Tribal Council .
he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , are in poor educational and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; he must pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai gun@@ shot have taken up a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried in one area just opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps justice will never come to them , but at least they will not forget their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire captured the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; Sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest dwell@@ ings in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to escape from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre @-@ high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second brand , which , in only two years , swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise , which is coinci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and when people scre@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can resur@@ rec@@ t questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rises all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the gate building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage from facing , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation , came .
in the UK , the police said she believed that the system of plates for the isolation and disgu@@ ise at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Club ( IT@@ F ) has passed through with his large Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the session in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the revolutionary proposal for this sport was to play Davis Cup sole only on two winning sets , thin @-@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
these often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ set classics thus remain the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only narrow@@ ly missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the applications .
after many contradictions even before the vote , the proposal had already come to bear the final in a neutral place .
new from 2018 on only comparatively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host @-@ right in the first round in the first round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in training stations etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete fewer official media appointments prior to the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden objects to the plane , find a survey
a survey among air passengers showed that more than 20 percent of items were consciously or un@@ consciously smu@@ g@@ gled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which entered the plane while they acci@@ dently carried banned knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent said they were late discovered that they had mistakenly gone with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service , Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travellers were more likely to ignore the rules .
of those sur@@ vey@@ ed who have know@@ ingly attempted to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent were millenni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X .
the most common items that were intentionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent said to have know@@ ingly worn items with blades by security control while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents affir@@ med that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the plane .
the company said it questioned travellers all over the country to find out how many accidentally brought smu@@ g@@ gling goods by airport security and how many would have done it deliberately .
it is no surprise that people who are the most likely smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry the safety of those who fly the most .
however , the company suggests that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uncertain what liquids they may take with you or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest number of objects confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a while the people thought that T@@ SA could view books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel orders
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k willingly accepts with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la model &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
in doing so , he has so far inter@@ cep@@ ted that a part of the customer has already re@@ trac@@ ted their non @-@ binding reservations .
alongside the ever @-@ triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k , at the announcement of the latest quarterly balance sheet , has betra@@ yed another , less gl@@ itter@@ ing figure for the first time : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in the past few months , Mus@@ k frequently had the more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins .
now Mus@@ k is dre@@ aming : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3,000 had already been withdrawn again .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely back .
at present 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem so far .
his argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
2018 - all models will be taken together - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1,@@ 800 bookings per day .
if you order a Model 3 , you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new , never @-@ tested production lines with maximum capacity utilisation without any major interrup@@ tions .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
if delays occur , then the liability of the reservations might become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ cont@@ ented customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA Chairman P@@ ru@@ itt goes back on account of dela@@ ying the Obama @-@ Er@@ a &apos;s rules to reduce emissions
a day after he was su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the environmental protection authority , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce the emissions of smoke @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes that his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit brought against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
this deadline exp@@ ires on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 o@@ zone standards .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay compliance with a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before being appointed by President Donald Tru@@ mp , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been forced to block or delay regulations aimed at preventing or dela@@ ying the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ pp regulatory rolling back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane le@@ aks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards would simply reinforce the willingness of EPA to co @-@ operate with states due to the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to meet deadlines for implementation and then wait to set up the deadline for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in its previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the EPA statement said that at some point , P@@ ru@@ itt will use its &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive reform of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measure has not yet been set up in the Senate .
the New York Public Prosecutor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States that had accused the EPA this week , said the Group intends to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our law@@ suits - is an important gain in the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man .
new York joined in this case California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont , Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year can contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ ly &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for protecting the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to address environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ ble celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery site in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 at 4 : 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ ficent Ser@@ en@@ ade can be char@@ med by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made Tum@@ bl@@ Line friends and sponsors a concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische forgiven : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ ble , including Vo@@ g@@ t@@ ei , to Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wording of the certificate , on the tum@@ ble mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a magnificent courtyard , to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age belonged and not vice versa .
so there were people there too .
as from the description of the district of Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the magnificent population centre of the village .
old maps from the period around 1600 under@@ score these historical facts .
the pat@@ ron@@ age law arose from the early medieval church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church , ref@@ unded and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
connected with this was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two sh@@ atter on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly @-@ created bell then rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed out later during the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 , French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and the church seats and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left standing .
during the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 , a storm broke out the church tower and half of it collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the present tower of Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ ell@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius system by Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
the organisers invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ arc on Sunday , July 16 , for the sixth seren@@ ade to the old cemetery for the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler Gramm@@ ar Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local leader Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 .
admission is from 3 : 30 PM .
at the end of the ser@@ en@@ ade , a drink takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view across meadows to the forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the organizers provide fantastic views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is of importance for Tum@@ ble and Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tum@@ bl@@ Line friends and sponsors feel particularly committed to home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ med . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
association wants to have permission for wind turbines to be checked
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirement for construction and therefore has turned to the council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; has called on District Coun@@ cill@@ or Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind force concentration zone existed at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
in this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are possible in principle , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
such zones are intended to prevent &quot; par@@ ra@@ ction &quot; of the landscape .
although the city Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved , because of a form failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the approved allowance is still un@@ lawful and therefore also take back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes it possible to grant permission for the construction of wind turbines on schedule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the circle confirms the receipt of the call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been received by the circle of Vier@@ sen for past weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it as an opportunity to re@@ consider the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a new subsidiary of the NEW , plans the construction of four wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the town Vier@@ sen particip@@ ates indirectly , had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered - this corresponds to around one @-@ fifth of the power demand of all four @-@ se@@ ater households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer Vier@@ sen &apos;s city coun@@ cill@@ or gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Kreis Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ ried Men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two more people were injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
according to police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car drove the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person .
city and retailer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region will re@@ discover shopping in the city centre .
the trade association and the municipal administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to l@@ ure the inhabitants of shopping in the city centre .
as the president of the Gewerbe@@ verein , Christian König announced , the &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ y &quot; weekend is to sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers for the offers that offer their own city away from the usual supermarket product .
a market with regional suppliers is therefore planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their apprentices@@ hips .
in addition , the shops of the city centre are supposed to invite you to &quot; midnight shopping . &quot;
in doing so , the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the region .
in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , says Christian King .
the Municipal Administration and the Trade Union cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus the trade association and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot;
this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well @-@ established Sunday , talks with all industrial advertis@@ ers and hosts , in order to move them to active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on that day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials are to be re @-@ developed or re @-@ developed .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many local people would have lost the city center while shopping .
in the end , all of them would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the city centre - up to the land@@ lords , the businesses of the whole city and clubs .
in the spring , it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that was partly wide @-@ spread .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that Germany &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities , will take part .
next to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day should promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and its many partners makes it clear that every citizen with his purchase behaviour can influence his direct surroundings .

Tru@@ mp launched a secured tran@@ scription of telephone calls in Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 27 January , Tru@@ mp called on a phone call with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border .
the US president insi@@ sted because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to him , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
the tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was given by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; that is the most unpleasant phone call for the whole day . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury performed through a group of spectators in the Mon@@ ro@@ e countryside , Georgia , and shr@@ ank to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car that had four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge , a group of white men stood out with guns to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle @-@ aged man in a pin@@ stri@@ ped suit - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside , the occup@@ ants ho@@ ver@@ ed in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man laugh@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of your car ! &quot;
cries broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only a reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if a loop around the neck of Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost all the people in the audience had a real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 civi@@ liz@@ ers return to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were as@@ yn@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was accused of murder .
&quot; it &apos;s really incredible that in all these years there was not a single person arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organising the after@@ math .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a dirt spot on a story , but it &apos;s a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ sman of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil right .
it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court doctor lays a blanket over the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI records received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching process .
but no one was ever accused .
although susp@@ ects remain on the loose for decades , citizens say that twice the motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black people to vote in Georgia for the first time in the election campaign in the summer .
about at the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com says a white landlord , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , says the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they removed from prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and arranged the mur@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also apparent that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution which was not only involved in mur@@ ders , removing evidence and conce@@ aling the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a right @-@ wing massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you let yourself register and if you vote , this will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual review of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their depic@@ tion is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is rooted in a kind of deep racism , many of whom want to believe that it no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ ching because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in us all , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t set up a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest bl@@ acks - came into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
he has played the role of Chief @-@ clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ w Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cher , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the ester scre@@ ams and presses him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He is blown away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cher .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s --- he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship super@@ se@@ des the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins once again .
this time when the N says the N word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition is violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed in mour@@ ning , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays , mour@@ ning praise for &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen viewers s@@ me@@ ars sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity for nearly eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly .
when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the dead bodies .
children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the quiet body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mut@@ tered a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thank@@ ed the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw the ly@@ n@@ ch rope away and wipe their tears off .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cher embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you did it for one reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience will sit together with the actors for dinner .
at one table a white pair of Atlanta talked about the pos@@ ing with a black pair they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find out what feelings the performance had left behind .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like yourself and do that because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ching continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called police shoot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone breaks Broo@@ ks &apos;s court at his table , he eats and recalls the civil rights .
he said he had already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is in a sense inspiring , for it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own history who doesn &apos;t know his own history is sentenced to repeat it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ conc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf will set up a colorful , fri@@ vol@@ ous setting in front of a gigantic six @-@ story backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows you either a sh@@ ab@@ by corner of the wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ stan@@ e &quot; logo of the G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
in front of it , an open Mercedes classic car park , in which the Rhine mur@@ der@@ ers pose as Rock@@ ergi@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - which is moving through his &quot; Ring &quot; production .
the three Rhine sentences - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise beautifully as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
cess follows Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) into the trunk of the trunk in Hollywood @-@ man@@ ners and give the Kra@@ ff@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the wonderfully fi@@ que hair that surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ ashed Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still has to believe in it .
the audience thank@@ ed the ensemble with thunder@@ ous applause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are being che@@ ered at a stor@@ my time , who mo@@ dest@@ ly bend their hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in light of the great heat again in casual leisure jackets .
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team was eag@@ erly anticipated .
in 2013 he had to leave the violin concer@@ to , five years later , in which the occasional &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; cries went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is expected to have rejo@@ iced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one notices that the audience has somehow grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it has also grown to an understanding of its perspective .
I draw a positive summary .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture stock , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture @-@ bridge .
and I also worked at school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are 26 years now , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come about ?
quantity : I did a high @-@ school diploma .
and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
do a social year , there is an insight , you can see how it is on the spot , in the focus perhaps also , really is .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will start my studies in social education in the winter semester . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am going to study dual studies , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and studying at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where you make your FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
different from studying civil engineering ?
quantity : well , here it is not about to calculate extras .
there are always other people in front of the head , each having a different story behind them .
whether a refugee or an adol@@ escent who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I am not the type .
it is an area that gives a lot .
much love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .
Pear@@ son cuts additional 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut down its intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure with which the company is facing .
in addition to its previous restructuring , the job cuts , which the General Director John Fall@@ on announced in the end of 2018 and early 2019 , will in addition to his previous restructuring , in which 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
Pear@@ son announced in May a third cost reduction programme to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its participation in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year remained unchanged , after an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack killed by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed at suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , Afghanistan , killing a soldier of Nato and viol@@ ating several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured and declared a NATO Declaration .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the incident in the Q@@ Ara@@ gon district .
bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has taken this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a NATO statement , it is said that the explosion on Thursday night was to happen when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by an impro@@ vised explosive device carried out by people . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ Ara@@ d is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had run this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ b@@ ings in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest military attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops pushed Taliban out of power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering increasing the number of U.S. forces supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies and , in particular , in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .

the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; O@@ zone Pro@@ visions 2015 , &quot; and said it shows the commitment of the Agency to cooperate with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the EPA &apos;s intention to quanti@@ fy the o@@ zone regulations in which a part of the country should measure pollut@@ ant emissions in order to determine where inc@@ isions have to be made to delay stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to back up a broad range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that according to Tru@@ mp is meant to boost economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the efforts have spark@@ ed the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air , o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce the lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for example , asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
community council wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ x @-@ Win@@ amp decides to set up a common room in the future retirement home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing plot has been signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although it will still take some time until the church community has so far belonged to the community , there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be implemented by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - some 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square metres floor space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council prefer not to fores@@ ee such a common room as a meeting point for residents of the sen@@ iors just , but openly into the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn by funding opportunities .
the building is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be , as reported , T@@ j@@ ades , eligible for 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposed resolution is to signal the investor that in this respect it is not necessary to throw a bil@@ l@@ board between the legs , the statement that both the saddle - which is le@@ aning against the ambient conditions - as well as a pul@@ pit roof - which would reduce the height and make the construction more economical - would be possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; need@@ less to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wil@@ fried sole &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means this addition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it helps , he passes the panel unanim@@ ously .
it &apos;s not as easy as the common room .
Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings that you can &apos;t go forward so well , but now you lean into the common room from the window , she says : &quot; I am very hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is definitely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against municipal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface there is no surplus , but receives a real counterpart , which is market@@ able in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s proposal to draw up the proposed resolution finds three advoc@@ ates .
so it remains with two opposing voices in the original program Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ari@@ zes : &quot; if we take the decision in such a way , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision by car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and severely injured .
as the police informed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling with his bike on the bicycle path of the road Schwar@@ zer Road out of direction Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder went to the road , he apparently did not pay attention to the on@@ coming traffic .
he met with a car that controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown on the street .
he suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ching car .
FC Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce the Super@@ cup at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
FC Bayern is travelling to Dortmund for the first time in the new season with personnel care .
seven professionals are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
the staff@@ s of the German football record champion Bavaria Munich are getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Cup winner Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti won &apos;t have to give up with the B@@ V@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
in addition , the mou@@ ths of Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has bl@@ amed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his crew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in a performance increase in the first official compulsory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights captiv@@ ates the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
in the resin from the star to the star
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ base &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created in the resin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the Astronom@@ ical Observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is coming to meet the needs of many visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it unites nature , science , movement and athletic performance .
members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inqu@@ ire St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the tablets is to be completed by the internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the star path Ticket to Ride will be extended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example , about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars might have different colors or why a star is more enlightened than another although it is considerably farther away .
also , in which con@@ stellation a selected star is found and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating the highest located observ@@ atory in northern Germany since 2014 in the town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , in the university town , there has been something similar to the planned star@@ base - the planet path since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting in front of Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path leads us up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden , with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ a@@ es with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to which were degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf Planet - are set exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the Earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun , which is exactly 75 metres away , still measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometres .
while the light takes about eight hours from the sun to the Plu@@ to , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star , however , would last for half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a potential show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were in a collision course to stage the most exciting fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ slept World Bo@@ xing Council weight champion , went down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super Feder@@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision about the former four @-@ division world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you a lot of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ac@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ac@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is cli@@ mates noticed that a show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down to light weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he must move on lightweight wheels &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s what the fans ask .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ac@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound dé@@ but this year to schedule a date next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) which also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light @-@ weight title fight in the forum on September 23rd .
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked for it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later expressed himself openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he like Lom@@ ac@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ac@@ enko held his generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the triple fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to co @-@ be . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that the focus was to show impact , then boxes .
both said they could sense the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ac@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters , and that is Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injured according to a tyre compound
in the event of an accident on the A@@ 7 , four persons were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a was likely to lose control of his vehicle at 16.@@ 30 in front of the end of the market .
the car sli@@ pped to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it over@@ turned and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was closed in the direction north for approximately one hour , then the traffic on the left lane was passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; the triple chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 at the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that the optimization of the defensive formation in Au@@ e scores points .
with the first round of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result as well , would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much and we must fit better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una Düsseldorf &apos;s defensive player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the triple chain is to be further optimised .
and a gate after a free@@ wheel does not want to capture the For@@ tun@@ as any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future there will be no one besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better able to cope better with the triple chain than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el says , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we have players in the tr@@ uss in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we can &apos;t afford so many play@@ things in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann will go to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can speak after a draw from a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could well be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we stand at four points on Sunday and can focus on the trop@@ hi@@ es , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; I judge the start in the season only after six to eight season days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk to Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a storm .
&quot; now they can start the season almost with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , believes that the players from Au@@ e might even be somewhat fres@@ her , since they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a Ascension favorite in the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know as 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the interior def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true that the visitors from the Rhin@@ eland serve as a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we sweep them away , just because we claim to be among the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose record is quite positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which you must hit from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declares For@@ tun@@ as &apos;s chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ old application tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . however , not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started carrying out tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they are said to make the assessment of age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Department ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critici@@ zed for the app@@ rais@@ al of the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
up to now , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 tests and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person &quot; may be 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are carried out only in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , results have been consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases the person has been judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the paper examined Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det the 5@@ 81 published results , she found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , in the x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work encompasses the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see if they usually went through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later than usual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; generally speaking , you can say that the risk of developing a child as an adult is low .
the greatest risk is that if the person is under 18 , this is about 10 per cent . &quot;
full in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is proceeding well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going super , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the Department of Road Construction and Traffic in the Pres@@ i@@ dency of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three renovation needed bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end of the project is scheduled for October and it is clear that the schedule will be met . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete that is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has come into the years .
to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning got a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a border for@@ tification , which is also used as an operating road .
a 2,@@ 20 @-@ metre wide bridge board is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way will take place .
the special thing is that it is fabricated parts , a patent for the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps .
the laying of pipes through the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach required a special sense of t@@ act .
there is also a fibre cable to which many companies are connected .
in the run @-@ up to the work , the residents were informed of the project by hand@@ outs .
fish and cru@@ stac@@ e@@ ans had to be f@@ ished at first .
for the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting point in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road is completely closed in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot;
the cost of the three bridge renov@@ ations is 700@@ ,000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties are pulling together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the circle of circles ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance , which shows a peaceful flag on this day , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle invites R@@ ond@@ ell to &quot; big campaign launch &quot; according to the poster .
and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land make the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k .
but those who are on site before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern , but to demonstrate .
the motto : &quot; Ei@@ fel stays colorful . &quot;
originally the city pick@@ nick was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well square , but now takes place in the parking below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that presents itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the Forum A World and one of the relevant organizers , is really pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is music and a lot of food , including an &quot; German potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him along .
the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it also shows presence at the station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D really come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D volcano Ei@@ fel says he has been trying to get such an event and get the supplement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf called for the first time in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because there were not enough parking spaces available due to the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also does : at 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz square , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen Af@@ D @-@ chair@@ Uwe Young .
there are about 200 listeners in the hall that wait for the top candidate for the election of the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to talk about their speeches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D @-@ event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can get back - no special occur@@ ren@@ ces .
trumpet meets trumpet
a meeting with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli will be present in the Has@@ lag Monastery group tomorrow , Sunday at 8@@ pm in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trumpet player Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in top European orchest@@ ras .
he is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli .
both combine the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to blend the boundaries of different genres .
this is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free playing become a fascinating total artwork .
this piece of the programme was premi@@ ered this spring with great success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : Has@@ lach &apos;s monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart speaks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it to the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart spoke openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparently most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt bitter@@ ly .
despite all this , the b@@ rün@@ ette protagon@@ ist ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with everyone I hated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I had played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed du@@ alism .
so it never interfer@@ ed or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never really liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she especially suffered from &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in school , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think of myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public do not like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to enjoy yourself in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me as ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening with President Tru@@ mp that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will say to you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a coach , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised previously a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not approve the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes finds that he has coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
meanwhile , on Thursday evening the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said , &quot; The party change from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which would rather prevent us from working to make our country look great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said R@@ NC chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in a statement to C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ologies for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader in athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included again in the sport .
Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships that the ban@@ ishing of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the athletes , who had won gold and silver med@@ als in competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress approved the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 following a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) pointing to state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to the re@@ porter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized for itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the Task Force recommendations that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the cor@@ rupted system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that commen@@ ce on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF task force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia needs to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ adjustment .
drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers still work freely , he told re@@ porters in London after a talk at IA@@ AF Council .
soldiers cut down for Mali
at a funeral service in the North Hes@@ sian Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers lost in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements .
Minister of Defense Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the un@@ explained cause of the crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she described the two inver@@ ted pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to the highest sacrifice they have done in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old stab@@ le@@ man from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week in West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and brought to the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter on Thursday .
at noon , only the relatives in the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service started in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the mour@@ n@@ most laid down roses , the relatives stood arm in arms on the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of Le@@ yen described the in@@ verse soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sat@@ anic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ erh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the flying operation of the combat helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if the crew could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubt about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of Le@@ yen said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The use is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated from only two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral ceremony , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want to grave near his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife .
this shared the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple are buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s cathedral church .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen had agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , and she continued to inform her .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
in 2016 he retired and also presents the title &quot; Prin@@ c@@ ée . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not consider himself equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the spokes@@ woman of the Danish royal house , declared .
it is unclear where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , he was born in Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ tra@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble family .
on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Danish was stag@@ gering , I preferred wine instead of beer , sil@@ ken sm@@ ur@@ fs instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had a reputation in this country to be the brand of social @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of a possible majority in Lower Saxony
according to Lower Saxony &apos;s prime minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the country , he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday , the resolution of the parliament was pronounced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in Lower Saxony had precip@@ itated the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a severe crisis earlier .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one @-@ voices majority in the parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants his faction to recommend it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with that CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be regularly voted on January 14 , 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l believes that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state Constitution also sees the possibility that the country &apos;s day draws trust and elect a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these opportunities must be thoroughly tested , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all the questions in peace if they are judi@@ ci@@ ously tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called the sister &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself emphasized : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of Black @-@ Green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the back@@ sli@@ dden de@@ pu@@ ties to return their land trade .
&quot; we , of course , assume that , with immediate effect on their land convention , which they received over the green country list , the president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner shared with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we greatly regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consciously decided not to pron@@ ounce pron@@ unci@@ ation in the faction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty In@@ tri@@ gen@@ spiel and tries to make political capital from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany discusses inf@@ ested eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal come about ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) talks to Germany ( R@@ ND ) in an interview with the editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ caf@@ et@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states present the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if according to everything we currently know , a health endanger@@ ment is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier isn &apos;t really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has stopped immediately and since the announcement of the sad@@ ness of Germany in close contact with the authorities of the countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all information and risk evaluation are available to consumers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
retailers , as well as producers , have to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual value of eggs exceeds 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , they are not market@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time the farms are not to blame .
do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
in accordance with the current state of knowledge , the production plants do not meet any direct fault .
on the contrary , due to alleged illegal practices of service companies , they have to reck@@ on with economic damages .
as always there are too few inspec@@ tors in the case of serious cases .
is it only lacking in the staff or in the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
it is also true that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out by 100 percent .
precisely because of this , consistent education of such events and hand@@ ing over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences may be present are of crucial importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular alarm mixing really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have the right to only get safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are entitled to rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the pan@@ de@@ mic agent , manufacturers , distributors and consumers are caught up in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ borne animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
this must be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect all relevant authorities to prompt the facts promptly and without gaps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the Fis@@ cal Rules of the football match N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mo@@ ving to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded spending on European football clubs are not bo@@ thered by N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from entering the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules established in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G will eventually prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to exp@@ el the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make money easy for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring it to a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the power @-@ rich marsh@@ al family of Qatar .
clubs may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but have to interact with legitimate revenue sources that allow them to point the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini for his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - purchased a club with potential and then invested heavily in improving the team and building a global brand - should become a harder matter .
during the current tri@@ enni@@ al FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amoun@@ ting to EUR 30 million .
even though Plat@@ ini has fallen from the presidential election in 2015 , his successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to sc@@ are away from excessive expenses .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , against The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a l@@ ump sum , it may distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the sales revenues for the next five years can be recorded in the annual financial statements of 4@@ 4.4 million euros .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has met the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues from companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Qatar company could sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing was to exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not allow this to be considered to be legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could be made by payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 denied that N@@ ey@@ mar W@@ WM ambass@@ adors are being sent and that such manoeu@@ v@@ res for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators might be easy to figure out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
accounts for the last financial year still need to be published .
PS@@ G anticip@@ ates that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s passing by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last owner to PS@@ G .
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play because one can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new shock supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation stands before a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the order .
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; of Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very happy with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
around 17 million small red @-@ white packed sho@@ cks of 14 grams distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants every year before landing to the passengers .
Swiss didn &apos;t want to give any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ der appreci@@ ates the volume of orders in &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary generates annual sales of approximately 1 billion Swiss francs .
but even more important is the advertising effect : for a shock manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
Swiss Life does not want to disclose how many applicants are involved in the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers are eligible .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y hopes to rev@@ ise the agreement on spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement .
Swiss Life has been distributing chocolate bars on board their flights since 2006 .
before the Swiss made a contract with Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss made it possible to place the logo at the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y two and a half years ago .
the airline is co@@ operating with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , First Class customers are spo@@ ilt by the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , Business Class sco@@ ot@@ ers Scho@@ gg@@ i from Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
on the short circuit , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is also distributing Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ er @-@ years Gr@@ unge era ( as the pioneer David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for itself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd were going to bigger things .
as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; surprisingly worked well , not only because of his absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a promising ose vegetables , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by graf@@ ting on the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children who will grow up - but still manage to win back the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his grown @-@ ups who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the casting wheel principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &quot; s such as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand Pi@@ cked the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
at one point , a character bum@@ ps through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ malign@@ ant plot , included in Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ on &apos;s whis@@ kers from &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
these are the moments of random ma@@ dness that could fuel this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band how to visit the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now re@@ members a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with his East versus West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography .
the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka is to be a bound TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic i@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues are du@@ bbed by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice days to look at ( the police sp@@ ends time watching chess on TV as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask - that it often plays like a single .
with six long episodes , the comedy ensu@@ es , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; which was edited down to a lower length could better deliver its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef are constantly re@@ visiting the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men , who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food for a purpose .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs .
strike against drug ma@@ fia in the country
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have hit the Italian Ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office Con@@ stance reported on Friday .
15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , officials ordered large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
during the same ra@@ ids in Italy two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two are therefore likely to be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian explor@@ ers participated in the action .
a total of over 300 polic@@ emen were in operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised crime , violent acts of violence , attempted murder and rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office established Con@@ stance against organised drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo , an active exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large @-@ scale operation was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the investigations were aimed primarily at Italian nationals with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the gang &apos;s account .
Weise Uz@@ be@@ k large gaps in the for@@ eigner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreign register in Germany shows considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to partly serious wrong decisions in the case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the representative for the refugee management of the German government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the ali@@ ens central register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short@@ com@@ ings in the data recorded there may lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partly serious wrong decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to figures , ten million people with foreign nationality are registered in the register , among them 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore administered by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
because the data had not been sufficiently well maintained , the quality of data in parts has not been good .
in some cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register any more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faulty data input can slow down revers@@ al processes considerably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also ens@@ hr@@ ined , who would not have to leave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such false attri@@ butions , however , lead to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient tax@@ pa@@ yers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families back to Italy under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children once they have entered the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the paper it is said that the BA@@ MF will perform such procedures &quot; regarding families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper referred to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement it is responsible for refugees from the EU state they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant continues to travel to another EU country , this state can return it to the country of entry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ t@@ HR ) considers these commitments sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threaten un@@ lawful shooting conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
in a total of 220 litres of blood of persons living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach the blood donation service was already available to other people .
at least of the twelve citizens awarded on Friday .
especially Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who with his 100 donations now has 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation recognizes multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; it is awesome how our bodies are designed for it and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner .
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the Regional Director of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the c@@ anned foods are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents .
for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reports about the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K district care manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
already before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a took the beer to the multi @-@ unit don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations .

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members striving to increase this month as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment .
in its quarterly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budget@@ ary income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .
but she sign@@ aled that in the next few years , interest rate increases would be necessary to raise the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that the cost of bor@@ rowing might have to rise more than expected at the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth economic package published a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it has been said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot;
at the interest rates it repeated that &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary to cool inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; extent than markets expect .
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank emphasized that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this year and next year will be 1.9 % and 1.7 % for the next year .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations for the interest rate increase and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the Bank at the end of the year .
the latest inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households concerned with rising inflation and minor salary increases , as the intensi@@ fication gets worse first before it gets better .
she added that monetary policy in the coming years could not &quot; prevent &quot; the income break , &quot; but she added that wages to the end of her three @-@ year forecast are &quot; clearly &quot; re@@ covering .
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the collapse of the pound .
the bank estimates that it will probably take four years until it will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s last judgment on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July .
inflation last month dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said this was expected and will be put on again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the transgres@@ sion in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as the len@@ ders are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with due @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) should prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in front of the High Court against the funding of the drug in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which may reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by the health service through a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the alle@@ gation that the local authorities should fund it .
the move announced on Thursday was greeted by N@@ HS England boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ p pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a consequence of HIV agents that are taken prior to sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in risk of infection .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who question the treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics we identify suitable candidates who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living in England and registered by a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will sign £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive purchase .
the study aims to evaluate the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence as used on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this grand new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in cop@@ ing with one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if directed specifically to people in need and endangered , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September on people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is genu@@ inely controlled and not subject to negotiations with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority now must be that the study will be conducted quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine has been obtained , we are on the way to protecting more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and delayed implementation by the government .
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study will be conducted as soon as possible across the country to protect people infected with HIV and that they will contribute to a step closer to the termination of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , moved from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne tells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room estate with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne closet space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was my request , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , she commissioned the Archit@@ ec@@ tural and Design@@ studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel works are quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with plenty of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
a short corridor is mirr@@ ored at both ends to allow it to work for longer .
in the kitchen , the reflection feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
by perc@@ ei@@ ving a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is mutual so that when you push the door , it is very easy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxury advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself by good design and increased square met@@ rics of something standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you might decide to not leave them .
brothers fight for 500 million US dollars real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in an exploration of one of the largest real estate imperial Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how her property and business assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp controversy over the separation will take place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have acquired 38 real estate in the value of more than half a billion dollars , since the family bought a store in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew up in a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and De LU@@ TI@@ S &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the Stad@@ tz@@ en@@ rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
following an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - by Paul as the &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - has about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court record says that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the allocation of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the det@@ ach@@ ments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now also struggle to control the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to in@@ compet@@ ently manage some possessions .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases in the case of hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and two parties held law firms .
Ms. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen in the late 1950s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , where Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ an@@ das of the family .
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of High School when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property on to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group of companies , wherein Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million in leaving the company and hat@@ ch 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the terms of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has with@@ drew very much , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the board and after a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much &quot; because the case is in front of the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to su@@ e me and to take our sur@@ name through the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father didn &apos;t want Paul and me to end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Politi@@ co reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive employees on his first day of work , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp White House he wanted to repair : bad information that was getting into the hands of the president .
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media diet .
President Tru@@ mp &apos;s relationship with television reaches decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television commerci@@ als are still strong .
&quot; when candidate Tru@@ mp was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of positions that were too convincing , &quot; said former election campaig@@ ner Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February compared to Pol@@ co .
political Co@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keeping Tru@@ mp Twitter w@@ ont be under control , according to six former election campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lob@@ b@@ ying . &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp Twitter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know about others - that Tru@@ mp twe@@ ets couldn &apos;t contain any more combus@@ tible material without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp did not send .
if his staff managed to keep his anger away from him a few times , then their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently prevented Tru@@ mp controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , are always trying to present their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp materials that possibly promote their views from the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politi@@ co - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to supply question@@ able information to the president for strategic reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with sham@@ eful ch@@ equ@@ es , and that he bra@@ ves to find out where they originate .
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously accused the president of a printed copy of an article from Got@@ tw@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy treas@@ urer K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter for har@@ ass@@ ment , or that he has not offered concrete evidence or that he has made false alle@@ gations in the past and has re@@ vo@@ iced them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp was reading the article and began asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gold @-@ maker added that the former Chief of Staff , Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and General Secretary of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work and to document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers still strive for influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
because the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped .
the police all over Europe sends this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy criminals naturally are not known , indications from the population are hoped and requested .
on Friday , Euro@@ pol reported on Friday the action that follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; Adv@@ ent calendar .

travelers negotiate a rift and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos;s Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ lords of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some hes@@ it@@ ant travelers at the foot of war who have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous Soli@@ hull road called the &quot; Million@@ aire &apos;s Series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by the dig@@ ging excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their attacks .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense posts and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry people have driven the Council of Soli@@ hull that said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous resident said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after being sent off by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
the Council must be forced by shame to implement it , as it was useless when dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more came last night , probably even more today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long teachings to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my com@@ mon@@ place if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a local people who didn &apos;t want to be called , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last lap of these travelers , just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another lap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised bearing on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to move them on as quickly as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ l is currently being renovated and will be re @-@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in the then ambi@@ ente company gesellschaft mbH from April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and income from the tourist tax was also lost .
in the autumn of 2014 , the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter in the context of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees , which caused controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ berger defended the hotel location and talked to serious interested parties at that time .
he should be right .
the group of Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zu@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , building sh@@ utt@@ les have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house you will see how extensive renov@@ ations are done .
the floors have been pulled out , ceilings partly disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the whole hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a beautiful hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a gem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an elevated downtown level , sha@@ ver points out .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its 60 rooms , wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause he has already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the city &apos;s ideas were identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the amount of investments asked , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to pin@@ point exactly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external systems are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace is created , which will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : United States Special Off@@ ers An@@ no@@ un@@ ces Grand Jury
in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special agent Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
the Panel resum@@ ed its work in recent weeks , wrote the Wall Street Journal calling on people familiar with the matter .
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had extended and intensified his investigations .
CN@@ N reported that there were already first invitations from the Committee in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Krem@@ lin of interfer@@ ing with the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were discussions between Tru@@ mp campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation will focus on several men acting as advis@@ ors to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller took a closer look at more and more Tru@@ mp &apos;s private and business environment .
the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Tru@@ mp personally moved to the center and asked whether the president could have imp@@ eded the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair .
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to apply an indictment .
Grand j@@ uries are also called the indictment .
mostly they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons under oath .
according to CN@@ N , invitations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who participated in the meeting were asked to make a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. , Tru@@ mp advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former election campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort took part in the interview .
on Thursday evening , legal experts said that the sub@@ stitution showed that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up in the end to decide on the charging of an accus@@ ation .
however , the establishment of the committee is the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tru@@ mp .
in the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affairs as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the theme gives the Democrats a chance to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but this also usually works in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House welcomes any measures that accelerated the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that he will not be determined against the President . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it continued to be explained in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been deployed after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this draft , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp have become loud , he has obstruc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June in front of a sen@@ ate committee , Tru@@ mp asked him for an investigation of the investigations against the National Security Ad@@ visor Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n at that time .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the representation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this triggered speculation about whether Tru@@ mp M@@ eller wanted to release Mu@@ eller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , around the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the beh@@ est of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a move .
two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented law@@ suits on Thursday , after which the investig@@ ator could no longer be dismissed as easily .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the Western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin was solved by the ice shelf .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the Kol@@ oss , which weighs over a tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving to the north and will probably need two , three years until it has melted .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that have registered researchers over the past three decades .
there is no danger for humans .
it is unclear to what extent climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of the ic@@ e@@ berg .
the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ simile leaves the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) for about 30 years .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf .
Sch@@ el@@ ho@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
north of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e the balance of wa@@ xing and ab@@ rupt was disturbed a few years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a complete ice shelf can be broken down there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes A@@ WI research scientist Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C scar@@ f file is in danger , as the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as currently .
in addition , the iron plate stands under tension and can decay if a piece breaks down at a key location .
melting of ice and ice does not increase the level of sea level as they float on the water and put ice as much water as it follows after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a limited extent , the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) writes .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf is the fourth biggest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca , with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks off regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most sweeping retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf will grow again or fall back on a long @-@ term basis and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said , &quot; Our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these scientists do not rel@@ inqu@@ ish the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , there have been a lot of ice @-@ s@@ nu@@ gg@@ ings in the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula in recent decades .
this long skirt of the Antar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
according to data from the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature contributed to the decline .
over the last 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has been warming up around three degrees and thus per@@ sist in areas where the temperature is fastest growing .
CD@@ U wants a house tari@@ ff at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U claims to withdraw from the employers &quot; association in order to become more attractive .
just before the summer break , the District Day saw 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them .
the courses in the circle are obviously very sought after .
there were around 6@@ 20 applications for the places to be found this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to lack staff in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present , there are still 50 non @-@ occupied places at the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , doctors and engineers as well as general administration are sought .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; management should develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term demands for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage .
the overall concept should ori@@ ent itself internally and extern@@ ally , demonstrate concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and involve a training initiative , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you did not know before .
other cities recru@@ it good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes a high number of employees who leave the service sick or age @-@ related .
the highest time for action , so that no more jobs will remain un@@ occupied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint application with his party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he took care of a big surprise already in the circle of the circle , when he publicly questioned the personnel costs cap and ba@@ ff@@ led the rest of the parties .
people want to verify that all possibilities are checked , which allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the county administration should aim with the trade unions - perhaps even in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a ho@@ ard rate , &quot; states peoples .
in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money are available only if you move to a higher level oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution law .
last but not least by the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ates the tone of NGO Mig@@ rants Res@@ cue Bo@@ ots
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs who use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , that they should not continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said interior minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came one day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German relief organization &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew worked effectively with traders in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express the detailed accus@@ ations of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio in Italy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue area at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in a statement on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations currently raised after collecting all the information and assessing the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that its crew will take din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which will be supplied to them directly by traffi@@ ckers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can go off so that they can be used again .
at least such a meeting occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor of the prosec@@ utor , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected of over@@ shad@@ owing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must first of all have an Italian police officer on board , who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations .
among those who refuse to sign up is the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate organization Mé@@ dec@@ ins sans Fron@@ ti@@ ères ( MS@@ F ) .
in the meantime , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has fallen sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berliner Ou@@ posts &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the northern Pfalz for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and sights .
three friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ - und W@@ einf@@ est von Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome bonus .
the first tour led with hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far across the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there was always longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the folk festival saus@@ age market .
again , look@@ out point reached the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ga &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
there were many al@@ timet@@ ers on the last two days .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shel@@ ters brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers at@@ ted a healing br@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium .

after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps itself for e @-@ sport
will the sport stars continue to sit in front of computer consoles , instead of being swe@@ at@@ y in the wind and weather over stadium racing ?
fact : e @-@ Sport has long since become a serious industry , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ its included .
this has also recognised the first German people who are increasingly involved in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be many clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Cup FIFA will organise the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in London , where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified for example .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in E @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now consul@@ ted an agency for virtual foot@@ ball@@ ers .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , it is possible to be present online much more often on these markets than to send the Bundes@@ liga to Asia only once a year .
what is it all about ?
when it comes to e @-@ sport , computer games such as League Of Legends , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or even FIFA &apos;s soccer simulation are challenged at a competitive level .
as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has long since established itself , in which the pros are competing against each other .
and in the Asian Games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing has also been dealing with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes .
it also needs cognitive abilities , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ l also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult for online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientist highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of E @-@ Sports .
the players are on the international road , this is like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural barriers .
a study by the company consultants Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth for e @-@ sport .
this means that in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
sales at 130 million are expected in three years .
there is little against the 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
however , the e @-@ sport is not far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants write .
many countries are already on the international level .
major markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez take part in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competition law Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there are a lot of things happening in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as instruc@@ tional compartment , says F@@ rob@@ bing .
according to D@@ utt , the Dutch and French football associations have now ple@@ dged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in European comparison , Germany is la@@ gging behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B board member R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nostal@@ gia to decay and to clarify the old times is no longer sufficient today .
it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but also to align the company on the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t stick to the fact that only football stays the same as it has always been . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poison eggs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - The egg @-@ alternatives to cooking and baking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all states are affected by the sc@@ andal caused by pois@@ oned eggs .

Michelle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the lyrics forcing Con@@ rad Roy to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend to commit suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for a neg@@ ligent murder of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is troubled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his vocation .
she had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life in order to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not take any responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has shown no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance which they completely regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz didn &apos;t find out that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , saying that there is &quot; no day in which I do not mour@@ ning the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I move with everything . I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity . &quot;
Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , testified that she would be &quot; persecuted &quot; by the knowledge that she would never be part of her brother &apos;s wedding or would be a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have this single person with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain that I will keep in mind for the rest of my life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a car in 2014 .
the case drew up national attention after Car@@ ter revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , jump from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter was seeking attention by Roy &apos;s death and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in Italy in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves sympathy and help , not jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ oto : learning from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ olos was allowed to run as a captain in the Audi Cup is no accident .
the FC Bayern shows a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation doesn &apos;t hurt there .
anything was different in his place in the cabin , that Joshua made me straight away , even though the additional piece of clothing was very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made the band@@ age to his arm .
&quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as a Bavarian captain .
good , the stand could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i was able to interpret the sign of the coach .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a player in the C @-@ El@@ f , which was made up of youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just from holidays , but he .
sugar is best distributed to those you want to do a lot that you want to keep in your mood .
so those who have been chosen to inher@@ it the legacy of Lah@@ m can only use a small extra motivation .
Kim@@ oto confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old flash@@ ed over the field as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m .
right rear , this is now his position , the white band@@ age on her arm did her rest .
and at all Kim@@ me worked in this initial formation as the one who can take the helm in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ coordinated tro@@ upe .
he had the view for the whole while many others were busy with himself .
Vi@@ dal tried to over@@ play his missing fitness ( barely collap@@ sed ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the devil , come out of the services of the Asia trip ( collap@@ sed also condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le did not neg@@ atively fall into their first appearance in Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ che , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted sovereign .
the n@@ asti@@ ly occupied Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried a few times successfully in the construction of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we have hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also picked up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw in the connection to the game .
for example , in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , Ru@@ dy did not give one or two interviews , but six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ oto said goodbye to a few words in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting proposition : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to win every game in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one more .

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises bis@@ cuits pace
it often became irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ demand of a change in economic policy - and simultaneously t@@ ad@@ ell the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around sees nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the gap between the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
this year the ministry hopes to set up a planning process , until 2021 is to be the right to build up the building .
a role in the plans of the country also allu@@ des to the west@@ ward en@@ cro@@ achment of Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Plan .
the aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ erial spokes@@ man Cor@@ nel@@ ia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
nat@@ us sees this as a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier is seeking , as by Wis@@ sing , a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ label to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports declining for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to create their own company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Commerce .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier is looking for an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the passed master test and 2500 Euros if graduates become self @-@ employed within ten years of master training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
according to Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry , Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) .
up to now , 56 new engineers , who want to employ Wis@@ sing in the state business , have only been occupied for 29 jobs .
the Chamber is calling for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U vice @-@ president , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the former broad@@ band expansion in the country is also sober@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated power supply in an I@@ HK survey with a score 3.4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
in contrast , E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , former Minister of Economy , is out of politics and is still sitting in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she cleaned up the field after four months of in@@ consisten@@ cies .
Audi aims to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi BMW said that it would offer to update the software to more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW president said that the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des em@@ itting diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and may cause asthma .
the cost of the car manufacturers to install systems for neutr@@ al@@ ising exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles also increases , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of for@@ s@@ aking the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies are trying to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ downs which regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were accused , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ cha@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after having accused Audi of installing a system to circum@@ vent emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded .
the involvement of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the benefit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft through Munich , which has a special message on Saturday , will go on Saturday .
if you take a closer look at the Is@@ ar on Saturday , you will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that is not a normal raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the Construction Department wants to clarify .
on the raft , one sees a big inf@@ low @-@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a garbage dump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of an public campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the motto &quot; True Love is ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be sharpen@@ ed as a protecting game of game .
last summer the raft sailed across the Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ dil@@ los &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and laughter against suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most widely published cartoon characters , the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still working on a film with 85 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he worked as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greetings cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough in the late 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own personal data , he still continues to work on the drawing table , working daily almost ten hours .
over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , T @-@ Shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his cute figures continue to spread widely worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon and a TV show with his figures for six years .
the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s most popular animal in his drawings - who has a jack of thousands as a counter player .
for the first time , his figures speak in 3D film , which is supposed to reach the projection screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what to say , it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
this is why he is relying on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of drought @-@ rec@@ alling conditions and insect @-@ carrying insects , which causes scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , causing severe headaches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is highly endangered since the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years , which has resulted in much less rainf@@ all in the spring and much more in autumn .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small ci@@ ch@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only for holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought .

assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they are to take their children into the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades , or leave them home .
security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings suff@@ ice .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from violence , and while throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are accum@@ ulating , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 years since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 .
among the latter is her publisher and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deeply , although his presence is everywhere present - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hanging on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special commission was established in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of kill@@ ings linked to drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime each year , the kill@@ ers are rarely tried by journalists .
in the case of Fe@@ odo@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is now even more tre@@ ach@@ erous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting has little benefit to the discussion of security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we all str@@ ust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; twelve river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the road or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of decorated , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug king@@ doms that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions contributed to the murder .
first , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival@@ ing anti@@ trust groups in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anger@@ ed the sons , suspected gang members bought any copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez not to leave the country for his own security after confis@@ c@@ ating another newspaper which had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for the Nor@@ o@@ sts in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to pursue journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the toxic@@ ity problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the paper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters loved to publish highly accurate research without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the foundation of Fe@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez gained the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it was leading .
he gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task assigned to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the o@@ dol@@ ce team measures Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who could curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine his ruin ?
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret starting and landing ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells bad , stay away from it .
the trouble is , the editor of the Fe@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vil@@ lar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happens to Ja@@ vier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
days before it became known that sp@@ y@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters were wondering if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , who the governor described as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it has been months since the re@@ porters went to the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce was on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of ex @-@ known Bo@@ xer Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to the state expendi@@ tures , which concentrated on the governor &apos;s home town .
and there was a group that conducted a kidn@@ apping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolutionary Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled nearly the whole century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors have been accused of corruption for high @-@ profile cases .
Vil@@ lar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , readers would have viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vil@@ lar@@ real , 46 , nick@@ named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slim body style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was re@@ dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez gra@@ bbed a few notes and went next morning to a demonstration due to a further journalist in the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is its .
in the whole country journalists have grown lou@@ dly by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on side@@ walks and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and attempts to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and letting them kill them because they told the truth .
she has since then asked her to be re @-@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
Val@@ dez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a uniform society .
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with the organised crime .
last year , the media guard group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to hold your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was said to have been signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones are lying next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava B@@ reach in March .
others continue , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted like it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight out of Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admitted that drug traffi@@ cking troubled him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became a re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat at the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began to bu@@ zz .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with riv@@ ets and security forces near the seaside resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate , as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell Emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the st@@ ony edge , they have published the news on the website of the reef via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show them .
under the powerful portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his footsteps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think of it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Ja@@ vier was murdered on the same day , the intern asked me to send her to the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to ev@@ ade its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , though a frigh@@ tening .
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the unbelievable N@@ ash@@ ore of a Canadian min@@ er have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even notice that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of a &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot;
the report in the journal &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described it as &quot; the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of noc@@ tur@@ au@@ rs living in the middle of the chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
its incredibly well @-@ preserved state amaz@@ es researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossi@@ ls of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Radio when he gru@@ b 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Millennium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossi@@ ls discovered by him were sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy soil .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe it slept , &quot; said the author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a walking tank , probably was threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counterpart , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed him to better mix in his surroundings and ev@@ ade his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the family of the No@@ do au@@ rier made head@@ lines in May and is now shown in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ ors over his body .
they discovered the counter sh@@ ading , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its base .
although the sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds the animals living today .
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by eating din@@ osau@@ rs by eating car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ oured the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals campaig@@ ning against sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than boot@@ y , which signals that this No@@ do @-@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ or behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r shows how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r predat@@ ors of the circle have been , &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red@@ dish brown .
scientists continue to examine the animal for evidence about his life , including his preserved intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and driven out into the sea , where he sun@@ k on his back to the se@@ abed .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much farther inland than they are today .
&quot; this no@@ dose @-@ din@@ osau@@ r is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early circle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just squ@@ ash a bit with your eyes , you could almost believe that he &apos;s going to sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his frigh@@ tening ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons wei@@ ghty monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings are published in Current Bi@@ ology , believe that after death , Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sun@@ k and m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in the mud after death .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Radio when he gru@@ b 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Millennium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the best @-@ preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to hips .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that were ra@@ ging from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the fortified plant @-@ e@@ ater was swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hau@@ tro@@ ste still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rarely as a gain in the lot@@ to .
the more I look at it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales at his sole &apos; .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass Kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , kilometres long stalls - and G@@ aff@@ er .
about 20 people were injured on the Stuttgart @-@ München ( A@@ 8 ) motorway on the late afternoon of Thursday .
according to the first data of the police , around 17.@@ 00 o &apos;clock between the jun@@ ctions Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg district ) during a thunder@@ storm , almost 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , crashed into each other .
the exact number of injured la@@ gs initially lack@@ ed data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of mild to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large supply of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
a ten @-@ kilometre back @-@ sta@@ u was formed in the direction of Munich .
as reported by an A@@ Z journalist , there was also a massive handi@@ cap on the counter @-@ track - due to numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ gade was writing down the characteristics of the vehicle hand@@ le@@ bars , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. a second accident took place on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ alo .
if the conductor comes and w@@ akes an uns@@ an@@ ured one , or breaks the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
map control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the paper@@ less ticket inspection .
you simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and use it to vali@@ date your ticket .
there is currently a test run on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer arrives , we will expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be available on many other long @-@ haul routes in Germany in early next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trains the ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers anyway .
it also has to be purchased via the web app , the DB Navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of booking .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one goes into the train , calls his ticket to &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test customers then form a button for the electronic de@@ valuation .
the train companions receive a notification on their mobile devices , that passenger X is in the train and has taken the reserved seating place Y .
if the train atten@@ dant arrives at the ticket inspec@@ tor in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket .
one can therefore continue to sleep , continue to work , keep silent .
the check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; if you want to travel without ticket control by our train service personnel , please check the DB Navig@@ ator yourself .
this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Fern@@ verkehr &apos;s Marketing Management Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who travel often know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are among the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances .
because often you have , in any case , one of the fellow travelers not having all the documents you need to de@@ grade online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to poor mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling their own tickets and takes the conductor at the end time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .
and this is only on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen connections .

how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken up to its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , she was sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police had just killed an 18 year old child and it still lies on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , as no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened t@@ witter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly rescu@@ ed at her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ ets the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s lifel@@ ess body which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she laid off her cell phone to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people shou@@ ting , and of a man who claimed to be a father &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed in which a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman secured his gun and cried : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals kill everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l rec@@ alled their statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we get used to and that we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 11@@ am she picked up her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened over the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance which consists of the people &apos;s point of view , who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a fitting crown , the two talked a conversation , which they had innumerable times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed an 18 year old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take them with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a cul@@ mination of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do in order to be free to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is not different from the next black female child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp site when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Chief Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s form .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed completely after August 9 , &quot; she said , and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organizing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s all coming . &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
one question came Fer@@ rel@@ l in the sense : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit ? &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often wh@@ ites - in a community prof@@ iting from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We heard that people who were born and grown up in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not have their votes centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had worked together with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ ked in@@ mates .
his engagement brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we talk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result , Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets do show personal aspects of Ferr@@ is &apos;s life as she falls in love with her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s story repeated the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who , after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin , marked the film &quot; Black@@ magic Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; black women in leadership positions took the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it insi@@ sts however that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no accident , although she was at the forefront , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman stands so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , the security cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking an auto@@ bahn at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless , she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels bound to this memory ever since she went to the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support one another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania : TV readers are discussing bit @-@ gallery
the bit @-@ gallery moves people even though they haven &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct cle@@ aves the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the topic hardly leaves the subject cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one to the bit gallery says : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while advoc@@ ates build that a gallery draws more customers into the city , including the rest of the business , the opponents fear that the pedestrian prec@@ inct ble@@ eds .
in addition , the gallery is being planned right on the property on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be concluded .
the Galerie @-@ M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Zimmer : &quot; for many years we have been shopping in the farmer &apos;s market hall almost every week .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the farm women again and again very much .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there are also .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing resi@@ des in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this might not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what &apos;s a shopping list in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think it is superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of it in our city .
you can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not yet a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved .
after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mostly sold directly by the producer and is also inexpensive .
as you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only le@@ ased by larger companies , because the rentals there are often not portable for a retailer .
too bad , specialty stores almost no longer exist and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmers market hall be during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit @-@ gallery actually comes out sometime .
or does the spec@@ ter bit gallery already manage to sell all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that won &apos;t work .
and there is no need to buy a shopping centre that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg won &apos;t be a place anymore .
when the farmer &apos;s market hall is damaged , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost un@@ notic@@ e@@ ably similar - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ le@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st had a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after being classified as secret diplom@@ acy about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming St@@ resem@@ b@@ lance ( a matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg who discipline her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ gres@@ sman and a pioneering dissi@@ dent whose condem@@ nation was turned into Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
by algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that was extracted from Mann@@ ing and created out of 30 portraits , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg developed a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations , but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born in Brad@@ ley Edward but openly talked about the identification as a woman since its pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
her image was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie where Mann@@ ing is obviously sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ ts and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from tr@@ ash to produce a picture of how these people could look .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; declared De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg during a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned mice became un@@ equal friends who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ o Images &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which President Chelsea would en@@ act judgment and would be able to personally see the exhibition .
that Obama actually only a few days after the book was published , the release of Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of lucky coincidence .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tru@@ mp leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he should fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things can happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Mann@@ ing demanded an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
with the inclusion of the 200 characters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific le@@ x@@ icon of the artist ) , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ lö@@ v hoped to show how astonishing similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with them is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in its own space , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic novel .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she emerges with a free @-@ talk ef@@ on in his hand from the United States disciplinary teams like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they put your words in the cold , they won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , which gather together like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also aimed at everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing &apos;s stat@@ ure ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University due to murder
a country@@ wide chase is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , who are sought as susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ dies ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the Cook County Local Court .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several bites .
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene of the events , and det@@ ectives investigate the en@@ grav@@ ings as murder while police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
she has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Par@@ bage , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail stating that he was now in a state of absence and had been excluded from entering the Nor@@ th@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail declaration that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help US investig@@ ators in any way . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he insi@@ sted strongly on the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Grand Plaza management team published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police is currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will finish the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian vice @-@ president Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t last long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road map has been updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code describing the criteria for the replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not include anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to state funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has acknowledged a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales agency r@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing control in Russia in November 2015 as part of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal .
however , it was allowed to plan and co @-@ ordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after visiting the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving in the right direction in order to be re@@ inst@@ ated .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful , or worse - dec@@ ei@@ ving .
even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there simply never existed consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
it has called people from outside for help .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ up race is on the rise to help companies find out how their staff feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , provide special groups and demo@@ graphics groups , provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive Officer of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee involvement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ vation said that they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it provides a heat map of the company which shows at a glance which units have the most ail@@ ments and which managers have low con@@ tainment results so that you can re@@ bo@@ ve , why .
companies are expected to remain at the forefront of workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber wrapped in sc@@ and@@ als ever since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken were punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance business could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ oot in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
CH has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
U@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ ents lets companies send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which enables employees to report bad behavior .
and when the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regulator , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company finds its employees poorly treated or beha@@ ves un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
in the past , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a timi@@ d and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to pursue the complaints of staff .
now , as the company uses Con@@ ver@@ ents , problems that have previously been hidden by executives who have been sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment , or unfair practi@@ c@@ ations - can be identified and addressed more quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Engagement in 2002 seriously after Arthur Ander@@ sen &apos;s accounting firm collap@@ sed due to ethical infrin@@ gements by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry going online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and debit the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors that have supported both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cent earned $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which raised the entire capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itter@@ ern secured himself $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and raised his entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only assignments .
employees want to have the feeling that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that has heard their voices , and that the work that you do is worth it , they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , both used both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors achieve yields when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data about employee engagement in the workplace culture experts is important .
but the data is useless if the management of a company does not take action .
in fact , when a company asks for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough or not at all , dis@@ appointments can raise and hire employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting with the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow co @-@ workers wondering , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , such as Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this will lead to a better engagement of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vit@@ rano said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose company .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it &apos;s up to 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers chat on one side of the team &apos;s new practice fields .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these in@@ active minutes represent a lunch break .
players enrolled in the Summer Cour@@ ses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Club next morning at 6 : 30 p.m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday was on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of players , and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 7 : 15 a.m. to meet the already packed schedules of players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the h@@ um postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ a &apos;s six seasons in West@@ wood practical exercises carried through .
20 before the start of formal playing preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports the rule change of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they continued to plac@@ ate , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which is not an easy task given the clear sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and the neighboring Lus@@ kin Center , a high @-@ class hotel that has already been covered with pe@@ els that have a protective net behind a door@@ post .
Bru@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ check in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ f@@ eit messages to third parties and then display their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news .
the company stated in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and to send them to factor inspec@@ tors that may display results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook was critici@@ zed as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential election in May , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to get rid of hat@@ eful posts like before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts scrut@@ iny was launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to finding out what stories of fak@@ es from third parties are being challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
she added that Facebook continues to test its feature on the &quot; related article &quot; and is working on other changes in its news feed to reduce false messages .
a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosm@@ opol@@ itan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ dile@@ ction for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story has been illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Herzog ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expectedly emotional .
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb @-@ print on the side of a letter that was written by a double @-@ agent in the 1700 &quot; s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb @-@ print ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and letters smell like smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there .
Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting a little &quot; ) , it seems all too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; New &quot; castle , looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ches .
he wander@@ ed through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and talked with fellow country@@ men , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and started to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access only in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , employees just began to look after the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps showing what he owned : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
guys , let everything go its way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se on a broader base in English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book called &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter that the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English re@@ formation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l was depicted from the 18th century , who staged his own burial by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; lords seemed to be quite cro@@ o@@ ks , always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l &apos;s men rede@@ emed their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to adverti@@ se educ@@ ation@@ . &quot;
after the end of his essay in the castle Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences
he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ ki , the land of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ n life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

with the opening of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) on Friday .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team wish to keep the logo and the slogan secret until Thursday .
at the end of August it is supposed to be the highlight of the campaign on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking the posters at the chapel at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their yesterday &apos;s out@@ dated website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in essence , we believe that as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer we are well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action is more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally she stands in competition with other municipalities .
the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f costs an average five @-@ figure amount for its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) consul@@ ts in Ankara on retirement and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting no longer took place in the building of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the head of the head of the government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Ministers also took part in the consultations .
thus the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the over@@ population .
the government is moving the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the commander of the army , the air forces and the na@@ vy have been dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the ex@@ iled pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the re@@ actor of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people , who are supposed to have participated directly in the coup attempt , will be negotiated in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan declared the coup attempt as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have a grip on the army ?
at the end of February , the paper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ fur@@ y in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ scar@@ f for soldiers , wrote the paper .
in any case , the large @-@ scale teaching of the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan issued another 7@@ 3@@ 95 civil servants by decree , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual lords of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan urged the military &apos;s power step by step , not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is deliberately driving an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; an especially un@@ named officer , who sought asylum after a coup attempt in fear of persecution in foreign countries , warned the Turkish army in a few years &quot; full extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts . &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not allow Nato to be cold .
anyway , in the alliance after cleansing , there is doubt about the commitment of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted by the media .
he fores@@ ees to lower the legal immigration to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do this by changing the way citizens from other countries will be issued green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media .
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for motor@@ sport shuttle
again and again over the past few months over the future of the race track sh@@ utt@@ les has been cont@@ ested - now it is supposed to be quite fast .
at the end of the year , it is supposed to be built on the high @-@ end track on which the tourist train runs .
in order to secure the future of the race track system in the long term , construction work will begin again this year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country comm@@ its itself to this particularly important link to tourism , &quot; explained Minister of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
the costs for the repair of the track amounted to approximately EUR 2.5 million .
from this sum , the country sur@@ passes 75 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future , is currently being voted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ in@@ gia railway as operators already agree on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company is closed for a period of 11 years .
as a result , the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle will be ordered regularly in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a railway connection popular especially for tourists between the stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , during a pilot operation , it has been tested whether the route is used by a large number of people to order it regularly in the future .
the track is also strongly b@@ ung@@ aled in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just as you thought it can &apos;t become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots will come .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , a professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we have to start taking her ascen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nail .
&quot; people make fun of it , but companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the publication of his new report .
modern sex d@@ olls evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can &quot; adjust &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the nip@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails .
but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progressive .
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ Bu@@ oti@@ x robot provides for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed Person@@ alities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of timi@@ dity and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that matches your personality as best as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the True Compan@@ ion website .
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
during the day she also has her m@@ oods - quite like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this ascen@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent feminine features , the allu@@ sions to rape if you take a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , upset one most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy was compared with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toys .
their emergence and increasing sophisti@@ cation are pointing towards something darker and deeper in our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subj@@ ection as an optional addition .
most men , of course , will not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R recognizes their rising popularity , they nevertheless remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what se@@ eps out of the edge areas can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting unless the free market gives them permission to do so .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened all over the world in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have sexually attacked women .
the most deter@@ rent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the worn body and the stoch@@ astic eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , when it comes to &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women .
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no intermedi@@ ation or background story , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total sub@@ ju@@ gation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other words , they are false slaves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or to express it in the phr@@ asing of 2017 : maid
Tru@@ mp great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions that have pol@@ arized the US voters have divided families in small formats .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day in the USA there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp choosing relatives .
we are all re@@ port@@ edly trying to blow up our filter bags .
less noticed is the power of trucks to bring together families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side .
for the dining table it is certainly a good thing , but it is in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the issuing power of his presi@@ dency has the power to push all of us to the right .
when we speak of &quot; normal@@ isation &quot; and tru@@ mp , we refer to the ridi@@ culous possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer be dischar@@ ged .
however , there is an even more start@@ ling long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
today I find myself covered by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % in@@ comes tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both compared to Tru@@ mp in fact a very mild criminal off@@ ence .
when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must only be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are extremely large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals twist in order to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ishing music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not just the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Them@@ e @-@ Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not counted - but a big round@@ about in northern London .
but the Central Park @-@ car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have assessed the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but luckily no one asked for it .
on the other hand , this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required .
the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ used , while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a visit to hospital .
last year , he was hospit@@ alized for the treatment of cuts on his wrist , which he reported to the prison authorities in a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 , firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he had his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der hidden in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National prosecution authority said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us runs a risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the schools in Blum@@ berger , the four @-@ door pupils from F@@ hats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and the secondary schools .
three of the students go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
school@@ master An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te greeted the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on Tuesday evening .
the 29 pupils of the four classes , under the leadership of Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle , who grew up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eagle in the poultry farm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led the lively band &quot; The Eagle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to hat@@ ch from his chickens .
instead of a chicken , a little eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him sm@@ ashed , the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and escaped .
after that , classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Y@@ von@@ ne Frank .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , who wore cylinders to make the bet .
the Eagle stands for integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te .
the young animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wished for every fourth grade student to feel accepted in his new school .
there was a thank @-@ word to the colleagues , former school manager Michael Müller , who always jumps back at teaching pas@@ sports , and the parents &apos; representatives .
the cu@@ cum@@ ber era is over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher has declared .
she divor@@ ces her students after two years of instruction only very reluct@@ antly because it had been a really great time .
finally she was able to rely on the neighborhood fort@@ resses .
at the end , all students could hear a song of summer time and holiday time .
in doing so , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ grade students are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , par@@ ted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television .
in the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal people arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while an investigation is currently underway .
the State Department reported that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have sharpen@@ ed control of the free camp and put up everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the Court could impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do Diesel drivers have to take part in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel peak , BMW , Daimler , Opel and VW @-@ Group have offered software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emission performance of cars in emission classes of Euro 5 and , in some cases , Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives ratings :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the software updates handled are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates are only valid for vehicles that have che@@ ating software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Office ( KBA ) has ordered their retro@@ fitting .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but has not yet been called an exact date .
Daimler advised to write to every affected person .
if any inspection is due anyway , this will be done within the scope of the inspection .
how long will the retro@@ fits take place altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
this depends on manufacturers &apos; commitment and political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen that car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the update last ?
the change@@ over itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do drivers do that do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and VW @-@ Group ?
the ace advises to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a threat of a massive decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
in rural areas , there has so far been no loss of value for older diesel engines .
the ace advises to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to become political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come - in protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center .
this year singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) were among the hon@@ orable singers .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp will hold a reception and join with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the award winner Le@@ ar , who was introduced with progressive TV series , already announced that he would refrain from taking part in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to ev@@ ade them - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use Tru@@ mp to clarify her point of view .
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
among the earlier winners are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city life worth
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach &apos;s City Engineer , will reti@@ re next year .
the job is already written - however , suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a city building master for 31 years .
and the work makes him still great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press brief@@ ing .
he reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , it surprises him that so far no application has been satisfied with the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
so - considering the regular termination periods - there should be enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach works for the administration community as an under@@ e construction law office , the applicant has to show corresponding statements .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they cannot fill in this , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but citizen proximity is important to the city and it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and good mood between authority and citizen .
in more than 30 years in office , some major projects have been collected , looking back on the chi@@ pper with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life worth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building department and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park@@ platz has been initiated .
the Kin@@ zig Bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my success@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work here is fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a city architect , there is a lot of room for design .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and nursery , we can react very flexibly to many things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits in , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring Stadt@@ bau@@ meister stresses .
anyway , the City Engineer bears high respon@@ s@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of support and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere , but also for the further shaping of the city .
according to information provided by the city of Has@@ lach , who would like to be buried under the supervision of Roland W@@ acker should be able to show a completed degree as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s degree in Architecture and have good expertise in the fields of building arrangement and planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ( Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ) are subject to civil engineering , civil engineering , building instruction , urban renewal , administration of urban properties , urban farming estate with a building court and urban gardening centre , as well as the Lower House of Construction Law , including preservation of monuments .
bike thrown on lines : southern track closed
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track system in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) to the lines .
these were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be hal@@ ted .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and search for them since the night .
near the crime scene , a ros@@ em@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said E@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators brought themselves in great danger themselves and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the late @-@ minute drive and the costs for rail sub@@ stitution , P@@ ön@@ alen of the railway customers could also face the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , there was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the Southern Rail@@ road was possible without any hind@@ ran@@ ce .
nearly ten people were missing Friday morning , two of them concerned the long distance traffic .
freight trains did not inv@@ ade , but they had a delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in Great Britain causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while those affected are normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinal system .
the senior researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , said that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
experiments have found that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell is present in mice carrying a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a link between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their diet , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. Cross and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promote a more tolerant , less inflammatory intestinal system if the same system works with people .
the post@@ do@@ k@@ tor@@ an@@ din Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was investigating a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe who was however separate , did not have this .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ cos@@ a had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six bacteria species found in mice with the immune cells were found , but without them missing in mice .
mice were brought up in a sterile environment , so that a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they were given to the L. Cross and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria depen@@ ded on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i left in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ metabolism , known as the i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. Cross are protected in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in humans with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflamm@@ ations on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. Cross can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a genius with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut versus S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last off @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder &apos;s role when people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira acted at will .
matic , however , had been excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and made only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho ad@@ mits that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready to be ready before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u entered the Avi@@ va Stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho made his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three other new obligations , but he insi@@ sted that the club already had a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of his four primary new obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in Mich@@ ig@@ an State and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the radar screens were the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising before .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , S &amp; D prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern .
only there were no stor@@ ks from the central party , but no antagon@@ ism from the federal government - that was the most important requirement of the electoral fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , that has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ ruled provincial capitals with growing horror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described in the approach with a head@@ wind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were deep strikes .
and one by one .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; that shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not rule reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to Germany &apos;s editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising faction exit from a Green MP has thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the election of the Parliament , its red @-@ green coalition thus lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party executive Michael Kell@@ ner asked El@@ ke T@@ jackets to return her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transition to the CD@@ U means clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ ke T@@ ests must immediately give back her mandate , &quot; said the Federal Executive and Ele@@ ction Manager of the Gre@@ ens , Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election campaig@@ ners &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; si@@ ghs when the new hi@@ ker message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , Prime Minister of the SPD of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without its own government majority after the assault of the Green MP El@@ ke T@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the preliminary climax of a series of big and small crises in the SPD state associations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and no one knows what comes next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mis@@ er started with the un@@ expectedly significant defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades cal@@ med at his time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this was done - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a tum@@ ble , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te hur@@ led the party smoothly .
the comrades were pain@@ stak@@ ingly cra@@ cking up in the weeks afterwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , when they had just hat@@ ched new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with him came the next draft .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD regional chief , lost his nim@@ bus this weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his town was burning .
and because in crisis communications he got pretty much everything wrong about what you can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust @-@ affair and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Minister @-@ President had already been in the criticism for some time now .
previous survey values were added .
nevertheless , or maybe just for this reason , Wei@@ l tried to put emphasis on the Con@@ federation in recent weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin remained un@@ concealed in the environment of Martin Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they allowed him to be granted a stabil@@ isation of the party .
now the exact opposite could happen .
because of this , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the internal pressures of the Lower Saxony Green Party .
and Mr Schulz did not at all .
for the time being , comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed toward the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the stub@@ born Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ v@@ ests .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democr@@ ati@@ ve@@ able , as Mrs. T@@ v@@ ests puts her own career fairs on the interests of everyone else , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , chief of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS T@@ v@@ ests has not been elected as a direct candidate for its individual , but has been elected to Parliament by the State List of the Lower Saxony Green Party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters &quot; wil@@ dest four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the federal election election , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clarify the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments to the CD@@ U of Lower Saxony .
funding for the City Council III
those who want to renov@@ ate their home in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg Urban Development informed us on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the brief@@ ing , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a look back on what happened so far .
since 1991 , there have been in certain areas of renovation .
back then , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding .
in the area of refurb@@ ishment II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , recent renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is important to promote internal development and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , I received the information from the Pres@@ i@@ dency of Karlsruhe that there will be a renovation area III .
the funding amount was 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , amoun@@ ting to 500 000 euros from the country , the rest from the community .
how does a rehabilitation zone develop ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it also plays a role as to whether interest exists in the planned territory .
if necessary , the area borders could then shift again .
the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
Keller presented the contents of the federal government programme &quot; Social City , &quot; where the renov@@ ations would then be carried out .
the core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving living conditions and working relationships , and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , i.e. per plot .
the area of refurb@@ ishment would then be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the funding period for funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 , until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September of this year , however , the stock resum@@ ption would be carried out only once , within the framework of which the participants in the rehabilitation area received a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , the aim of the constitution is to take place as far as possible , so that the renov@@ ations can begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that every commun@@ e had to carry out the said pre @-@ examinations .
the aim is to assess the urban ab@@ uses and decide when to rehabil@@ itate and to what extent .
for the particular property there will also be a mem@@ or@@ and@@ um in the ground@@ book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sens@@ ations and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
this is why there will be questionna@@ ires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Building and Land Ar@@ ms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with which , among other things , it deals with the structural condition and the rehabilitation perspectives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing sheets , &quot; information on size , layout and residents of a living room can be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Work@@ sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled out if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to be aware , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still emphasized that the distribution of the subsidies after the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; works - who comes first , gr@@ ind first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there could be no funding for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , photos of the project &quot; Location Group II &quot; were shown in order to make the present a &quot; tasty . &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip so that he can open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between the thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory An@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per castle .

the White House &apos;s advertising costs cost tens of thousands of tax@@ pa@@ yers
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production last month will cost tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military provided to TI@@ ME Magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over 50 countries .
the Connec@@ ti@@ cut helicopter was on display next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire@@ man and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House military office requested the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the deputy naval Commander for Aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock and so long stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would be required for the return flight .
the original crew was at the helicopter while the security guards stayed on the plane during the time on the plane .
from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .
data sets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; one question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform that was under way in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as na@@ vy One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pres@@ idents are required to use them for the journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but to request their use only for a photo surgery is unusual .
Tru@@ mp launched an investigation in February when the presidential jet made use of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential jet through its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made In America , &quot; which shows products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy press secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew are often conducting training flights around Washington and South La@@ wn to deal with precise centimet@@ ers in the White House in the White House .
when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 practice land@@ ings in the White House .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event counted at the training requirements of the flight crew for the month , said a be@@ amer .
helicop@@ ters units also flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ Pres@@ idential support missions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers accepted the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not run budget records for the Pres@@ idential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for re@@ funds is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the action of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things produced in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people are dependent on it .
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course it is appropriate to highlight that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
at the White House , Tru@@ mp responded to Si@@ kor@@ sky &apos;s representatives and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tri@@ cky job
the runner @-@ up of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga appears at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss ki@@ cks off tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite the five games still flaw@@ less balance sheet , the leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga has gotten the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports from the high north are concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to bets during the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ sey ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be hard for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you also need good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high north is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man who is currently active in the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man does not come to the Bundes@@ liga @-@ game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) will come to his first use this season .
the previously un@@ defeated boy Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was at the AT@@ P Tournam@@ ent in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski .
he should also be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ scho@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again move into the team .
if it is not enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Junior World Ranking List in January 2016 , someone from the trainer will fill the cad@@ re from the trainer to Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
how America can harm the O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp was not really happy when he signed his signature under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the US thrust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft plan is to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors of O@@ MV , who together with other European companies co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Eastern Se@@ eds Nord Stream 2 , have been dis@@ qui@@ eted since then .
the dr@@ one is huge .
however , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp even had to bring the sanctions by executive order to life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen what the corporation could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ row Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put into the centre of the hit series by Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer revealed , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first got their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show .
with the third season , the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organisation of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful sponsors , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 Company &quot; with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro returns to Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on 1 September .
roll back : the city introduces 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch @-@ table itself again .
with permanent contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban day@@ care centres , the watch is turned back .
on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the urban day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it continues to be cooked except for a house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and provides fresh energy ch@@ illed .
the city operates 46 day@@ care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , and in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the last year of kit@@ esur@@ fing 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are looked after 45 hours of the week are eating in the day@@ time K@@ ita , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time staff have a kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the cooked foods , complement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruits , divide the meal individually , fill the meal , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a k@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven troops - decides about the ho@@ ur@@ ly range .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the ita , a person familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also has the charm that it has turned out in the cost comparison between self @-@ regulation and foreign lending for the city as the most economical one , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours do not weigh so strongly in the field of education , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the leader of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , official director of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are chann@@ eling in the elections in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble when women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the election process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential election will take place on April 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Taliban published threats against a election process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
this year elections for the first time will hand over power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reported that 1.2 million women from a total of registered 3,@@ 6 million voters were registered .

men trying to eradic@@ ate 13 year old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 years old are said to have tried to ro@@ b a 13 year old girl .
according to the police , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone with the girl &apos;s cell phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old rejected the request but continued with her friends .
as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the cell phone and the necklace of the girl , which , however , mis@@ used .
the duo escaped without prey .
the two young men were later arrested by the police .
the investigations are underway .
G@@ MB concern about investing in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to check out the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow , for managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland said that the company was weighing over the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work at the plant , which , in addition to other products , produces tea and rich tea bis@@ cuits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and union representatives were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie called for &quot; express concern that funding for moderni@@ zing production lines would not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply concerned with our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrated heavily on the local community and the Glasgow metropol@@ itan area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production down@@ fall , the east@@ ern@@ most end of Glasgow urgently needs a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman from Mr Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react immediately , since we appreciate the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , continually review our business - and that applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross plant , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not be prosec@@ uted in its persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar after having given an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack ?
the sensational approach has hal@@ ted the transfer window in summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the past season .
after the completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a spring close to the Catal@@ ana clan insi@@ sts that the club always has his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned by the PS@@ G president three years ago in front of this prospect ?
when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ i@@ fi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to subscribe to one of the best PS@@ G players .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to subscribe to one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , where the Spanish Club expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its quot@@ ations for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter dis@@ car@@ ded and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday an unknown perpetr@@ ator has deliberately kno@@ cked down a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the property number 30 and thus caused damage to the vehicle in case of damage of more than 200 Euros .
the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , ask for instructions .
the police are looking for witnesses to an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
because a car came to meet him in his lane , the driver had to leave a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the guard plan@@ ks .
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old came from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW versus 19.@@ 5@@ pm on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au to Le@@ ese .
in the area of the village circum@@ ference of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a car came to meet him in his lane so that he had to devi@@ ate to the right .
in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ ted the guard plan@@ ks .
in cars , material damage was caused .
the driver of the passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his ride without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident victim , it can be good that the car driver had not noticed the accident at all .
the police now asks for witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the causing vehicle to contact the com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au under Tel . 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cathedral S@@ cra@@ er Report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse is reli@@ eved by pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the opinion of author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement , &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared by the former Regensburg bishop and present @-@ day car@@ dinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Cathedral Choir Master George R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the former Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would be very useful to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false assessment of the processes at that time .
the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in the reporting of violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; double standards &quot; were measured .
regarding the attacks in Regensburg , nobody doubts that it is about &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; is conspic@@ uous , &quot; explains the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday life and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; people like to go to the church and that &apos;s a fe@@ eb@@ le fres@@ co . &quot;
she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; blows had been a very normal educational tool , &quot; to be done with bold children as I was one . &quot;
it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for past decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports of abuse , Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes , who wrote the mem@@ or@@ and@@ um &quot; My brother to the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to protect Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the solic@@ itor Ms. Ulrich Weber from the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s .
in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , says : &quot; in summary , it can be said that in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. .
especially in case of high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could be more severe .
nevertheless , in contrast to many other alle@@ gations , many cas@@ u@@ alties cher@@ ished the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him in many cases . &quot;
in the interview , H@@ esh@@ bon explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger explains in his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence against protective char@@ ms at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; is a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
on the one hand , many students emphas@@ ise his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as a ch@@ oline @-@ cler@@ k and a perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became pal@@ p@@ able when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz did not bring any top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as its bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : when you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it .
it is precisely about eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted by any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also occurred outside his sphere of influence .
one can at best repro@@ ach him , learn from it too late or have taken first indications not seriously enough .
the domain gym@@ nasi@@ um on which he worked was perceived by virtually all those sur@@ vey@@ ed as &quot; Rede@@ mption , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; Bet@@ ter World . &quot;
thus , the broad majority of his disciples , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , also exhibits an excellent testimony , describing him as &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly fed the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and candy , and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to scre@@ ams .
the fact that he did not only b@@ ang with chairs and cast the keys on the ground , but also distributed ear @-@ cow@@ ards and drew too che@@ ek@@ y guys to the hair or ears , he himself admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and ap@@ olog@@ ises for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the fra@@ il times , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers .
do you know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a high school .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fying sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are ad@@ mitt@@ edly bag@@ at@@ elles .
one wonders whether it is not more likely to do with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media just r@@ ushed on him .
many people who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently at the Bavarian Pope .
but the truth is : the report is reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
the media reported a lot about abuse in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also be accused of involvement in sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted themselves to the Cathedral Choir Master .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one affected representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing was very embarrass@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the education of sexual abuse has been and is , however , that most of the victims are silent .
if they did not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators , in a professional way , to a certain extent .
how do you rate the R@@ atz@@ inger R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case where he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
I consider it ... even to be really absurd to assume that it is just for him ... to have more intru@@ sive or clearer or more opened than in relation to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ al leaders , tru@@ ste@@ es , etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... is un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report concludes with the clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment affected him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is to be acqu@@ itted by any co @-@ worker .
nor can he be accused of obstruc@@ ting him or having brought him to the adver@@ t .
therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as was unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; looking away &quot; in the report .
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything was mixed up and mixed up in the reporting to a huge thr@@ ong of sexual abuse and exc@@ esses and somewhere , right in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is precisely what is a mis@@ use of the report .
namely , there is a clean separation : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the gym@@ nasi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and exc@@ esses of violence as well as , we once say , other repro@@ aches .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the cathedral @-@ cats .
the whole aw@@ ful investig@@ ator pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly har@@ assed and portrayed , and were terri@@ bly suffering , were all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions must have reigned .
but with those Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger didn &apos;t have anything to do , because he got the boys only to see when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the theme of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was on the one hand , like most of the witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you were only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ cal &quot; conditions .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline already , but no sa@@ di@@ stic force .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims praised the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him in many cases . &quot;
at most , the blame remains to have di@@ gest@@ ed away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he was just beginning to establish himself and from his predec@@ essors at a school where he was not working and was responsible ( so the witness ) did not want to hear , and then only in 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut the ears in front of the conditions ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um , who even reproduced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pres@@ ch@@ ool , the punishment will continue to be practiced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended penet@@ rating engagement .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as an investig@@ ator , had long been banned in Bavaria .
before that , they took place in a legal grey zone , as each one of us probably knows .
it was difficult for him to estimate where the affected people might have been exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed , and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
that is simply not true .
only in 1980 , the punishment for schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis said it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to that time .
how do you see it ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating past moral standards .
the princess is right .
but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times , and not for what was f@@ aded in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the then usual .
it &apos;s all horrible and I &apos;m glad that it finally is working out .
but at the same time I have to protect Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , that is to say ear @-@ cow@@ ards and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then banned , he has kept strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his time in the Regen@@ s@@ burger times was Georg R@@ atz@@ inger playing in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject of punishment come into speech ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective that the dom@@ es played only a secondary role .
nevertheless , I did not at all ent@@ ail that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but this also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world tran@@ g institution , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and candy alone , one does not even get a big singer and before every success from un@@ ru@@ ly boys , regardless of which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger talking about her book ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deep @-@ believing and heart @-@ loving people , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could also do something to a fly .
I regularly get into contact with him , how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his registration , visit him regularly , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him until today that he was once strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of his dom@@ es are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect to which they still look up today and which they almost worship .
and please , again quite clearly : all that is being presented to him are educational methods that were then on the order of the day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can be glad we have long overcome this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is only too obvious the evil intent that is behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the report that has just been published reli@@ eves him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the dec@@ ency would stop , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one would probably know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , at last in peace .
