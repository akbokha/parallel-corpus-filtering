<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren institution, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, where it is excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card Munich promotes exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, because the Navi car instead of a bypass road showed a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the state government, are far from topical, but very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread-area of Munich's Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that you can't recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">More detailed maps, so-called author flyers, were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were made according to the Bavarian surveying business between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Her client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon asked for an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops were finally pulled off with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, they were the present-day neighbours, who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern-map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV founded the project further, founded the Topographic Bureau - and thus the Bavarian State veying business.</seg>
<seg id="19">The leaflet for Munich dates back to the year 1856 and is, like all others, to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded in the Munich suburb 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings were concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a small-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-written numbered batons from the so-called "premiere" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "small plots there are no more farmers there - but small gardeners of the" "" "" "" "land in the sun" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area lies north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, which has been the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact a meadow - and no concrete jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of the present-day district Au-Haidhausen one reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or from the rise "Auf der Lünen" - but also in big letters "Irren Schulalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, one once locked people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">There, in 1858 / 59, the Munich-based circle Irrenanstalt "Auf der aux Lüften" was created.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist, related to the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he was advanced for his time and ended, for example, the anchor of the so-called Irren." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibited the personnel from applying force against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">There was room for 280 patients, later it was extended to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was insufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar Amper Hospital Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been located there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet at the Munich Salesianum on the grounds of the former prison institution.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in an architectural reference to the original construction of the Irrenanstalt which was destroyed during the Second World War during bomb attacks.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was listed as "main square" in 1856, the Kaufinger street was called "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944, the Allies bombed many holes in the inner city.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn Strange will take place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich card with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Union for the Promotion of Farms has issued a warning for colorful people travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for Missouri, which is scheduled to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls on afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to take special attention when travelling by the state, as a number of dubious, rapid-based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here," says the group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri that makes people harder to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's prosecution authorities, who disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to release the warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights, which happen to people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard before." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited occurrences such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the journey by the state and taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report from the Office of the Missouri Attorney General in which it is shown that black motorists in the state will keep 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "" "" "Chapel said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "people must be ready if they bring deposits or let relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report programme, which ranks the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States had passed immigration laws that obligate local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have acted as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weidezaunproject is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">"" "" "" "the" "" "" "" "Fischerbacher Weidefence project" "" "" "" "is a successful project and will continue next year." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members of the German Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac made a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU township together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met at the pivotal cemetery of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first provided an insight into his operation, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses the Feriengaeste in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "" "" "the" "" "" "" "Schwarzwaldmilch" "" "" "" "is the alternative-free marketing pathway for the milk of its cows," says Schwendemann. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste only regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">As he is also BLHV-President of Fischer-bach, he called the WeidezaunProject as "Elemental important."</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I cannot manage on such steep faces." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="76">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "grassland area care for a lot of work, much needs to be worked with the brushcutter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," "" "" "" "said Schwendemann." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental farm and engaged it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if it did not conduct a bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the pasture" "" "" "" "and is glad about the leaders" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the areas could be dragged down for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to continue their operations," "" "" "" "the mayor pointed out." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "farmers are often criticised for funding because of funding." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven entrants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The surface area is 40 hectares, which can not be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 Euros, half of them were promoted through leaders, a quarter carried the village of Fisherbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers remained 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "" "" "explained Schwendemann." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac emphasized: "you do a really good job, without farmers and farmers."</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "" "" "also for Peter Weiss it stood firm:" "" "" "" "here the best foods are produced." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) Baden-Wuerttemberg allows the state support of fence-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The precondition is the presence of a conveyortage described by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area to be fenced must not be tractor-operated (inclination over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fisherman bacher WeidezaunProject 2018, the motion of eight participants with 24 parcels, who would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="96">The surface of the event corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">"" "" "" "now the White House of Trump is taking up the Statue of Liberty" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the careful downfall of Saddam Hussein on the Firdo square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN about the president's proposals for the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller does not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators would have aspired him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it grasped its importance, and in particular the importance attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta said, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "" "" "the poem that you refer to is added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your arms, and your afflicted masses who yearn to breathe freely, and the miserable rubbish of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "" "" "there was never a time when the" "" "" "" "miserable garbage" "" "" "" "on our screens was better to see." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict, because of the significance of a statue, is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took up a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn, traditional imagery.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus had changed the significance of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The Great Write Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is no one, but rather an early neo-conservative one that brings the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "" "" "the torch should not shine the way to the United States." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh came across something quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the viewpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch is not meant to enlighten the way, but to ignite the hatred which is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="150">The team captain said that she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a big honor anyway, but knowing that my team-mates had voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>

<seg id="259">An existing movement that stirred up the independence of Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.</seg>
<seg id="260">In 2003 the province was officially split in Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprised the eastern part of the island.</seg>

<seg id="270">But it is also Indonesia's golden country.</seg>
<seg id="271">The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="272">In 2015 alone, Freeport decomposes gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="273">In addition, the export of wood resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="274">These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua that ensure that Indonesia's powerful military has a suffocating presence.</seg>
<seg id="275">An investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport's local military units and units paid nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 US dollars to one single officer.</seg>
<seg id="276">Papuan aspirations for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.</seg>
<seg id="277">According to activists, more than 500,000 have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army since 1969.</seg>
<seg id="278">Massacres in Papuas's tribal land in the 1970 "s were genocide in accordance with the Asia Rights Commission.</seg>

<seg id="281">"it is difficult to count the number of victims since incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.</seg>

<seg id="293">On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas carols in front of a campfire at Enotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.</seg>

<seg id="299">A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.</seg>
<seg id="300">About 1,000 young soldiers, women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.</seg>
<seg id="301">They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - imitating in circles and a bird song - from Papuas Mee Pago-tribe.</seg>
<seg id="302">Some protesters started throwing stones on police and military posts.</seg>
<seg id="303">When the mood was heated, a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: "if the masses are resisting more than three times, they shoot them dead," it says in an official TIME document that was not released by the local media.</seg>
<seg id="304">Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto district of Enotali, saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home.</seg>

<seg id="316">The news of the killings came only on the following day 'filtered' by Jakarta.</seg>

<seg id="346">Paniai was always a resting point for the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="347">The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the tribal family Mee, Moni, Dani and damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.</seg>
<seg id="348">Many joined the "Free Papua New Movement" (OPM), the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by firing sporadic attacks and kidnappings by Indonesian soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="349">Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="350">In response to this, in recent years thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai and arbitrarily taken into custody under the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty."</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never dive again.</seg>

<seg id="365">In addition, restrictions on the reporting of international media remain tense.</seg>
<seg id="366">At the beginning of the year French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given rare permission to film.</seg>
<seg id="367">According to Phelim Kine, the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokov's campaign to raise the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized.</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's unquiet eastern provinces of Papua and West papua: visa denial and a black list," he said in an explanation.</seg>
<seg id="369">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Papuas." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="371">Historically, the same countries have supported the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">The speaker of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Arrmanhaa Nasir, rejected the allegations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta: "in Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights attacks."</seg>

<seg id="376">"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, Chairman of the Tribal Council.</seg>

<seg id="408">Less than 1 percent said they were late discovered that they had mistakenly gone with firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also stated that younger travellers were more likely to ignore the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">Of those surveyed who have knowingly attempted to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared with less than 15 percent, the members of Generation X.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common items that were intentionally passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 percent said to have knowingly worn items with blades by security control while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents affirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the plane.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said it questioned travellers all over the country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggling goods by airport security and how many would have done it deliberately.</seg>
<seg id="414">It is no surprise that people who are the most likely smugglers - knowingly or unknowingly - carry the safety of those who fly the most.</seg>

<seg id="424">In the past few months, Musk frequently had the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery just begins.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk is dreaming: of the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 had already been withdrawn again.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds) "reservation payment" completely back.</seg>
<seg id="428">At present 45,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem so far.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">2018 - all models will be taken together - 500,000, 2020 million.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 bookings per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you order a Model 3, you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new, never-tested production lines with maximum capacity utilisation without any major interruptions.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">If delays occur, then the liability of the reservations might become a problem for Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="438">Because then the company cannot prevent discontented customers from running away in droves.</seg>
<seg id="439">EPA Chairman Pruitt goes back on account of delaying the Obama-Era's rules to reduce emissions</seg>
<seg id="440">A day after he was sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the environmental protection authority, took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce the emissions of smoke-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the changes that his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the lawsuit brought against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">This deadline expires on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 ozone standards.</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance with a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was prosecutor of Oklahoma before being appointed by President Donald Trump, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly been forced to block or delay regulations aimed at preventing or delaying the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Prupp regulatory rolling back agenda." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that its reversal in ozone standards would simply reinforce the willingness of EPA to co-operate with states due to the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet deadlines for implementation and then wait to set up the deadline for implementation," said Pruitt, who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in its previous job. "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="452">"" "" "" "we also take the law and authority that gives us serious." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="453">However, the EPA statement said that at some point, Pruitt will use its "authority to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the regulations "are based on a solid policy and the best available information."</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive reform of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure has not yet been set up in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York Public Prosecutor, Eric Schneiderman, who led the Coalition of States that had accused the EPA this week, said the Group intends to maintain the legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"the conversion of the EPA - according to our lawsuits - is an important gain in the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.</seg>
<seg id="459">New York joined in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvanien, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumble celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery site in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16 at 4: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Beneficent Serenade can be charmed by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made TumblLine friends and sponsors a concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "" "" "Walter Martini emphasises:" "" "" "" "it is a unique village gem." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergische forgiven: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumble, including Vogtei, to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the certificate, on the tumble mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a magnificent courtyard, to which the church or the patronage belonged and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were people there too.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the district of Freudenstadt from 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" the third, the magnificent population centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around 1600 underscore these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The patronage law arose from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, refunded and occupied with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Connected with this was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two shatter on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly-created bell then rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed out later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were hammered and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796, French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and the church seats and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">During the New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm broke out the church tower and half of it collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the present tower of Turmzwerg remained a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kellberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the Hilarius system by Dieter Dockhorn as successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">The organisers invite the friends and sponsors of Tumarc on Sunday, July 16, for the sixth serenade to the old cemetery for the St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of Kepler Grammar Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 16.30.</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Boisheim defends itself" "" "" "" "does not see any legal requirement for construction and therefore has turned to the council." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim defends itself" has called on District Councillor Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen only a wind force concentration zone existed at the border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">In this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are possible in principle, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent "parraction" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">Although the city Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days earlier, but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved, because of a form failure.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the approved allowance is still unlawful and therefore also take back," "" "" "" "said Christoph Erkens, president of" Boisheim defends itself. "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: before the summer break, the City Council once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "Erkens:" "" "" "" "this makes it possible to grant permission for the construction of wind turbines on schedule." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="516">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the corresponding letters have been received by the circle of Viersen for past weeks," "" "" "" "declared a spokesman." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes it as an opportunity to reconsider the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argumentation of the association "Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a new subsidiary of the NEW, plans the construction of four wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the town Viersen participates indirectly, had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the establishment of the four wind turbines, the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered - this corresponds to around one-fifth of the power demand of all four-seater households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer Viersen's city councillor gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Linnich near Aachen, as well as participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the Kreis Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="532">In September, Bad Langensalaer and people from the region will rediscover shopping in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="533">The trade association and the municipal administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to lure the inhabitants of shopping in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="534">As the president of the Gewerbeverein, Christian König announced, the "Heimat-Shoppy" weekend is to sensitize customers for the offers that offer their own city away from the usual supermarket product.</seg>
<seg id="535">A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned, similar to the weekly market.</seg>
<seg id="536">In addition, domestic companies should present themselves with their apprenticeships.</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition, the shops of the city centre are supposed to invite you to "midnight shopping."</seg>
<seg id="538">In doing so, the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the region.</seg>
<seg id="539">In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, says Christian King.</seg>
<seg id="540">The Municipal Administration and the Trade Union cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</seg>
<seg id="541">Thus the trade association and the city go into another stage of the project "Attractive downtown."</seg>
<seg id="542">This includes new offerings such as the first "active day" to the well-established Sunday, talks with all industrial advertisers and hosts, in order to move them to active participation.</seg>
<seg id="543">Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on that day are part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="544">In addition, customer potentials are to be re-developed or re-developed.</seg>
<seg id="545">These include spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But also many local people would have lost the city center while shopping.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end, all of them would have to contribute to enliven the city centre - up to the landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.</seg>
<seg id="548">In the spring, it was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network that was partly wide-spread.</seg>
<seg id="549">Birgit Streich, head of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Mühlhausen, announced that Germany's third "home shopping" day, five Thuringian cities, will take part.</seg>
<seg id="550">Next to Bad Langensalza this is Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.</seg>

<seg id="876">"now they can start the season almost with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, believes that the players from Aue might even be somewhat fresher, since they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a Ascension favorite in the bones.</seg>

<seg id="883">New results of the Swedish asylum-old application tests published</seg>
<seg id="884">The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, who have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years. however, not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish authorities for Forensic Medicine (medicinalverket) started carrying out tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">During the asylum procedure, they are said to make the assessment of age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Department (Migrationsverket) has been criticized for the appraisal of the correct age of some refugees who were minor.</seg>
<seg id="887">Up to now, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 tests and the Forensic Medicine Agency has published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person "may be 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">"" "" "" "in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person" "" "" "" "may be under 18." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are carried out only in cases where the person's age is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">According to Johan Göransson, Forensic Medicine Agency, results have been consistent over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="892">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are fairly constant," "" "" "" "he said the magazine The Local." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="893">The high percentage of cases the person has been judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that "suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">When the paper examined Svenska Dagbladet the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.</seg>
<seg id="896">The method of medical age assessment, in the x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="897">A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work encompasses the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see if they usually went through puberty sooner or later than usual.</seg>
<seg id="898">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="899">Assessing the biological age in this way is very uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="900">"" "" "" "if we can't say it, we shouldn't do as if we could," "" "" "" "he said to the Metro." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="901">However, Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests: "generally speaking, you can say that the risk of developing a child as an adult is low.</seg>
<seg id="902">The greatest risk is that if the person is under 18, this is about 10 per cent. "</seg>
<seg id="903">Full in the plan</seg>
<seg id="904">The work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is proceeding well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it's going super," "" "" "" "says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Road Construction and Traffic in the Presidency of Freiburg." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the works began at the same time on all three renovation needed bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the end of the project is scheduled for October and it is clear that the schedule will be met." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete that is covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">To ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning got a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a border fortification, which is also used as an operating road.</seg>
<seg id="919">A 2,20-metre wide bridge board is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway will take place.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing is that it is fabricated parts, a patent for the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">The laying of pipes through the structure in Lauterbach required a special sense of tact.</seg>
<seg id="924">There is also a fibre cable to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">In the run-up to the work, the residents were informed of the project by handouts.</seg>
<seg id="926">Fish and crustaceans had to be fished at first.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting point in the direction of Schramberg the traffic is regulated by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach village entrance, the road is completely closed in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden."</seg>
<seg id="929">The cost of the three bridge renovations is 700,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="930">The whole thing is financed by the country.</seg>

<seg id="948">There are about 200 listeners in the hall that wait for the top candidate for the election of the Bundestag, Alice Weidel, and the vice-president Beatrix of Storch to talk about their speeches.</seg>
<seg id="949">The police presence remains unchanged, but until now the officials had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="950">The AfD-event takes a little more than an hour, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there shortly after 21 o'clock.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the Fiscal Rules of the football match Neymars Moving to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending on European football clubs are not bothered by Neymars's world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from entering the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules established in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG will eventually prove that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to expel the Brazilians out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make money easy for Neymar to sign and bring it to a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the power-rich marshal family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but have to interact with legitimate revenue sources that allow them to point the break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini for his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - purchased a club with potential and then invested heavily in improving the team and building a global brand - should become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current triennial FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">Even though Platini has fallen from the presidential election in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to scare away from excessive expenses.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, against The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it may distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the sales revenues for the next five years can be recorded in the annual financial statements of 44.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has met the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues from companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Qatar company could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsoring was to exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not allow this to be considered to be legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was inflated by Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could be made by payments of the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 denied that Neymar WWM ambassadors are being sent and that such manoeuvres for UEFA regulators might be easy to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, said Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last financial year still need to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG anticipates that Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymars passing by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the president of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's last owner to PSG.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sport tycoons, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association.</seg>
<seg id="1155">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is the consequence of the ownership and that has changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," "" "" "" "said Wenger on Thursday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1156">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "once a country has an association, everything is possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1157">It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fairplay because one can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country. "</seg>
<seg id="1158">Swiss is looking for a new shock supplier</seg>
<seg id="1159">In recent years Chocolat Frey has produced chocolate for Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the sweet cooperation stands before a possible end: the airline is rewriting the order.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Swiss-Speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency SDA a corresponding report of the newspaper "Northwestern Switzerland" of Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"we are very happy with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="1165">Around 17 million small red-white packed shocks of 14 grams distribute the flight attendants every year before landing to the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="1166">Swiss didn't want to give any information about the costs.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Industry insider appreciates the volume of orders in "Northwestern Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of approximately 1 billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But even more important is the advertising effect: for a shock manufacturer it is a prestigious order.</seg>
<seg id="1169">Swiss Life does not want to disclose how many applicants are involved in the new tender.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey hopes to revise the agreement on spring 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the SDA, the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Swiss Life has been distributing chocolate bars on board their flights since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Before the Swiss made a contract with Migros's daughter Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.</seg>
<seg id="1175">Swiss made it possible to place the logo at the start of cooperation with Chocolat Frey two and a half years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1176">The airline is cooperating with various Swiss chocolate producers.</seg>
<seg id="1177">On long-haul flights, First Class customers are spoilt by the confectionery Sprüngli, Business Class scooters Schoggi from Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolat Frey.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80-s, for the 90-er-years Grunge era (as the pioneer David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for itself - that is, for 2001 before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd were going to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artefact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as a franchise it feels like time is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" surprisingly worked well, not only because of his absurd humour (it contained an original story for a promising ose vegetables, which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By grafting on the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play horny children who will grow up - but still manage to win back the last part of the Witzes.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his grown-ups who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more to the casting wheel principle, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 90 "s such as" The Hand That Rocks the Cradle "(" The Hand Picked the cradle ").</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point, a character bumps through an Apple-Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The gracious Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy-malignant plot, included in Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-successful impression by Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the exams are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's whiskers from "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">These are the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the band how to visit the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now remembers a different kind of nostalgia: to the revival of the Cold War from "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with his East versus West wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka is to be a bound TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are dubbed by Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it's not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice days to look at (the police spends time watching chess on TV as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides a decent game 'find out the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes, the comedy ensues, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective" which was edited down to a lower length could better deliver its agitprop satire, since Gregor and Iosef are constantly revisiting the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men, who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food for a purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs.</seg>

<seg id="1290">NHS (The National Health Service) should prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people</seg>
<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in front of the High Court against the funding of the drug in NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep), which may reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1293">He agreed to finance the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, according to which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the allegation that the local authorities should fund it.</seg>
<seg id="1294">The move announced on Thursday was greeted by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention," while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described this as a "decisive moment."</seg>
<seg id="1295">Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable registration of people, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1296">Prep prophylaxis (prep) is a consequence of HIV agents that are taken prior to sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Those who question the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated.</seg>
<seg id="1301">In clinics we identify suitable candidates who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered by a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will sign £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive purchase.</seg>
<seg id="1304">The study aims to evaluate the full potential of prep by collecting and implementing clinical evidence as used on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "" "" "Stevens said:" "" "" "" "this grand new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1309">From September on people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is genuinely controlled and not subject to negotiations with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, moved from a big house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne tells.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "" "" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne closet space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "" "" "that was my request," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the Architectural and Designstudio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the steel works are quite complicated," "" "" "" "he explains." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">It was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with plenty of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to allow it to work for longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">By perceiving a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a bit of engineering went in," "" "" "" "says Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF-door." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is mutual so that when you push the door, it is very easy." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," "" "" "" "says Erfan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxury advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and which help to create an emotional bond in a home," "" "" "" "says Erfan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "" "" "these are important, but they don't play with your heart." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself by good design and increased square metrics of something standard in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you might decide to not leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for 500 million US dollars real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in an exploration of one of the largest real estate imperial Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Former director of the 'Carlton-Football Club' and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how her property and business assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp controversy over the separation will take place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have acquired 38 real estate in the value of more than half a billion dollars, since the family bought a store in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew up in a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and De LUTIS's portfolio now includes offices in the Stadtzenrum, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Following an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul as the "main operator and the dominating personality" in the De LUTIS family - has about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court record says that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The allocation of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the detachments proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "" "" "he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle to control the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to incompetently manage some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," "" "" "" "he wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the case of hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and two parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Ms. De LUTIS and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicatessen in the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the first Jeandas of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of High School when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De LUTIS says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property on to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "" "" "" "she wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS group of companies, wherein Colin claims that Mark has paid $10 million in leaving the company and hatch 26 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "" "" "both Luke and Mark were," "" "" "" "Paul says" "" "" "" "about the terms of their financial separation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Only Colin responded by SMS to say "I can really not say much" because the case is in front of the courts.</seg>

<seg id="1388">New Chief of Staff is planning to limit the media abstinence of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive employees on his first day of work, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump White House he wanted to repair: bad information that was getting into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relationship with television reaches decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television commercials are still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of positions that were too convincing," said former election campaigner Sam Nunberg in February compared to Polco.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Political Cocos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump Twitter wont be under control, according to six former election campaign officials, to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lobbying."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "" "" "but the idea that Trump Twitter" "" "" "" "was ever" "" "" "" "under control" "" "" "" "is ridiculous." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know about others - that Trump tweets couldn't contain any more combustible material without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff managed to keep his anger away from him a few times, then their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are always trying to present their own agenda by presenting Trump materials that possibly promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "politico - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to supply questionable information to the president for strategic reasons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with shameful cheques, and that he braves to find out where they originate.</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously accused the president of a printed copy of an article from Gottw.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy treasurer Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter for harassment, or that he has not offered concrete evidence or that he has made false allegations in the past and has revoiced them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "" "" "Trump was reading the article and began asking people about Walsh." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Gold-maker added that the former Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus and General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork and to document the Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still strive for influence.</seg>

<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadl is currently being renovated and will be re-opened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof in the then ambiente company gesellschaft mbH from April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and income from the tourist tax was also lost.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the autumn of 2014, the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter in the context of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees, which caused controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: United States Special Offers Announces Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, special agent Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The Panel resumed its work in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal calling on people familiar with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller had extended and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">CNN reported that there were already first invitations from the Committee in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of interfering with the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were discussions between Trump campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation will focus on several men acting as advisors to the Republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller took a closer look at more and more Trump's private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Trump personally moved to the center and asked whether the president could have impeded the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to apply an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand juries are also called the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to charge persons under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to CNN, invitations have already been issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who participated in the meeting were asked to make a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trump advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election campaign manager Paul Manafort took part in the interview.</seg>
<seg id="1498">On Thursday evening, legal experts said that the substitution showed that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">It does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up in the end to decide on the charging of an accusation.</seg>
<seg id="1500">However, the establishment of the committee is the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affairs as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "" "" "said Trump." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "" "" "the theme gives the Democrats a chance to" "" "" "" "feel good" "" "" "" "because they have nothing else they can talk about." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this also usually works in secret, he emphasised.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the White House welcomes any measures that accelerated the work of the" "" "" "" "fair" "" "" "" "way." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "former FBI chief James Comey said three times that he will not be determined against the President." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something has changed, it continued to be explained in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump Comey had fired up.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "because of this draft, accusations against Trump have become loud, he has obstructed the judiciary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June in front of a senate committee, Trump asked him for an investigation of the investigations against the National Security Advisor Michael Flynn at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the representation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this triggered speculation about whether Trump Meller wanted to release Mueller." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair, around the later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the behest of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of republican and democratic senators presented lawsuits on Thursday, after which the investigator could no longer be dismissed as easily.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the Western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of the barely seven-fold size of Berlin was solved by the ice shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This shared the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The Koloss, which weighs over a trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving to the north and will probably need two, three years until it has melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that have registered researchers over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1524">It is unclear to what extent climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg.</seg>
<seg id="1525">The US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a facsimile leaves the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) for about 30 years.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus was part of the Larsen-C ice shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelhos swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C ice shelf lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this horseshoe the balance of waxing and abrupt was disturbed a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a complete ice shelf can be broken down there," "" "" "" "writes AWI research scientist Daniela Jansen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is some evidence that the Larsen-C scarf file is in danger, as the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate stands under tension and can decay if a piece breaks down at a key location.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of ice and ice does not increase the level of sea level as they float on the water and put ice as much water as it follows after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a limited extent, the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas) writes.</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C ice shelf is the fourth biggest ice shelf in Antarctica, with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is the most sweeping retreat since the beginning of records," "" "" "" "he also confirmed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists, whether the Larsen-C ice shelf will grow again or fall back on a long-term basis and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, "Our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these scientists do not relinquish the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, there have been a lot of ice-snuggings in the Antarctic Peninsula in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Over the last 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has been warming up around three degrees and thus persist in areas where the temperature is fastest growing.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants a house tariff at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU claims to withdraw from the employers "association in order to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Just before the summer break, the District Day saw 41 new jobs in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1,100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>

<seg id="1555">The courses in the circle are obviously very sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">There were around 620 applications for the places to be found this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle continues to lack staff in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present, there are still 50 non-occupied places at the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as general administration are sought.</seg>

<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term demands for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orient itself internally and externally, demonstrate concrete measures for cross-entrants and involve a training initiative, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "" "" "the speech is of a" "" "" "" "competition of public employers" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1574">In this way, the CDU tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually foresees the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are available only if you move to a higher level oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more over the past few years.</seg>

<seg id="1579">Italy exacerbates the tone of NGO Migrants Rescue Boots</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs who use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, that they should not continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "when NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said interior minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came one day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organization 'Youth Rettet' because their crew worked effectively with traders in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express the detailed accusations of Ambrogio Cartosio in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue area at the moment," "" "" "" "said the organisation in a statement on the social media." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we can only judge all accusations currently raised after collecting all the information and assessing the situation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew will take dinghy migrants on board, which will be supplied to them directly by traffickers, and that smugglers can go off so that they can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least such a meeting occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor of the prosecutor, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The crew is suspected of overshadowing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must first of all have an Italian police officer on board, who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any "significant changes or disabilities" of their rescue operations.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign up is the Nobel Prize laureate organization Médecins sans Frontières (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">In the meantime, Minniti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has fallen sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "" "" "said the minister." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berliner Ouposts" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the northern Pfalz for four days to enjoy Trials and sights.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burg- und Weinfest von Wachenheim was a welcome bonus.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led with hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far across the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there was always longer ascents, for the long trials rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the folk festival sausage market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again, lookout point reached the lookout point, connected by "flowiga" trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">There were many altimeters on the last two days.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shelters brought welcome breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers atted a healing brine in the open air inhalatorium.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>

<seg id="1613">Will the sport stars continue to sit in front of computer consoles, instead of being sweaty in the wind and weather over stadium racing?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact: e-Sport has long since become a serious industry, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gaits included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">This has also recognised the first German people who are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified for example.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen has now consulted an agency for virtual footballers.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14-30-year-olds in particular that young people will go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all markets, especially the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under contract, it is possible to be present online much more often on these markets than to send the Bundesliga to Asia only once a year.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">When it comes to e-sport, computer games such as League Of Legends, "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or even FIFA's soccer simulation are challenged at a competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, Ligen has long since established itself, in which the pros are competing against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the Asian Games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbing has also been dealing with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sport - for example, increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also needs cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Controls are difficult for online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist highlights the high integrative effect of E-Sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">The players are on the international road, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the company consultants Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This means that in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">Sales at 130 million are expected in three years.</seg>
<seg id="1644">There is little against the 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, the e-sport is not far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "the Deloitte consultants write.</seg>
<seg id="1646">Many countries are already on the international level.</seg>

<seg id="1699">So those who have been chosen to inherit the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation.</seg>
<seg id="1700">Kimoto confirmed: "this is what you want as a player: take responsibility."</seg>

<seg id="1703">And at all Kimme worked in this initial formation as the one who can take the helm in his hand.</seg>

<seg id="1705">He had the view for the whole while many others were busy with himself.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Vidal tried to overplay his missing fitness (barely collapsed); Renato Sanches thus, on the devil, come out of the services of the Asia trip (collapsed also conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle did not negatively fall into their first appearance in Bayern-Trikot.</seg>
<seg id="1707">After all, it worked very well.</seg>
<seg id="1708">Süle ran beside Kimche, Rudy in front of the defense, both acted sovereign.</seg>

<seg id="1726">It often became irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.</seg>
<seg id="1727">This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V-demand of a change in economic policy - and simultaneously tadell the old minister.</seg>
<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "Frank natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer companies (VTU), says:" "" "" "" "Wissing attacks the desires of the economy that Lemke has all blocked." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">The biggest turnaround sees natus in the infrastructure policy: the gap between the highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the priority list of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1731">This year the ministry hopes to set up a planning process, until 2021 is to be the right to build up the building.</seg>
<seg id="1732">A role in the plans of the country also alludes to the westward encroachment of Trier, which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Plan.</seg>
<seg id="1733">The aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020, says Ministerial spokesman Cornelia Holtmann.</seg>
<seg id="1734">Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional, but internationally competitive companies.</seg>
<seg id="1735">The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier is seeking, as by Wissing, a Rhineland-Palatinate-label to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports declining for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to create their own company, praises the Chamber of Commerce.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The Handwerkskammer Trier is looking for an additional incentive for young apprentices in the new master bonus, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.</seg>
<seg id="1738">A premium of 1000 Euro is foreseen for the passed master test and 2500 Euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of master training.</seg>
<seg id="1739">But the homework list for the country remains long.</seg>
<seg id="1740">According to Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK).</seg>
<seg id="1741">Up to now, 56 new engineers, who want to employ Wissing in the state business, have only been occupied for 29 jobs.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The Chamber is calling for more orders to be awarded to external offices.</seg>
<seg id="1743">Christian Baldauf's CDU vice-president, Christian Baldauf, refers to calculations of the Court of Auditors, the country has invested more than 20 million euros in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Frank natus also expects a concept of the country to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1745">The former broadband expansion in the country is also sobering.</seg>
<seg id="1746">In 2016, regional companies had rated power supply in an IHK survey with a score 3.4.</seg>
<seg id="1747">They complained about stagnant internet connections and breakthroughs.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi BMW said that it would offer to update the software to more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW president said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," and thus moved to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and may cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of the car manufacturers to install systems for neutralising exhaust fumes from diesel vehicles also increases, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of forsaking the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shutdowns which regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but driving back in normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">In the United States, several Volkswagen employees were accused, others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">The former manager, Zacchao Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after having accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States has been expanded.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The involvement of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the benefit of Volkswagen.</seg>

<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he worked as a draughtsman for greetings cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough in the late 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in Paris Match, and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">Lavender is declining because of drought-recalling conditions and insect-carrying insects, which causes scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions, causing severe headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is highly endangered since the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years, which has resulted in much less rainfall in the spring and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cichade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are very many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much at stake.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil attracts not only for holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">"" "" "" "so we have less parts with essential oil." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.</seg>

<seg id="1809">Assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they are to take their children into the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from violence, and while throughout the country the corpses are accumulating, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25 years since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her publisher and her inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "" "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere present - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hanging on the facade of the Riodolce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special commission was established in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of killings linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the killers are rarely tried by journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In the case of Feodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little benefit to the discussion of security," "" "" "" "says Ibarra." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "as long as we don't know why, we all strust." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15 Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with "twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the road or that the graveyard is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kingdoms that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling antitrust groups in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have angered the sons, suspected gang members bought any copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez not to leave the country for his own security after confiscating another newspaper which had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for the Norosts in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to the foundation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "" "" "in Sinaloa," "" "" "" "it was impossible to pursue journalism without encountering the toxicity problem," "" "" "" "said Bojorquez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the paper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish highly accurate research without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the foundation of Feodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez gained the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it was leading.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ Award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "" "" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "" "" "is a way of life," "" "" "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you have to take over the task assigned to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "" "" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The odolce team measures Valdez, the fun-bird, who could curse like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his ruin?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret starting and landing ways" "" "" "" "to move drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells bad, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of the Feodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happens to Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">Days before it became known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters were wondering if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen, who the governor described as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodoce was on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of ex-known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to the state expenditures, which concentrated on the governor's home town.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that conducted a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which ruled nearly the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of corruption for high-profile cases.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, readers would have viewed the column of Valdez as the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "before we knew what happened," "" "" "" "said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed" "" "" "" "El Flaco" "" "" "" "because of his slim body style." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was rededicated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few notes and went next morning to a demonstration due to a further journalist in the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In the whole country journalists have grown loudly by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is in Washington and attempts to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and letting them kill them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since then asked her to be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a uniform society.</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with the organised crime.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Last year, the media guard group "Articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Mexico you die because they want you to hold your mouth," "" "" "" "said Ramirez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note that was said to have been signed by the Zetas Kartell: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>

<seg id="1923">At first sight it looks like a statue, though a frightening.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the unbelievable Nashore of a Canadian miner have been so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so well received that they could even notice that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a "restless past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in the journal "Current Biology" described it as "the best-preserved dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of nocturaurs living in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">Its incredibly well-preserved state amazes researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to National Geographic reports, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossils of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Radio when he grub 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossils discovered by him were sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy soil.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it slept," said the author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs copies - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, although it is covered with armor and resembles a walking tank, probably was threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counterpart, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed him to better mix in his surroundings and evade his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodo aurier made headlines in May and is now shown in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armors over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter shading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its base.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaurs were hunted by eating dinosaurs by eating carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals campaigning against shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than booty, which signals that this Nodo-rier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "strong predator behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the circle have been," said Brown. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal for evidence about his life, including his preserved intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and driven out into the sea, where he sunk on his back to the seabed.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as South florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much farther inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this nodose-dinosaur is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early circle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you just squash a bit with your eyes, you could almost believe that he's going to sleep. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons weighty monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings are published in Current Biology, believe that after death, Borealopelta was sunk and mummified in the mud after death.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Radio when he grub 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is completely from muzzle to hips.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that were raging from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the fortified plant-eater was swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hautroste still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as' rarely as a gain in the lotto.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right foot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A8: almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous injured, kilometres long stalls - and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">About 20 people were injured on the Stuttgart-München (A8) motorway on the late afternoon of Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the first data of the police, around 17.00 o'clock between the junctions Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district) during a thunderstorm, almost 30 vehicles, among them probably trucks, crashed into each other.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The exact number of injured lags initially lacked data.</seg>
<seg id="1977">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is a matter of mild to moderate injuries," "" "" "" "said a police spokesman." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">A ten-kilometre back-stau was formed in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1981">As reported by an AZ journalist, there was also a massive handicap on the counter-track - due to numerous Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade was writing down the characteristics of the vehicle handlebars, who now have to reckon with sensitive penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 p.m. a second accident took place on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group tests "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: nothing in the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffalo.</seg>

<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are over soon.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the paperless ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and use it to validate your ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">There is currently a test run on two tracks.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if the offer arrives, we will expand it." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1999">To be able to use them, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It also has to be purchased via the web app, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"" "" "" "for the" "" "" "" "comfort check-in" "" "" "" "works like this: one goes into the train, calls his ticket to" My tickets "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2004">The test customers then form a button for the electronic devaluation.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train companions receive a notification on their mobile devices, that passenger X is in the train and has taken the reserved seating place Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the train attendant arrives at the ticket inspector in place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">One can therefore continue to sleep, continue to work, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the railway - which in turn should use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to travel without ticket control by our train service personnel, please check the DB Navigator yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal, "says Michael Peterson, DB Fernverkehr's Marketing Management Board.</seg>
<seg id="2011">"" "" "" "second Plus:" "" "" "" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who travel often know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are among the biggest annoyances.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often you have, in any case, one of the fellow travelers not having all the documents you need to degrade online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to poor mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling their own tickets and takes the conductor at the end time to take care of other matters.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this is only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Additional concise numbers on the same route are not yet activated.</seg>
<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after she arrived in New York City, she was sitting in St. Louis Geborene on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the police had just killed an 18 year old child and it still lies on the street," "" "" "" "he said there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, as no one else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly rescued at her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was to tweets the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns's lifeless body which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "that's wild," Ferrell thought. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She laid off her cell phone to return later in the evening to Tweets about people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people shouting, and of a man who claimed to be a father's father who wore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson police killed just my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed in which a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "" "" "in another video, she said, another policeman secured his gun and cried:" "" "" "" "I will kill you... animals kill everyone." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is not common," "" "" "" "Ferrell recalled their statement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder we get used to and that we can call typical." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"" "" "" "I was angry and cried." "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 11am she picked up her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened over the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance which consists of the people's point of view, who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell came to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a fitting crown, the two talked a conversation, which they had innumerable times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "" "" "she remembered what she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are now going to Ferguson, because the police killed an 18 year old boy and that wasn't right." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">"" "" "" "I could not take them with me," "" "" "" "said Ferrell later." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2046">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "what has happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do in order to be free to liberate ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, she is not different from the next black female child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "" "" "I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp site when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Chief Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed completely after August 9," she said, and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I had no experience in organizing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2057">It's all coming. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">One question came Ferrell in the sense: "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often whites - in a community profiting from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "" "" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview," "" "" "" "We heard that people who were born and grown up in Ferguson did not have their votes centered and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had worked together with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestraked inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we talk," "" "" "" "said Davis." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "that was the main thing for me as these people are represented, for so I will be represented." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferris's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, Whose Streets do show personal aspects of Ferris's life as she falls in love with her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "" "" "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanisation of black people." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferris's story repeated the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who, after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin, marked the film "Blackmagic Matter" in social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black women in leadership positions took the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "" "" "black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "" "" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "" "" "the movement is really held by black women and many black women." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">It insists however that "this is not an affirmative type of action," when Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "she was the person who shook this energy," "" "" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is no accident, although she was at the forefront, because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman stands so much on the game." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">"" "" "" "you can feel their energy through the screen." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2080">In the meantime, the security cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking an autobahn at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless, she clings to a song and she feels bound to this memory ever since she went to the street three years ago in Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to megalomania: TV readers are discussing bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit-gallery moves people even though they haven't been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian precinct cleaves the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly leaves the subject cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit gallery says: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "no man needs" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While advocates build that a gallery draws more customers into the city, including the rest of the business, the opponents fear that the pedestrian precinct bleeds.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is being planned right on the property on which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will be concluded.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Galerie-Macher want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda-Platz with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "for many years we have been shopping in the farmer's market hall almost every week.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cake of the farm women again and again very much.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities, there are also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing resides in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but this might not be very low in the new project." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what's a shopping list in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I think it is superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough of it in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not yet a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there is fresh, mostly sold directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only leased by larger companies, because the rentals there are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, specialty stores almost no longer exist and what is left of it will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the farmers market hall be during the construction period?</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost unnoticeably similar - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagleborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst had a 35-year prison sentence after being classified as secret diplomacy about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Stresemblance (a matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg who discipline her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transgressman and a pioneering dissident whose condemnation was turned into Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">By algorithmic analysis of DNA that was extracted from Manning and created out of 30 portraits, Dewey-Hagborg developed a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born in Bradley Edward but openly talked about the identification as a woman since its puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Her image was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie where Manning is obviously sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from trash to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," declared Dewey-Hagborg during a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned mice became unequal friends who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "Suppo Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea would enact judgment and would be able to personally see the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually only a few days after the book was published, the release of Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of lucky coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he should fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said "things can happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Manning demanded an end to the "automatic fragmentation based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">With the inclusion of the 200 characters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), Dewey-Haglöv hoped to show how astonishing similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own space, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she emerges with a free-talk efon in his hand from the United States disciplinary teams like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "when they put your words in the cold, they won." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "so never stop the mouth." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "" "" "" "said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2153">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I still get goosebumps when I talk about it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from her own genomic simulations, which gather together like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also aimed at everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning's stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," "" "" "" "said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2159">A countrywide chase is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University, who are sought as suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, for Wyndham Ladies (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, such as the acts of the Cook County Local Court.</seg>

<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>

<seg id="2192">Mutkos's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with the Russian sales agency rsport at the beginning of the day Smirnov had problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful, or worse - deceiving.</seg>
<seg id="2206">Even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there simply never existed consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources Start-up race is on the rise to help companies find out how their staff feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, provide special groups and demographics groups, provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers to circumvent the C-Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee involvement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Salvation said that they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys of certain teams, it provides a heat map of the company which shows at a glance which units have the most ailments and which managers have low containment results so that you can rebove, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are expected to remain at the forefront of workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber wrapped in scandals ever since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like GLINT this wish is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance business could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial technical website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber-Foot in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">CH has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like GLINT, Converents lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, which enables employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the main business leader is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the court of public opinion has captured the regulator," "" "" "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company finds its employees poorly treated or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a timid and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to pursue the complaints of staff.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company uses Converents, problems that have previously been hidden by executives who have been sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practications - can be identified and addressed more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view of the experience with employment," "" "" "" "said Vitrano, who leads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employee Engagement in 2002 seriously after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed due to ethical infringements by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry going online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as a service, and debit the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital Investors that have supported both start-ups." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2236">Cent earned $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised the entire capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitterern secured himself $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and raised his entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only assignments.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want to have the feeling that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"when people are happy to be in a company that has heard their voices, and that the work that you do is worth it, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, both used both Convercent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors achieve yields when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data about employee engagement in the workplace culture experts is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the management of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come fast enough or not at all, disappointments can raise and hire employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting with the Business Management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for if you do not follow co-workers wondering," "" "" "" "Have you really heard me?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "" "" "and if you don't care, why should I?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported about GLINT, such as Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights into employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better engagement of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2304">He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, and talked with fellow countrymen, gardeners and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "" "" "then, at night he drank" "" "" "" "Whiskey and started to write." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access only in 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees just began to look after the archive which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said," Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps showing what he owned: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch to fight the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let everything go its way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on a broader base in English history, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book called 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', Rhodes says.</seg>

<seg id="2313">"" "" "" "perhaps the two are interconnected?" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patter that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell was depicted from the 18th century, who staged his own burial by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was dug out).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney: "lords seemed to be quite crooks, always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell's men redeemed their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking boys, with a talent to advertise education. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his essay in the castle Rhodes is searching for other unique write experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämäki, the land of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.</seg>

<seg id="2337">Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army</seg>
<seg id="2338">Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) consults in Ankara on retirement and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So also this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting no longer took place in the building of the General Staff, as in the past, but in the office of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Under the head of the head of the government, the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Ministers also took part in the consultations.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Thus the civilians in the YAS were in the overpopulation.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government is moving the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the commander of the army, the air forces and the navy have been dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the reactor of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 people, who are supposed to have participated directly in the coup attempt, will be negotiated in Ankara since this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan declared the coup attempt as a "gift of God," as he gave him the opportunity to "completely clean the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have a grip on the army?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the paper Hürriyet published an article entitled "Unfury in the Military Headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the lifting of the headscarf for soldiers, wrote the paper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">In any case, the large-scale teaching of the army and the security forces continues.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July Erdogan issued another 7395 civil servants by decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were earlier than the actual lords of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they putted their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Following his election victory in 2002, Erdogan urged the military's power step by step, not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say that Erdogan is deliberately driving an Islamization of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the magazine "Vocal Europe," an especially unnamed officer, who sought asylum after a coup attempt in fear of persecution in foreign countries, warned the Turkish army in a few years "full extremists and Salafists."</seg>
<seg id="2362">If this is true, such a development could not allow Nato to be cold.</seg>
<seg id="2363">Anyway, in the alliance after cleansing, there is doubt about the commitment of the Turkish army.</seg>

<seg id="2368">The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.</seg>

<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the race track system in the long term, construction work will begin again this year according to the Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to further order and renovate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country commits itself to this particularly important link to tourism," explained Minister of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The costs for the repair of the track amounted to approximately EUR 2.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="2379">From this sum, the country surpasses 75 percent.</seg>

<seg id="2384">As a result, the Rennsteig Shuttle will be ordered regularly in December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a railway connection popular especially for tourists between the stations of Ilmenau and Rennsteig.</seg>
<seg id="2386">Over the past few months, during a pilot operation, it has been tested whether the route is used by a large number of people to order it regularly in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2387">The track is also strongly bungaled in parts.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots will come.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, a professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we have to start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of it, but companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey at the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford woman look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBuotix robot provides for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed Personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of timidity and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that matches your personality as best as possible," enthuses the True Companion website.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">During the day she also has her moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "" "" "it can be tired, be fixed on conversation or it can be" "" "" "" "in mood" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient feminine features, the allusions to rape if you take a step towards Frigid (i.e.: reluctant) Farrah, upset one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy was compared with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing sophistication are pointing towards something darker and deeper in our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjection as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR recognizes their rising popularity, they nevertheless remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps out of the edge areas can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting unless the free market gives them permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are threatened all over the world in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have sexually attacked women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the worn body and the stochastic eyes, but how realistically this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, when it comes to "personalities," the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no intermediation or background story, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total subjugation.</seg>
<seg id="2422">"" "" "" "in other words, they are false slaves." "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the phrasing of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trump great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US voters have divided families in small formats.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day in the USA there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all reportedly trying to blow up our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of trucks to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">For the dining table it is certainly a good thing, but it is in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the issuing power of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalisation" and trump, we refer to the ridiculous possibility that one day his kittens will no longer be discharged.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more startling long-term scenario in which Trump republicans of the right wing "normalizes," which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself covered by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% incomes tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both compared to Trump in fact a very mild criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York Parkdepartment, and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are extremely large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals twist in order to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-perishing music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city is not just the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Theme-Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a big roundabout in northern London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">But the Central Park-carousel is still a strange magic experience, as here two two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what is actually a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was excused, while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars.</seg>

<seg id="2525">Ll Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center.</seg>
<seg id="2526">This year singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and Norman Lear (95) were among the honorable singers.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The awards will be presented at the beginning of December.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will hold a reception and join with his wife Melania at the award ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The award winner Lear, who was introduced with progressive TV series, already announced that he would refrain from taking part in the gala.</seg>
<seg id="2530">"" "" "" "he said:" "" "" "" "this presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to evade them - and that burdened me." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2531">The 59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she will use Trump to clarify her point of view.</seg>
<seg id="2532">The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.</seg>
<seg id="2533">Among the earlier winners are Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.</seg>
<seg id="2534">We make the city life worth</seg>
<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslach's City Engineer, will retire next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The job is already written - however, suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been a city building master for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work makes him still great fun as he mediates in the press briefing.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successors.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it surprises him that so far no application has been satisfied with the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So - considering the regular termination periods - there should be enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach works for the administration community as an undere construction law office, the applicant has to show corresponding statements.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if they cannot fill in this, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2546">But citizen proximity is important to the city and it itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate and good mood between authority and citizen.</seg>
<seg id="2547">In more than 30 years in office, some major projects have been collected, looking back on the chipper with pride.</seg>
<seg id="2548">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we make the city life worth," "" "" "" "he is sure about the building department and its employees." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2549">But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla Areas and the Niederhofenparkplatz has been initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2550">The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the stadium renovation is still a topic.</seg>
<seg id="2551">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if we do it right," "" "" "" "Wacker estimates." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2552">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "all in all, great tasks await my successors." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2553">"" "" "" "the work here is fun." "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2554">For a city architect, there is a lot of room for design.</seg>
<seg id="2555">With Haslach's own building yard and nursery, we can react very flexibly to many things.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you can move a lot," "" "" "" "said Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2557">As the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye on what fits in," when new buildings are approved, the retiring Stadtbaumeister stresses.</seg>
<seg id="2558">Anyway, the City Engineer bears high responsability.</seg>
<seg id="2559">"" "" "" "he is a builder," "" "" "" "in the end everything runs over my table." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2560">In case of support and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been here for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">"" "" "" "Wacker wishes:" "" "" "" "we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere, but also for the further shaping of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">According to information provided by the city of Haslach, who would like to be buried under the supervision of Roland Wacker should be able to show a completed degree as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor's degree in Architecture and have good expertise in the fields of building arrangement and planning law.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Stadtbauamt (Stadtbauamt) are subject to civil engineering, civil engineering, building instruction, urban renewal, administration of urban properties, urban farming estate with a building court and urban gardening centre, as well as the Lower House of Construction Law, including preservation of monuments.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Bike thrown on lines: southern track closed</seg>
<seg id="2566">According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track system in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) to the lines.</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be halted.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go out of two male perpetrators and search for them since the night.</seg>
<seg id="2569">Near the crime scene, a rosemary scooter and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="2570">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this goes far beyond a Lausannois," "" "" "" "said EBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2571">The perpetrators brought themselves in great danger themselves and also jeopardized the train traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2572">In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the late-minute drive and the costs for rail substitution, Pönalen of the railway customers could also face the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2573">"" "" "" "overall, there was a" "" "" "" "considerable" "" "" "" "sum, the speaker said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2574">The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, the railway traffic on the Southern Railroad was possible without any hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="2575">Nearly ten people were missing Friday morning, two of them concerned the long distance traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2576">Freight trains did not invade, but they had a delay.</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in Great Britain causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinal system.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, said that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell is present in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their diet, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. Cross and a diet rich in tryptophan promote a more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal system if the same system works with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was investigating a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe who was however separate, did not have this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microcosa had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacteria species found in mice with the immune cells were found, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were brought up in a sterile environment, so that a intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they were given to the L. Cross and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria depended on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri left in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan-metabolism, known as the idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us L. Cross are protected in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestines." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">"" "" "" "potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. Cross can lead to an expansion of this population." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2604">Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a genius with Nemanja Matic</seg>
<seg id="2605">Manchester United signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder had his debut versus Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="2606">The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2: 1 win in Dublin, the last off-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder's role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira acted at will.</seg>
<seg id="2607">Matic, however, had been excluded from the pre-preparatory Asia tour of the blues and made only 45 minutes what Mourinho admits that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season.</seg>
<seg id="2608">"he needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.</seg>
<seg id="2609">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we will help him to be ready to be ready before." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2610">In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku entered the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho made his start-XI for the beginning of the season.</seg>
<seg id="2611">The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted three other new obligations, but he insisted that the club already had a "fantastic job" to fulfill three of his four primary new obligations.</seg>

<seg id="2615">The U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="2616">The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing started in Marquette in Michigan State and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the USA, which are several thousand kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="2617">The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The radar screens were the form of a Dreamliner.</seg>

<seg id="2672">Those who want to renovate their home in the years can soon get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">In addition, mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg Urban Development informed us on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the briefing, Schindler once again gave a look back on what happened so far.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there have been in certain areas of renovation.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Back then, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the State of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the area of refurbishment II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, recent renovations are a "success project" - it is important to promote internal development and not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, I received the information from the Presidency of Karlsruhe that there will be a renovation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount was 833 333 Euro, amounting to 500 000 euros from the country, the rest from the community.</seg>

<seg id="2685">The bridge represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Keller presented the contents of the federal government programme "Social City," where the renovations would then be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the program is the revitalization of inner cities, improving living conditions and working relationships, and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out object-related, i.e. per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The area of refurbishment would then be defined as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The funding period for funding has been running since January 1, 2017, until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">However, until September of this year, however, the stock resumption would be carried out only once, within the framework of which the participants in the rehabilitation area received a questionnaire for filling out.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the aim of the constitution is to take place as far as possible, so that the renovations can begin next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently declared that every commune had to carry out the said pre-examinations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The aim is to assess the urban abuses and decide when to rehabilitate and to what extent.</seg>

<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasised that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse is relieved by pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the opinion of author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement, "We are Church," declared by the former Regensburg bishop and present-day cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Cathedral Choir Master George Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the former Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very useful to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their false assessment of the processes at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised that in the reporting of violence in the Domspatzen, "double standards" were measured.</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, nobody doubts that it is about "shameful and shameful acts," which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" is conspicuous, "explains the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is already part of everyday life and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "people like to go to the church and that's a feeble fresco."</seg>
<seg id="2898">She also pointed out that in her youth "blows had been a very normal educational tool," to be done with bold children as I was one. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">It is unfair to apply today's standards for past decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports of abuse, Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann writes, who wrote the memorandum "My brother to the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," "" "" "" "says Hesemann," "" "" "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the solicitor Ms. Ulrich Weber from the diocese of Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen was sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, says: "in summary, it can be said that in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied by Domkapellmeister R..</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in case of high emotionality, the punishment for the students could be more severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, in contrast to many other allegations, many casualties cherished the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him in many cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Heshbon explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger explains in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against protective charms at the Regensburger Domspatzen." is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand, many students emphasise his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as a choline-clerk and a perfectionist who became palpable when a Domspatz did not bring any top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as its biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">It is precisely about eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted by any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool also occurred outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can at best reproach him, learn from it too late or have taken first indications not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The domain gymnasium on which he worked was perceived by virtually all those surveyed as "Redemption," "Heaven" and "Better World."</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus, the broad majority of his disciples, Georg Ratzinger, also exhibits an excellent testimony, describing him as "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly fed the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy, and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to screams.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only bang with chairs and cast the keys on the ground, but also distributed ear-cowards and drew too cheeky guys to the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regrets and apologises for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the frail times, the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a high school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrifying sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, these are admittedly bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not more likely to do with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media just rushed on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many people who have never understood him are still working diligently at the Bavarian Pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report is relieved by Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">The media reported a lot about abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger also be accused of involvement in sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted themselves to the Cathedral Choir Master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "" "" "said one affected representative for the others," "" "" "" "Everything was very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the education of sexual abuse has been and is, however, that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators, in a professional way, to a certain extent.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you rate the Ratzinger Ratzinger's role in the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case where he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... even to be really absurd to assume that it is just for him... to have more intrusive or clearer or more opened than in relation to their parents, internatal leaders, trustees, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... is unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "" "" "thus the report concludes with the clear result:" "" "" "" "that the students and / or their environment affected him in the run-up could not be confirmed as part of the investigation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is to be acquitted by any co-worker.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Nor can he be accused of obstructing him or having brought him to the advert.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflicting crimes, as was unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "" "" "in the media a lot of" "" "" "" "violent excesses" "" "" "" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of "looking away" in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything was mixed up and mixed up in the reporting to a huge throng of sexual abuse and excesses and somewhere, right in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely what is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, there is a clean separation: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence as well as, we once say, other reproaches.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful investigator pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were properly harassed and portrayed, and were terribly suffering, were all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have reigned.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger didn't have anything to do, because he got the boys only to see when they were already at the Domspatz gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "" "" "the theme of" "" "" "" "pre-school" "" "" "" "was on the one hand, like most of the witnesses." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">You were only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradisical" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatz gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline already, but no sadistic force.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims praised the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him in many cases."</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most, the blame remains to have digested away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he was just beginning to establish himself and from his predecessors at a school where he was not working and was responsible (so the witness) did not want to hear, and then only in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut the ears in front of the conditions?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatz gymnasium, who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "" "" "in this he points out that" "" "" "" "in the preschool, the punishment will continue to be practiced." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended penetrating engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as an investigator, had long been banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal grey zone, as each one of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where the affected people might have been exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the punishment for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the "pitfall of anachronism," i.e. the danger of evaluating past moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and not for what was faded in the preschool of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the then usual.</seg>
<seg id="2977">It's all horrible and I'm glad that it finally is working out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, that is to say ear-cowards and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then banned, he has kept strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "" "" "what picture of his time in the Regensburger times was Georg Ratzinger playing in the talks with you for the book" "" "" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of punishment come into speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the domes played only a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not at all entail that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world trang institution, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, one does not even get a big singer and before every success from unruly boys, regardless of which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "what kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger talking about her book?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I have met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deep-believing and heart-loving people, of whom you can't imagine that he could also do something to a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get into contact with him, how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his registration, visit him regularly, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today that he was once strictly speaking to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of his domes are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect to which they still look up today and which they almost worship.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, again quite clearly: all that is being presented to him are educational methods that were then on the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we can be glad we have long overcome this time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is only too obvious the evil intent that is behind it.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for the report that has just been published relieves him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the decency would stop, a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, at last in peace.</seg>
