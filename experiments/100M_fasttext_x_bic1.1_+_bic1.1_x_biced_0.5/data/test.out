28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stair@@ well of a local mall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said that he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse found in the West@@ field Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided into San Francisco &apos;s court medical department .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was clas@@ sed as murder and the investigations are underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , shared his dream job as a chef at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gali@@ cia stated that Frank was initially living in host@@ els , but that &quot; things went up for him at last . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared with Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
to associate his way with his family was to cook us something to prepare dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia .
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that bri@@ ghtly lit every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information in the event will be asked to call the T@@ oll @-@ on of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put into drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston needs to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star unmistak@@ ably clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always plu@@ gged into drawers or get stuck on the outside label that has little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire to be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be honest , these things are more likely to s@@ nu@@ ff me . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about her as &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan .
the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , a TV with a broken D@@ utt and Mexican food , is called in the magazine .
&quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; says the Hollywood star .
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is a single mother of two sons .
the film runs from 25th August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues was looking for a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted home at the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and that was the end of the riding career .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer from all time - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses .
he let himself be led with his family about the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even go for photographic purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and there@@ with also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
German sports aid handed the man out of An@@ hausen into the Golden Py@@ ramid of the Sport as part of a small gala .
there is no lack of awards for the symp@@ athetic athlete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ ne lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the Queen of Britain has already ad@@ joined him .
the 18th winner of the sports pyramid is long .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports on Saturday .
the awards include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ ver , the founder of Cor@@ nel@@ ia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the pioneer Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the hand@@ ball Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company went to the show stadium , where the Lav@@ azza prize went .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance from the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tru@@ mp economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the two US presidential candidates are not one at the tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental principle .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton are a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction .
on the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warn of how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he himself would be quite different , says Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely drive back regul@@ ators and he is responsible for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfill , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would be increased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must invest in this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tru@@ mp and Clinton almost spe@@ ech@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly refused by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
in other words , even party @-@ internal discussions could come to Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the differences in energy and climate policy are more significant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the US again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas ; it wants to announce the Paris climate protection agreement .
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand renewable energy with its investment program and demands : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ cal trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the United States from international trade , but simply to better protect American jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should be paid better then , for example , Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be up , he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion in the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics de@@ em it that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants them to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence belongs almost to everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arms .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she smil@@ ed briefly and kis@@ sed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the managing director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are P@@ oultry .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ centralized units for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs set up the establishment with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Charity .
it has recently been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as a visitor .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as a hope @-@ maker , &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in women , other reasons prevail : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many secretly steal from it because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honour kill@@ ings , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tu@@ gs for example demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
anyone who believes that the end , as soon as they come in Germany , mis@@ ses , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and , in the worst case , mis@@ used .
this means that about 90 per cent of women who live in the Shel@@ ter in Munich &apos;s North are traumati@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about what they experienced because shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , more accommodations need only for them , demands B@@ ahr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , the seven District Govern@@ ments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some with no answer to the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their sphere of responsibility .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in accommodations of the Govern@@ ments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia , escap@@ ing women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committee in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or become men and women together , it can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is in the study .
how much the women feel this need for protection can be read out at the crowd that is available at the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily open a second house .
assistance doctors argue : demands for new work combat measures
representatives of the resident doctors have called upon their union to approve new work combat measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to approve more work combat measures from the start of September .
the J@@ DC testified that ministers agreed to respond to the concerns about the contract .
in July , assistance doctors and medical students voted in favour of the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who were posted on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; would have remained a problem , which led to the refusal of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In consideration of this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and request official new negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to approve a running program of escal@@ ating work combat measures that begin in early September .
the disputes led to the fact that these resident doctors struck six times this year , the first total failure in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A resident doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings that were still held before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistance doctors and medical students that the contract should be beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , the minister of health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish counterpart in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s Palace , I can &apos;t defend myself from the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile appeared narrow@@ ly and he hardly radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report a whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if there was never anything bad .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
but a sustainable bol@@ dness issued by Putin showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had not forgotten anything .
on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border with Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was kind@@ led .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to fall back on Russia .
the off@@ ence was even bigger , as it was made by a supposed friend .
to rebuild the ve@@ to becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media launched a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
the most serious accus@@ ations of senior officials were that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from President Erdo@@ gan .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after finishing last month in a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at of almost his office .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this week the government projected cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti put it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West as it looks at its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment on the s@@ nail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ankara , the Russian head of state secured a bonus for the fact that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat , he demanded support for the elected state organs .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this glorious palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; as an analy@@ st once described to me : two countries that viol@@ ate themselves from the West and are badly treated and now al@@ lied .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played a role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents met at the press conference that they hadn &apos;t even touched the subject .
the president of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey ab@@ duc@@ ted the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state would at least talk to each other again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
according to the board of directors of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand is only to be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the global ambi@@ tions of the Bank .
since then , the bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
in this period , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; R@@ BS &quot; to protect other end @-@ consumer brands .
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by up to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus more on national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , de@@ centralised headquarters and stock exchange listing to Nat@@ west are changed .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private client business that will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
during a sightseeing tour by customers and employees , Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our staff will be busy , as we are now more to become a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with our customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to become a bank of brands , as how do we focus internally ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the CEO .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and had launched these trademarks .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3,@@ 000@@ th profit at New@@ market on a dile@@ mma
D@@ ett@@ ori spark@@ s champagne after a double in New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th prize
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he placed a milestone on his local circuit with his second prize of the night at Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he succ@@ eeds Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won in front of G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is also here
I &apos;m very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I &apos;ve landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ er when he brings victory to dile@@ mma
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 wins in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career star@@ ters
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only a few have achieved before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect , which differenti@@ ates him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma have been enthusiastic fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already obtained 6.000 € winn@@ ings if he were not just a weekend and big tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey !
in the UK , Frank@@ ie has already suffered nearly 30 years of the winners , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben in 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a ban on drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive character to def@@ y his two @-@ fl@@ yers and to return to his best form .
and he hasn &apos;t come to the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.00 years of age .
Russian Putin hum@@ idi@@ ots Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expectedly released his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the narrow@@ est confidence circle of Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for Environmental and Transport Opport@@ unities .
in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it is said that without stating reasons , Putin has ordered &quot; the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been a substitute for Ivan@@ ovo since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it is said ( in Russian ) that he later became a cler@@ k and deputy head of the governing body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your work as a Head of State on the implementation of your instructions and controls .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o recommended his successor .
do smiling faces convince ?
Moscow has mysteri@@ ously made this step .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ dant and works as he was for the Soviet Secret Service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff with@@ drew on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is this the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president , would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin being quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , I could almost say , to trust ad@@ orable items for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
he was previously Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted the most .
it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , since a third term of office would have viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close ally Putin &apos;s ally , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister before being re @-@ elected three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination of the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced their termination in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al .
on the set there were artistic differences and differences of opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ son from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was there since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my entire lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od over the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the planned broadcasting of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a population of Ban@@ ff requested help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 f@@ ishings might be sand @-@ whales , which were sp@@ iced out by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ on Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ on cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hel@@ ical ropes .
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
the Minister of Economic Affairs , Keith Brown , visited the building site today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ on cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all the witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
overall , almost 79 % of the total deck decks are at their place and the last section of the deck today gets a pleasure for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project manager at For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tor , said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone for each bridge project .
this fantastic project presents the closure of trend@@ setting high and low construction .
after installing the last section of the road and its connection with the North tower , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the north side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , about 6,000 tons weighs and has to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
delicate as the toler@@ ances that the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately , everything went very well .
saving in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off their fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck an alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat ran around and set us worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y hanging without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , however , the boat was released by the person who was steering the boat .
someone watches over these men today .
seriously injured - man stab@@ bed his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
as the police informed yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had received the key to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
instead , the alcohol @-@ charged off@@ ender cuts his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothes .
when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured at his hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothes , he called his mother .
this then aler@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down her brother .
but she could not persu@@ ade him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her companions .
on the street , they met the ex @-@ life @-@ partner of the man .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who is building Braunschwei@@ gs cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 affordable apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next council session . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the argument is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
so far , there is a regulation missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann believes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who want to build on urban areas must in future reject 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces , but as far as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development program , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , will provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er conditions for investors .
no matter what , so Brat@@ wur@@ st , a worsen@@ ing of the situation in the housing market .
if the action plan is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the professionals .
but the programme is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how does one compensate for the loss of further around 1300 affordable apartments , whose promotion will run out in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prevent this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ms Nicole Palm , planning policy spokes@@ woman should now be purchased from the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it would have to be thought to get apartments back in the price binding .
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
the problem could be solved at one stroke .
at the end of the year , Fri@@ sten are working in West@@ stadt .
around 1800 apartments could be found there back in the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this is not what the owners , the housing associations , do not want .
because the number of social housing in the west town is increased dramatically again , one removes itself from the goal of so @-@ called mixing .
there should be no concentration of socially weak in just a few quarters of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens expect it to be still in the debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must go into the boat for a large majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although they have concentrated on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can still be found ?
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth
it is fascinating to watch the world changing .
that teenagers and kids don &apos;t go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens has been lam@@ ented by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ em@@ on Go is about bringing people away from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last but not least on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the publication of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand declined in early July .
the market launch in other countries was shifted due to the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and nearly as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ mon which can be tra@@ cked with a GPS once they have been found &quot; photographed &quot; ( using a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the boat and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person puts back every day .
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35@@ ,000 users , informed the Washington Post recently that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of follow @-@ up people who exercise 30 minutes each day , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
many public awareness campaigns that people want to take &quot; themselves 30 minutes &quot; time to &quot; get out of the sofa &quot; and &quot; to be active every day &quot; stum@@ bled on deaf ears because many public messages to health are dull and come from people who look miserable .
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ valued .
those who exercise regularly can reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here .
but the wonder@@ full thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun .
three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even make new friend@@ ships during the hunt .
as always there are also gru@@ mp@@ y game @-@ destro@@ yers , who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should it be ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could trace our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its attraction and the use will fade with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world and will help many people to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the ladies &apos; court
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is on all that im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
stun@@ n@@ ingly on the ground .
brilliant on a whole line .
and now finally Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast sounded the championship title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winners and &quot; Final Five &quot; team com@@ rad@@ or A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es ur@@ ges on the Swedish bar during the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ combat title and the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her call to be the best of her generation , or even at all .
she burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
this success puts her in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought her sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated her sport for the past three years - including 10 gold med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u rescue on her said she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected a final examination in Brazil , a competition that did not go so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered a disappointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ campaign of women at the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clam@@ ation mark at the farewell party of retired co @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on having never planned the future during their long journey , this is not really true .
part of her floor exercises - which contain her typical tum@@ bling pass - is att@@ un@@ ed to Latin American music that would fit in at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
it is not by chance .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost a competition competition , a series of victories that will stop as long as Bil@@ es wishes .
even though Mu@@ staf@@ ina easily led through two turns , the picture was clou@@ dy .
Swedish bars and floor stars - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ ned .
she resum@@ ed again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and sat on top with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her sof@@ tly as her ende@@ a@@ vors were expecting - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed at Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ a in Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team cap , called &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after her ground exercise she threw the audience kis@@ ses , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly expanding twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in a series mur@@ der@@ ous shot when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl , who died in one of the dead@@ liest cancers since a decade , were killed in the car and listened to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ held fire@@ arm while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police announced that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the aggres@@ sor did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 taking possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic homes within four months and two more were injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS at the beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and that the same mur@@ derer was committed .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the thre@@ ef@@ old murder and assumed that it was the work of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his contem@@ por@@ aries , Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder about whom his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing about her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I didn &apos;t manage it .
I don &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let go of that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course you have embark@@ ed on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband , Vincent and her , have been told that Ed@@ mund will never know them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of age and he can still not speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing something before &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News commented .
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund invented some signs on her own .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infection with viruses such as meas@@ les or the ci@@ ca@@ virus during pregnancy .
symptoms and pre@@ dictions may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of infected with the Zi@@ ka@@ virus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ ka@@ virus .
it will be better .
you know it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding causes ba@@ il@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on Friday to call out the emergency .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floods after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards informed that state officials in constant contact with local authorities are already on the road to help the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness , announced that requests for flood @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested 10 thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that there could be an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area .
in southern Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday while it was ra@@ ining in the Mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses into the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that an current downward floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish poses a danger , as these rivers are slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as via the beaten rivers .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded at 09.@@ 00 on Friday .
rescue teams still plu@@ cked people out of flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed from Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , has a strong rise over night .
he said that another boot @-@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water stre@@ amed and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had any disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding &quot; spread rapidly , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities were considering ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions .
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer near Liv@@ ing@@ stone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13,@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that due to the rainf@@ alls , the soil has been substantially absorbed since Wednesday .
the authorities said that heavy rain and road floo@@ ding caused the rescu@@ ing of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and L@@ ess@@ ard L@@ oss in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary in WW@@ L reported that a subsidiary in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches that were now both flooded .
the leader of the municipality Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals r@@ ins@@ ed by floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were arranged to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed because of the high water and sand@@ bags were provided for residents that hope to keep the water from their homes and businesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last great flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to be flooded , but on Friday no reports were reported .
Keith T@@ own@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places where I &apos;ve never seen it before , &quot; T@@ own@@ son said , &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by spheres , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police announces that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents showed that Brown suffered several gun@@ shot injuries including the loin , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in the hospital during his transportation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was bul@@ ged with bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distributed his grandmother Del@@ ore Mel@@ chis@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was shot at the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who finds himself in a critical condition , reported the station .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently it had come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge shells for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were re@@ trac@@ ted to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ took the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly a continuing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were the sleeves .
thus it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; said Police Department Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di the police in Philadelphia to the station .
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a shi@@ pper on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she re@@ covers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I present to me under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ns and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and secondly , this team has three tur@@ ners , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jewish girl and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is the Catho@@ lics , makes everybody proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female gym@@ na@@ sts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a start@@ ling Olympic winner and America was che@@ ering .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ ms routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual event for multiple events .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see turn classes throughout the country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same path as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to join the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . also , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but the reality is that Tur@@ ns are an expensive sport and gym@@ na@@ sts in the first place in private gymnas@@ tics , which are maintained by parents who are responsible for training , training , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ tables are in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the gym@@ na@@ sts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes since they started with the gymnas@@ tics .
we have to provide a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access gym training to the communities with countless , young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie .
I founded my gym@@ nasi@@ um of 20 years .
at my events we have offered free and affordable gymnas@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls interested in the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gold and thank you for motiv@@ ating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
resident doctors want to organise more strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance doctors who voted for election rejected him .
in July , Hun@@ t had revealed plans to introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; and would be detri@@ mental to staff and patients .
the first resident doctors are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and week endar@@ s , in order to improve the care of the watch @-@ times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chair of the BM@@ A Committee on Regi@@ sters , announced last night in a communication with : &quot; we are still seriously concerned about the proposed agreement , in particular that it will heat up the current mat@@ ernity crisis and ad@@ ministers it to treat all the doctors . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new treaty , progress has to be made and time runs out .
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes caused by discussions have been tac@@ kled by the government for reluct@@ ance to participate and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this happened to a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had just done last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise the vibrations and address the concerns of the resident doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he fails to do so , the resident doctors have made it clear that they are ready to conduct further work combat measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a resp@@ ite of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to physicians on the strike chain .
the ministers hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the Re@@ formed Con@@ tract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better week@@ day pay for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employees , requested the assistance doctors to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past two months , we have spoken to the committee of assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns of guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as des@@ patch , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training camps and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health were concerned with respect to the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ a day medicine that can reduce heart attacks
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ a day medication after advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the co@@ agulation drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or a further heart attack .
the N@@ ICE Regul@@ atory Authority has recommended a four @-@ year long @-@ term intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE Regul@@ atory Authority has recommended a four @-@ year long @-@ term intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that make plaque .
when the layer breaks apart , it can cause blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged up blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the draft of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all individuals who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person &apos;s quality of life .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture Ad@@ dresses electoral fraud in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year for the dis@@ miss@@ al of a government report because of corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread ignor@@ ing widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities , such as a devastating government report today .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and city coun@@ cill@@ ors for ignor@@ ing evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity in eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , who is now an ant@@ in@@ itarian king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters on religious grounds would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barri@@ ques outside of electoral cub@@ icles in order to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should show an identification card in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present a vot@@ er only needs to name his name and address .
the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink to a person &apos;s finger if they give up their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he claims that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s electoral campaign in eastern London .
last year , a special electoral tribunal decided that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would silence his critics with racism and extremis@@ m accus@@ ations .
Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which one person chooses somebody else .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country .
he expressed himself in particular al@@ arming for the dec@@ ep@@ tive letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the leadership of ID cards to prove their identity .
in his report , it says : &quot; as proof that pressure was applied to vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... State institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour because of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists process letters of letters in order to stop poll@@ ing .
the report envis@@ aged by Ther@@ esa May also calls for tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as it has given up its voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
to carry out systematic reviews of the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic let@@ tering .
prohibition that political activists process complete let@@ ins and envel@@ opes from mail@@ boxes .
the police have the authority to set up lock@@ outs for electoral stations .
a change of legislation facilit@@ ating an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 .
prohibition of photography in electoral stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the poll@@ ing stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees generally enforce that voters walk alone in the election cabin .
Sir Eric drops across the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s case there was no complaint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral tribunal has declared Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the constitu@@ encies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country , as the Mother of the Par@@ liam@@ ents , bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation .

the team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks incredibly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ins@@ anity in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy announced the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I probably take it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the start@@ ling simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes is said to be a double @-@ runner for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one way higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athletic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
another lasting comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ mut , who has similar ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal winner Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va has more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans , an &quot; athletic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others liked the simil@@ arities also
theory into the room : according to this user there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar facial form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold med@@ alli@@ sts in the tower Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

Canadian television station C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers called &quot; how low &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig dying . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he put his own opinions off at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free stil@@ ish squ@@ ad@@ ron .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought to the commentary team of the C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; colour , &quot; one could say : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , as low as M@@ ief , died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the floating relay 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and the language .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not get that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as moment@@ arily in the final 4 x 200m free clas@@ sy staff@@ el for women : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter happened quickly and hard , in which many people talked to him .
Twitter users did not keep back when they heard of how in@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald was
another Twitter user wrote in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
shortly after , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC program , ap@@ ologi@@ zed live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end more than 90 times with the people who responded to the Noti@@ ce on Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze on behalf of Mac@@ don@@ ald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies with more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining of Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave out a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our spectators on the show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Swimming staff@@ el in the C@@ BC Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the midst of business
the buyers did not know where to go when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try under@@ pants .
in order to ag@@ grav@@ ate the situation , she scrut@@ ini@@ zed how she looked at it , pulled it out and put it back into the shelf .
she continued to browse and tasted four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone in which the woman pro@@ bed the pants before she put it back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she moved back and leaving the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own stock@@ ings and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as they put them back on the shelves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other h@@ osen before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , took off again and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to bother anyone watching or thinking about the person who might buy the pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how disgu@@ sting is that someone would take their pants home who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to pull out clothes from sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and went out and not been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming into question were pulled out of sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or the back , this video will show you how to turn the sp@@ ears for your rob@@ ber .
when approaching from behind you should turn around first so that you can see your aggres@@ sor and &quot; go out of the shot , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
then grab the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
beat it then with the knee in the bar and twist while the attack@@ er cur@@ es from pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat it with the barrel and move backwards while holding the weapon on it .
for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist them so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot .
at the same time shift the weight to the weapon and beat the aggres@@ sor to the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before they move backwards and set the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi advances .
but remember that if you &apos;re not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master , the saf@@ est thing to do is to deliver your money .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right swe@@ eps his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe for a travel guide
a British trav@@ eller enter@@ tained his immune system and the worms of a serious test by le@@ aking up some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k pushed his course on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a draw toilet as well as a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before le@@ aning every object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved .
but the experiment that was in@@ filtr@@ ated under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Stren@@ g@@ th &quot; brought some surprising results to light .
the thought to lick the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a draw toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things .
from public stations to railway stations to jet@@ ting dum@@ pling of toilets , the task posed its immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and slu@@ dge . &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial balance showed a lumin@@ ometric figure of more than 4000 units .
in comparison , the lumin@@ ometric number of fresh washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick after their lumin@@ ometric rating amounted to over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Stren@@ g@@ th , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I have done in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I won &apos;t lick anything here because it is disgu@@ sting inside here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Stren@@ g@@ th &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
vali@@ o Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New Rel@@ eases Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer something new .
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had to lick him like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick it and others where it was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria particularly with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they use at least occasional products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ cial family destroyed before del@@ ousing social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social apartment after del@@ o@@ cul@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 because they had terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ by and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls showed g@@ aping holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn up , rub@@ b@@ ish was spread on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared onto the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the property management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment could no longer be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I believe people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is likewise .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime , and the police said that the terror which the family had caused , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking , and excessive scre@@ ams , disputes and cur@@ ses included .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior in June .
old tr@@ ash has been found in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances .
in the estate , where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were torn up
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing led her and her partner viol@@ ently from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily move out .
the del@@ o@@ cul@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors , who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t care about anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Managers of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have agreed to co @-@ operate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long
on the over@@ grown side of the community house , garbage and old toys were thrown down .
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family , as del@@ o@@ cul@@ ation is always the last step into consideration of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously approached us and provided us with information .
I hope that this development will give some comfort to some neighbours and the message convey@@ ed that anti@@ social behaviour will not be tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ sting on the floor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; workers in house management will now have to clean garbage mountains surrounding the house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ ,000 cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ by received a fine after having found himself guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in commercial for@@ esi@@ ght .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were homeless , T@@ anya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will navigate rent@@ ers who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told us that del@@ o@@ cul@@ ation is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal stag@@ gered after an eff@@ or@@ tless military jet over@@ rides a beach
sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of the air fighting forces made an incredible flight
the Air Force showed that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no safety risk
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a ti@@ cking jet crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost close to the sun worshi@@ ppers at the beach in Av@@ eiro in northern Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers j@@ umped up when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what was coming on them through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos on the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deeply twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would drop me down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were terri@@ fied when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low .
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and to fly so low that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to the bad visibility of the area , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety at no time was at risk .
land fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland during this summer , in which four people on the island of Madeira have died .
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot had to fly as low as possible due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke - which limits its vision
the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worry against Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in Du@@ eling around the Spanish Super@@ cup in@@ ward against FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash goes up three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ W@@ inner must abst@@ ain from N@@ ey@@ mar , who cont@@ ests the Olympic football tournament in Brazil , with the sub@@ le@@ ased cup@@ fin@@ alist and reign@@ ing European league champion among others .
in addition , there is also a lack of Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , which clari@@ fied the opening question at Bar@@ ca at least for the time being in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
for two years , the Chil@@ ean Internationale and T@@ er St@@ egen comp@@ eted in Barcelona for the status as number one .
coach Luis En@@ rique gave up a clear decision so far and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but in the majority of the other cont@@ ests he left the entrance .
before the first compulsory game of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness state of the crew , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool at 0 : 4 .
at 3 : 2 in the rehear@@ sal op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. have not really been able to convince .
Sevilla , on the other hand , has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat after extending the European Super@@ cup to Real Madrid , striving for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with up to now , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition .

the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; tit@@ le@@ holder &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one @-@ sided finale .
thus , the World Ranking List picked the Golden Grand S@@ lam winning the World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and the Olympic Games .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese did it as expected in the Final Game and made the title with each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would catch the sing@@ les title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top of the Olympia podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and with time @-@ outs they didn &apos;t have coaches with them .
they had pulled back to the grand@@ stand and left their cont@@ actors on their own in fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have played the matches to here for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang said in logical terms .
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expectedly one @-@ sided .
Ma really had to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
after that he set the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang down there only a total of 13 points .
the su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
nevertheless , there were enough breath @-@ taking pictures of the ball to be seen .
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the bronze play against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the White @-@ Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had drawn a ri@@ b injury in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . after that , he had to settle with sheet metal in the end .
by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) have become a similarly high table tennis player Olympia @-@ fourth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tru@@ mp protects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge problems &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in the traditional conservative states , to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp now announced weaknesses of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can strongh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confi@@ dently occurring mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary expressed such concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
after he threw 16 ri@@ vals in his own republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success in the White House are growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have massive problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp in front of Evangel@@ ical Christians who asked him for support in major states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wrong@@ ly reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media group .
tor@@ ches of republi@@ can strongh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ USA out of June , Tru@@ mp and his rival were equal to the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not with the distance that is common for republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview with the CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp answered the question how he wanted to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very beautiful , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it did not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , this was fine , Tru@@ mp said .
then I returned to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party should have threatened the Tru@@ mp to cut funds in support of its electoral campaign , it should not be able to present any better survey values .
instead of that , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans want to attack the Congress more strongly .
Olympics : three sc@@ ams on dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the threat of the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee announced immediately to set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan official announced that the former S@@ printer and current coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village gave a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya from the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF world association has requested the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to test their own investigations , sharing an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IO@@ C the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , sample and signed , &quot; explained Kenya chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who was on the list for the training controls of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in 2015 in Beijing W@@ WM @-@ fourth over 800 meters .
four days earlier , Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation Michael Rot@@ ich was dra@@ fted by the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed sports@@ men of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested on his return to Nairobi airport .
in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing off@@ enses , Kenya has been under special surveillance for quite some time .
during the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer Games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic Games commen@@ ced .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya took part in the list of countries whose D@@ oping control was compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a large runner @-@ nation .
athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports of the ARD , alle@@ gations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und requested a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
it has been proven that this kind of sport has been comprehen@@ sively examined and systematically mut@@ ated .
as a result , Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Shakespeare &apos;s year the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and met with the role of Maria a youth room .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the leadership of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say that it is very Latin American . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly at her love with Tony while the younger Maria is playing and dancing .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Maria &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
it is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to my Italian character that I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli goes back to the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , which is very important at all !
for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ pp@@ ies went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them .
they are the same topics , and today they are just as meaningful as they were then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school girl , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria
Kad@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British ma@@ ids who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ no@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago .
it was thought that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had planned to leave the war@@ med land and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks involved in going into a war zone - stopping people from ever making this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other girls from the east of London boar@@ ded a plane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will stay for the Supreme Court in the case of an election victory at Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate Justice Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked the confirmation of Gar@@ lands since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor to the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said he had not talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulates .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the US Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the nom@@ ination of Gar@@ lands , be lack@@ eys and auxili@@ aries of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp .
he also noted that Donald Tru@@ mp is un@@ fit for the presidential office .
Tre@@ ats wants nu@@ ch@@ al calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine collabor@@ ates with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mers to bring a 1970 @-@ year Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked human beings , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ at Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine distinguishes old school play@@ boys , because Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently it is the view that the Calendar does also .
&quot; we must return to the portra@@ yal of timeless and classical n@@ ak@@ edness in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release on the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass flight
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Stiftung Dialog and Welt , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kurdish community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of people who fled from Turkey to Germany in the short term .
in the medium term , it could even be &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
following a coup attempt by Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand protection @-@ seekers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already out@@ stri@@ pped cur@@ d strongh@@ olds several months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey were on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the dec@@ ei@@ ving put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that absor@@ bs refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the group of associations accused the targeted res@@ ett@@ lement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
thus Erdo@@ gan &apos;s intention is to increase the pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or driven over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission chief urged that the Federal Government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positioned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; takes place against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks into foreign countries .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , above all Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the Brand@@ mark@@ ung as Gü@@ len @-@ Pend@@ ant destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mi@@ cians the professional existence .
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and secular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Stiftung Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the newspaper calling on the figures of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks had already set up the largest group of asylum entitled asylum entitled to asylum in Germany before the coup .
on the reporting date June 30 , this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and there@@ with almost 29 percent of all applicants as eligible for asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , they do not find themselves worthy of war , poverty or lack of prospects .
asylum entitled under the Basic Law are exclusively political , that is , from the state side , individual pursu@@ its .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where it hur@@ ts , &quot;
wei@@ rd Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not choose the Land@@ tag .
they understood them in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
in 2021 , the Sunday election will not take place right at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
for so far it is not stupid : summer holidays , heat and land election campaigns - that bites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the poll@@ s , are on holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers travelling in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so you can &apos;t choose the holiday .
there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count voices at the end , only work hard .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and the last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has once again forced to pass electoral campaign close to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , has to fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
exciting is how strongly new@@ bie Af@@ D cuts off and what remains in the end co@@ ali@@ tion@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost invisible electoral campaign , one sees from his big posters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and talks a little with the people , just as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did .
otherwise , sea ering has got cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel to blame for the revival of the Af@@ D .
her refugee policy , her &quot; We create it , &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the fine office .
the CD@@ U , with its leading candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when one makes election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time .
she has twice invited chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to major events ; Merkel Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ sw@@ ahl@@ kreis is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently accused N@@ DR .
but it &apos;s a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise the north @-@ east CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual election conditions at market places and from shopping centres with solar shiel@@ ds and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that , according to Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Union has also noted that in the country you have to remove the base that it has to work very hard to find a wire to the people again .
you are going to do it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any present in the expan@@ ses of the country .
the advice of the CD@@ U election comb@@ at@@ ants Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ est , Golden Wed@@ dings , any birthday party has to be used . &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD a particularly committed election campaign .
in surveys last week , the S &amp; D Group la@@ gged behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election 2011 , the SPD had clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the surveys , are likely to make the leap into the country day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ need and spend most of their election campaigns on the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from that , green electoral fighters embar@@ k on a search for local vocal folds among the holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ vy straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg Lake and finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
for those responsible for the construction , which start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at 20 o &apos;clock , there are all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done everything pretty sha@@ ky , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no delay .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything will be ready .
this is also v@@ owed by the ab@@ sent@@ ee of those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of lodging drives .
since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and that the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is again , the traffic situation within the village has eased .
the citizens can now move from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen to the B 27 on both sides .
the passing traffic by the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were sometimes significant complaints , &quot; says Florian King , head of office for the refurb@@ ishment management of the refurb@@ ishment .
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ ators were looking for and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sig@@ nage .
what led to the fact that many trucks in residential areas were fran@@ ch@@ ising .
since the speed limits were not observed , the municipality also called for the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who himself made himself aware of the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been inj@@ ected .
the fastest was at 77 km per hour in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has moved forward , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that the road is open again for customers from Rot@@ tenburg .
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to net sales , everyone can look through .
however , some are more and some are less affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are produced for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily traffi@@ cked supermarkets are along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crowned , finds distinct words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we have to be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ties the revenue losses to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; road renovation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has dropped its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of his staff he has to release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President @-@ President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where something more gener@@ ously handled .
with all the complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
finally , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history .
he can understand that other regular guests are now less frequently overlooked because of the complicated traffic guidance .
if you can &apos;t drive , it &apos;s also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts about the fact that his pedi@@ gree is back after the end of the renovation work .
despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
it is constantly being bol@@ ted to laws on behalf of the fight against terrorism .
following the latest attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now presenting a thick security package .
but what has a terror status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all of that ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the ser@@ vers@@ al .
all his proposals are &quot; politically reasonable &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior during the presentation of his new security package .
they do not demand anybody .
others , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in it .
but as Minister of the Interior , he was on the results and at a &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has left a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some is already known , proc@@ la@@ iming that a new security agency is to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU directives on passenger data and weapons law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère launches a second attempt for proposals that have not yet been done with the SPD : he wants to serve terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conce@@ als the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers this to be reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything at the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner anyway .
a few new ideas present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère as well .
some of them have it in themselves : he plans fast procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation .
refugees who are specifically picked up in the country should be able to check their smartphones and reveal social media accounts for a safety check .
for asylum seekers who have been rejected for asylum , he wants to prove even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or sub@@ due their papers to obsc@@ ure their identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of them are politically and legally un@@ le@@ ashed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some things have an irregular effect and leaves un@@ answered questions .
and with some points - in the im@@ patient treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does it actually have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to differentiate between the topics refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it cannot be said that the residents of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
moreover , in view of the high number of refugees , many people worried about security .
and things that people pro@@ found@@ ly employed didn &apos;t let themselves be cl@@ inging to election time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inner security is enormously affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are election campaigns .
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the subject of internal security .
over the past few days , the two parties have gone up high .
only a gar@@ ris@@ ky dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the chief managers also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from a return from the double @-@ pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have satisfied the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to re@@ make it is not sensible .
and in case of a bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether its own package is constitutional at all angles and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner , must first show itself .
there is a lot of things to do for stri@@ fe .
but even the SPD is currently trying to distinguish itself from the subject of internal security .
party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel then cau@@ ti@@ ously signals the willingness to talk and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot;
Volkswagen is still able to get off lightly .
in spite of diesel failures , the extra@@ dition numbers are increasing worldwide .
but it does not work in all markets .
in the recall action , vor@@ ti@@ ces are about a term .
Volkswagen starts to sub@@ du@@ ly start deliveries in the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ functioning markets , Europe &apos;s largest autom@@ aker can further advance a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ functioning markets .
however , in July , VW &apos;s core brand slow@@ ed above all in Western Europe and again bur@@ dened overall sales , as the company quoted in Da@@ x .
in July , the VW brand sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars to 1.8 percent less than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in the home market Germany , deliveries declined by almost a sixth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; market leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann reduced the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there has been a purchase restra@@ int in some core markets due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for ex@@ iting the EU has also bur@@ dened me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the USA , where the flu@@ e gas was initially escal@@ ating , there is also a decline of a minus .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Saxony has anyway got off lightly by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only a delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler continued to show a sales growth from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated exhaust tests with a software .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million cars to retro@@ fit the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after the conversion of the vehicles , there is no degradation in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor output .
after retro@@ fitting , the car manufacturer wanted a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as was stated on Friday in company circles .
legal intri@@ c@@ acies are the reason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now granted its German customers a guarantee for ru@@ mor@@ ed diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Monday , this would have confirmed VW &apos;s representatives in the German Transport Ministry .
from the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has completely fulfilled the requirements of my Commission and the KBA Commission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from these are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power after retro@@ fitting , VW has assumed that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power after retro@@ fitting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was meant in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen can see the possibility that customers , for example , come into a workshop for example half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
in the interests of the customer , it is important to avoid that any other damage , which has nothing to do with the ass@@ uring sc@@ andal , may result in uncertainty with regard to possible warranty claims , as it was said .
therefore , I do not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see calls for wealthy depos@@ itors to pursue criminal charges in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; managing director Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on checking or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and does not see it as a signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordinary savers need not fear to pay for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stock banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0.@@ 4 percent penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fee is payable by Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits exceeding € 100,000 in sight deposit or day money accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100.000 Euros are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost € 400 a year in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been protecting 40 million euros for some time , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Head of the Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t put up for every million 4000 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the cost is now further reduced .
leaving the cash in the T@@ res@@ ors of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be far too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Austrian Co@@ operative Association declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to bear you alone is not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfer fees .
the Thur@@ in@@ gian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay deposits on deposits , so the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele who is a bit more luxuri@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they guard money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
established in 1911 , the G@@ mund Co@@ operative Bank has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs are living in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently no other banks known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , announced at the end of June : &quot; the threshold of going into the negative is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany will not be able to enjoy this in their width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
middle @-@ aged men love plates .
this statement is derived from current data before comm@@ enting on the pseu@@ don@@ ym of non @-@ Alle@@ pu@@ rea men in the middle of men with harsh insul@@ ts .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much @-@ discussed recovery of sound plates is not attributable to a boom in millenni@@ als , which want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life @-@ No@@ stal@@ gie .
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely buyer group .
there is also no hor@@ de by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance : older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do you agree with the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest gray suit and stu@@ ffed wild@@ ly before I stand , hold my hands and say something ins@@ inu@@ ating like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent vendors were located - still a handful of fantastic record specialty stores .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to turn the camera off for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to appreciate their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I follow from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged women ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of people : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4000 records .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought I was probably too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray also believes that many customers he meets to apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media group , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to re @-@ buy their old records .
from the conversations that I have conducted , people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional significance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to the WE@@ T , some of the older customers took off the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to reti@@ re to the stability of trusted Record envel@@ opes , from objects that recall happy youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is so with me as a collector so and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way of being mentally engaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month did not yet belong to them .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t have record players .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried while browsing through a stack of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came here recently and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own record players , but I &apos;d like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead record , so I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ intensive , less music class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have record players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who come in slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the sound panels to almost an entire floor , has a colorful audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts newest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze and sex@@ stra@@ ined pop rather than experimental jazz we@@ ars out of the speakers - is it good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks odd , but na@@ ï@@ ve psychological trauma is hard to imagine if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of the plates available for sale .
it is more of a window @-@ shopping than a big shopping .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting plates is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives away with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
as I give the impression of wearing jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter decide to buy a crossover .
on the left is a stair@@ well , a wall full of records by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the sector and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as records .

French court re@@ jects offer of demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle , where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities argued in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses in which people within the camp sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid , which would have a risk of fire and san@@ ity .
humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also thought that the temporary businesses and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people running the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely track@@ able . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feed people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the places that was under threat from the down@@ fall was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café of the camp , which is usually operated and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of survivors in the Dsch@@ ung@@ ell@@ ager had risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep rise in new arri@@ vals in the course of the summer .

here is the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed meas@@ urer : new flash devices are being tested in various German states , including Hessen and Brandenburg , which are especially effective to over@@ ride tem@@ pl@@ ings .
the futur@@ istic @-@ acting En@@ forcement Tra@@ ilers of the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , in areas of accident , where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example , at highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itating bridges with temporary tem@@ pl@@ ating , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary bl@@ ender for compliance with speed limits .
but a more durable mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days with un@@ interrupted activity , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be collected across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed limits as well as access restrictions based on time , road and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the high @-@ run condition , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer .
so that it is not easy to cl@@ utter , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also van@@ ish shell @-@ proof outer cover disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to specifications from Vit@@ ronic in various German states and has now also been used .
foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently , France has re @-@ ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 units last year .
UK re@@ covers silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji gets Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the de@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio .
Fi@@ ji has distributed a master class in handling , side st@@ eppe , back , lines and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was lost by the not too bad price of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the strikes , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of that , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brit@@ on will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , under R@@ yan they lost every game in the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they just lost one .
this flap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started beautifully and had the attacks on G@@ Bs from fun to boun@@ ce off .
it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. on as if one would run into running bus@@ ses . the World Series winners were rated 5 @-@ 0 to O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner .
after four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner that he turned .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a superb stap@@ le of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , in the seventh minute , Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua turned a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new member since the second half and there was still more than a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ breath@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ sured by further weak tactics of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while still learning GB .
this is how it is .
GB led fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and completed the Fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua tou@@ red Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt on GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game itself went for a long time in favor of the South Sea sul@@ try , whose fans sang , flags wave and danced on the stands .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the finishing touch with another try in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB til@@ ted cr@@ ushing in the grass .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed SA into a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer for a ru@@ dder victory
there will be no more nau@@ tical gold than with these games and that will mean something .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard dogs that enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was omni@@ present when she ruined the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old without a tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sport , who placed such a benchmark .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9th un@@ fulfilled commitment , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the Tri@@ umph@@ al Ar@@ ch .
behind each gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers that make up the difference and it was no one more instrumental than the trainer who did not know about 30 months before he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ked .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty terrible situation .
it changes a little bit to the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , off the season , which kept the break up to a minimum , if under such circumstances the right concept is at all .
I needed money , so I had to get better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
that is how it begins .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it one even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ ro@@ cking morning doing something more than anything else and trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . this is perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I do , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
it was three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something great .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , what we did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary for clarity for 31 years
the managing director of the water @-@ purpose association &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association counts as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water association as a model for the big water producers .
this meant that some time ago in the original , it was part of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk &apos;s contribution .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia s@@ wore to the purpose association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is regarded as exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who worked for 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband employee , 28 of them as Managing Director .
he was retired at the age of 65 .
the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein @-@ based V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein association , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , annually promotes approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the municipalities of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach are members of the congregations .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ ner mayor of Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from the water line construction and maintenance work through office and organisational skills , budget@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency assignments at weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding event , it called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the renovation of the high tanks ( 1999 ) , the purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the modernization of water pipes .
there have been no down@@ times and you have always added innovations because water is the most important food for life and drinking water .
in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he worked with a lot of lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od for his water @-@ purpose association and he lived down@@ right the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for lowering nit@@ rate in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received very much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ eller , for his part , praised water go@@ al@@ keeper Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water man and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view he described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the purpose association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were the tu@@ b@@ ular break@@ age at the high reservoir at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on January 3 .
here we had to work all night at minus 17 degrees , so that the towns could be supplied with water .
one once could only maintain the supply of new brunn , because one filled the elevated cr@@ ater of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n County ) on Friday and injured her fat@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself and told us to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , and after him will be prosec@@ uted .
now nationwide because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1.80 meters large , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald .
meanwhile the police published a photo of him .
it is , however , a few years old .
meanwhile , the man we@@ ars a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the gun with him , so the police .
those who see Sven S. shall call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police speaks of a &quot; relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
at first , the competent police in Lü@@ beck wanted to make no mention of the departure or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; however , she confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - a view of the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ shaken and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in the millions .
financial burdens that the sector threatened with green power support are from the table .
it remains with the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Sour@@ ces at the existing plants for so @-@ called own electricity production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only once the generators are replaced in the steel mills , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent falls .
but this , too , is not elevated in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on electricity generation .
in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the successful endeav@@ our of Gabriel for the steel industry is particularly important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of our campaign &quot; steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emissions trading , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation continued to ag@@ grav@@ ate when the world &apos;s largest producer of products made massive steel on the world market in the face of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers are throwing prices dump@@ ing Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring the situation somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , import duties imposed on import steel show impact , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have bri@@ gh@@ tened .
it is unclear how sustain@@ ably the price recovery is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp now also did not want to exclude the closures of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and growing orders .
they produced by 3.4 million tons of less crude steel than in the previous year , as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the amount produced was going back to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has fallen by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
thanks to an improved order situation , the association expects an increase in output in the coming months .
community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she took the subject of music in the school choir , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing inspir@@ es me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more lively , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors just from several perspectives , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says from the German Senior Championships .
most sen@@ iors sing in chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describing H@@ ac@@ kl@@ ers .
regular cooperation allows sen@@ iors to soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures are dis@@ solving in old age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
singing can be ti@@ ring in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sen@@ iors are training deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand their lungs get out of the pu@@ ff , even in everyday life .
even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at age , singing is an ideal hobby .
on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz , of the Federal Labour Association of senior citizens .
in the older generations , singing together had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , it explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people aw@@ akes many memories , often connected with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , self @-@ dementia suffer@@ ers dev@@ ise long @-@ lying events .
in singing , a special power is required for the head , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time focusing on one &apos;s voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone are doing so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir too .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens .
there are good reasons to start singing , so there &apos;s enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when there &apos;s a sound next to it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the search for the right offer , senior citizens have different options , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if someone sings of the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior @-@ choir , one can easily join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
many senior cho@@ irs can also be found on the Internet .
those who do not have access to the internet may ask the family , friends or neighbours to help with the internet research .
those who want to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kl@@ ers .
singing is good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to any age .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than males at scre@@ ams of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover what effect the kil@@ n of k@@ itt@@ ens has on adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ st@@ erns didn &apos;t allow the males to be cold - however , they always kept the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of k@@ itt@@ ens at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster on lau@@ ts of k@@ itt@@ ens , who are in great need , as scientists have fi@@ gured out by the Veter@@ inary University and the Medical School Hannover ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
han@@ go@@ vers also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young animals for the males either are not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H .
she is the author of the study published on Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens shri@@ eks are different with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult males and eight female males were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a blast of little ones , taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated by mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger arous@@ ed k@@ itt@@ ens , who were additionally lifted up .
the researchers maintain their results despite the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who have not had their own offspring , responded to the cries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned around faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played off .
this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men on baby noises .
some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , whether they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former soccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ ses in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match is held in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul at the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even when the state of emergency was im@@ par@@ ted after the crash test in July , the government regre@@ t@@ ted that the everyday life of normal citizens should not be impaired .
this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the Movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
it does not stop before football .
the Prosec@@ ution filed an arrest warrant against the former strong i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r .
accordingly , he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group living in America .
Sü@@ kis@@ r is to be a follow@@ er of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who will be responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact this has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared an end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially fans of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bes@@ ik@@ tas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what the majority of the Turks unite in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ts .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at cup winner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially successful again on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top scor@@ er of his association .
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered at him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team to the tro@@ phy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record champion found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the pre @-@ rounds of K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also far@@ ed early in the Europa League .
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g it only reached rank six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year was better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 season hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ment@@ arius .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
according to the coup attempt , the Gom@@ ez , which had been signed at AC Florence , had announced after the coup attempt to do not return because of the political situation in the country after his European vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just needs to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Princip@@ al Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to do this , the storm would have to be prepared to for@@ ego about a third of its estimated 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man stated : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin , 34 @-@ year @-@ old , was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted Ath@@ le@@ tics @-@ sinners can only laugh at it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing continues to be the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ ova , who had been compla@@ ining after a dop@@ ing lock right before the games , was whi@@ st@@ led without mercy at her start ( 100 meters of chest ) .
a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene offered herself : she was still in the hall with an up@@ shot smile and provoked her appearance .
when I found that she wasn &apos;t going to get gold , the audience burst out into a storm .
but there are still many more sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here &apos;s an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex world champion even faster than before , it is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times champion had to leave a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after having been det@@ ecting the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had strong tooth@@ ache after surgery , and the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European Championship , was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the sent@@ in@@ ence and was locked for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the big gold favorite .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was positively tested in 2010 and locked 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement had been responsible , mut@@ ated Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete has been recognized as many med@@ als afterwards .
thus Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after he was discovered by him testosterone dop@@ ing .
in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to release Olympic Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the European Championships in 2006 for testosterone abuse .
the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games , which was also recognized by the 2008 Olympic Games , was given back to the CA@@ S International Court of Justice .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m , he is ranked number two of the World Ranking List .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record holder and gold favourite was tested positive only in May , but still may start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , notes on taking a forbidden dietary supplement were found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA turned out mil@@ dly and expi@@ red on July 13 .
bomb threat in Thailand - Austri@@ ans wounded - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered from cuts and had been treated in hospital , but I was able to leave it again .
her hom@@ ebo@@ und trip was planned for the beginning of September .
whether the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on are also affected by Austrian citizens , be unclear for now .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is constantly in contact with local authorities , such as waste .
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Nightlife .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday morning , two explo@@ sives went up again and another person was killed according to the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular seaside resort Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured according to police instructions .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a city cler@@ k .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower be@@ et in front of the Re@@ vier of the coastal police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ western coast , as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast , demanded several injuries .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said .
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said Army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ pol@@ av@@ ee , Friday morning to journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express himself on possible motives - but probably it is about the acts of Muslim rebels .
in the attacks , Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks did not arise in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage confined to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
the authorities have received secret information on imminent attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however , they have not been informed of the exact date and location .
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police reported their officials all over the country to enhance security around major government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings again , but mostly they are not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the next bom@@ b@@ ings , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommended its homepage to follow instructions from the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , trips to these provinces are dis@@ cour@@ aged from unnecessary journeys .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elabor@@ ated by the military jun@@ ta .
this also grants the military a great influence over the coming years .
jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to cause chaos , while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , who had seized the power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , re@@ inst@@ al@@ ises itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military has not managed to get a grip on the ri@@ fl@@ ing rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several national offices , the Constitutional Prot@@ ectors in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; in the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; we see evidence of aspir@@ ations against the basic democratic principles , &quot; said Constitutional Princip@@ al Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin .
in this way , immigrants from the Islamic faith or the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in an extrem@@ ist way .
this is why we are now observing the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity through alien@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; Identi@@ ties &quot; are already observed in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that his authority was closely aligned with the local authorities during the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Princip@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful voice , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as legal extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not advertising for your own cause .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
recently , there have been reports of contacts of the &quot; identity &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several German states .
Ma@@ ate said , he did not gain any knowledge .
possible contacts of this kind are only relevant for the constitutional protection only from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - will change its direction by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , and thus become extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not identi@@ fiable .
with a view to the marked increase in legitimate off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation , Ma@@ ison said that in this context he would not speak of new right terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we have found in recent years that there can be ri@@ gh@@ tist structures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may well be that other right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee streams , or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
but there is no indication of a nationwide or European @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism .
the previous groups were formed on the regional level or in social networks .
Ma@@ ison expressed concern that many attacks went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene .
that is the cause of concern .
many of the susp@@ ects in the event of attacks on asylum accommodations have not previously been known as criminals , politically motivated off@@ ences or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with legal extre@@ mi@@ sts who might have been politically in@@ different or voted for example , CD@@ U , SPD or left , which then became radi@@ cal@@ ised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist tendencies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its becomes an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records are not always able to determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center the slightly overweight float from Ethiopia was so slow that it could no longer be seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was then promoted to the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his race with a return of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly athletic figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming more popular in under@@ represented countries .
since most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ asi@@ t wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .

G@@ FR@@ P leadership reti@@ res after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges its boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of Executive Board Chairman Matthias Hart@@ mann will be all the more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the forefront of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after a further dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the resignation of the company management , the world &apos;s number five stands before a personal revival .
G@@ FR@@ P executive chef plans to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Gf@@ K supervisory board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert has already retired from the Supervisory Board effective September 12 .
the management board of the Board of Directors has already taken over the previous Executive Board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger as of September 1 , sharing the company with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he should officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spokesperson &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor has been found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a reason for the res@@ ign@@ ations , the company called &quot; different views &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation .
details wanted to mention a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who will be leading the market research company in the future is still unclear at present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in investor circles it was said on Friday , last but not least the disappointment about the continued success of the restructuring measures initiated years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K peak since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are still not visible after 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the recent bad fi@@ bre@@ glass business figures , any shareholders will eventually be rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that were the case with BMW , that would make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company did not have to stop its loss of loss in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , revenue was 6.1 percent lower than the comparative quarter of the previous year .
sales of EUR 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million fell by 3.4 percent in the first half of the year .
in view of its difficult economic situation , the profit in the second quarter was particularly bur@@ dened by the drop in value of the company .
the company value depreci@@ ation of 139 million euros , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience business area , under@@ lined the Group a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - the bus sli@@ ps into tren@@ ches in tren@@ ches : eight injured
in an accident involving a coach with 43 senior citizens as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ bu@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered serious injuries , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade her information , according to a vice @-@ president , who was driving partly on the counter@@ track .
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances arrived at the accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the last travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kru@@ mm@@ audi@@ tor district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the transpor@@ ter and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic meter waste water will take place from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl in 3.@@ 44 instead of previously 2.@@ 10 euros ; for allow@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate measures for improvement are necessary .
after an over@@ sle@@ eved calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the household by the council Office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was found that under@@ covers were used for these sewage systems .
due to the legal basis , the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the equipment cost @-@ effectively .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens and the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se .
the increase in fees is between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt displayed the panel , a new calculation of fees for the wastewater treatment plants of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , overl@@ apping or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period can also be equ@@ ated .
Schmidt explained that in all three wastewater facilities there are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water waste , which lies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters a year .
as a result of the low distribution base , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the volume of waste water in all three plants is slightly declining .
furthermore , in the past period of calculation , all three plants were not least due to their age of refurb@@ ishment and repair spending in a considerable extent .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the wastewater treatment system Az@@ endorf .
in the pump factory Wel@@ th@@ ahl , the almost 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and at the pond wastewater treatment in Lop@@ p , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be removed , the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation system had to be installed to comply with the water regulations in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses came from the continued assistance and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which are still considerably below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that the expenses for operation and maintenance were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the three plants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs in the wastewater facilities has been spar@@ ed over the past 20 years .
the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the long term , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al wastewater treatment association will not be able to wi@@ den these facilities because it is a deficit disorder .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that in July , inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was compared to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of July ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; Restaurants and Hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; different goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .

snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be made of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are imm@@ ac@@ ulate , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mal@@ missions will go to the public .
in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have attracted criticism in which they were accused that the app Black@@ face would promote or promote white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week suggested a filter to some users , who gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow @-@ spotted . &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a larger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and indignation were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat@@ ted shared that it would have disabled this feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended to pay homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others rejected the Ani@@ me comparison .
in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widely used across the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and said to be unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face has been moved to the ex@@ iting extreme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling block . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ chat &apos;s large audience of young people - who are more di@@ vers@@ er than their older counter@@ parts - could expect to expect sensitivity .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who worked as Product Manager and Engineering for Medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that rapid controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the setting practices at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu , for the great part , critici@@ zed white , only male leadership and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ am chat .
&quot; either they do not have diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chin@@ es@@ ich @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Snap@@ chat largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his associates , but according to a speaker , the company recently recru@@ ited a staff responsible to focus on under@@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu also said that she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence , establishes committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence to draw up a more optimistic view of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site , reported an investigation committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Republi@@ can Task Force , reports of great dis@@ content among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence information typically attracted by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ com Com@@ man@@ ders reported a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
the leadership errors in the Cent@@ com range to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government tips have given directions under Obama to change reports , it shows how analysts looked at the pressure from their superi@@ ors , a more optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than it corresponds to the facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com member announced publicly that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , continues to remain under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command &apos;s leaders changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans launched the Task Force after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information as the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com Reports are underway with the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the news service committee on Thursday released their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the Republi@@ can Task Force &apos;s conclusions .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly limited trial for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest @-@ level demo@@ crat in the Committee , Member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this process , Mr Schiff , delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ aged the morality among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was little room for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats gave no evidence of a White House intervention in the Cent@@ com analysts in regard to a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preliminary results of the investigation were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s general In@@ spec@@ tor , who was accepted after complaints from Cent@@ com An@@ al@@ ysts .
l@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon &apos;s spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the reports of the Congress , while the investigations of the general inspec@@ tor were still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts at times have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense greet a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of the military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State , reminiscent of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush fores@@ aw only a small occup@@ ying force in Iraq and little time preten@@ ding to be concerned about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in revol@@ t against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , according to government agencies , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker dict@@ ated that contrary to the statements of the government air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , they had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft refin@@ eries were put into service to sell oil on the black market .
however , this finding was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
the United States won fourth match in women &apos;s field Ho@@ ckey , a show@@ down with the UK is ahead
one day after she had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ ete@@ am of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games were supposed to represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in the memory .
however , they know that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ on on the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain unbe@@ aten .
great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed will take the strong Dutch somewhat longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
however the game might go out on Saturday , the American women have triggered a surprising verteb@@ ra@@ e through their success story , four years after they landed in the past London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey ra@@ cket in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , became coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things to a better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical shift , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we have now .
we have been able to break the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the Tor@@ row in the first half of the game with a return stroke from the near area .
India had entered the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed themselves surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and kno@@ cked the ball in the gate for the American female to get a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US door@@ keeper , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , as late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel stable and in@@ es@@ capable , a fast relay between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is as if the olymp@@ ic torch itself was a burning rod , which is passed by the cross@@ bow to a swi@@ mmer to the gym@@ n@@ ast for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coff@@ es@@ hop without listening to Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ opa@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s s@@ warm with dimples , could have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ TV advertising , if he were a swi@@ mmer , gym@@ n@@ ast or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the olymp@@ ic gymnas@@ tics tournament .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports which are not generally recognized : air pist@@ ol shooting , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it reign for a long time .
but if I should make modest arguments for my particular favourite , then let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete char@@ me of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , it became so spar@@ se the last 16 years that many of those , I had questioned , did not know that it is at all an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to compete , it has never won a medal in the trampoline jump and until 2012 had had an athlete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for their wives .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider charm , partly because it is suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear suitable for a c@@ lown school than for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but an enthusiastic enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ful trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending bul@@ ging - but also the gra@@ ci@@ ousness of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that it essentially combines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up @-@ and @-@ coming vic@@ tors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot at almost 30 feet in the air and must have a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ acking and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
according to official Olympic programme , they are assessed according to their performance , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to move forward in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and back , upwards and down on the playground .
not only do they hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also a further high goal in television transmission : that of the world or the Olympics .
the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator into tears .
but it is also what I feel ti@@ res@@ ome when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing spell .
the trampoline v@@ ector is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly upwards .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can be .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; that of the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the end @-@ hours as part of a fort@@ night block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the middle of the Olympic Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear @-@ monkey and the obj@@ ectivity of male athletes - as the male U.S. Tur@@ ner recently proposed - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his air @-@ rin@@ ding , new fan community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia are pushing for violent resistance from the government .
witnesses say that tens of prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police in gun@@ shots .
is Ethiopia to break it together ?
in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy .
but in recent months , protests erup@@ ted against the government and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people r@@ ushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organizations , the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security officers beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a thorough investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is cher@@ ished by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism beyond the region , especially in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western aid .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ ses of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you &apos;re op@@ pressing people and they don &apos;t have any other options except prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia .
the whole youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
after a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time tensions continue along the Er@@ it@@ rea border ; a fight for this fragile , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ ga@@ o Liberation Front or the O@@ ga@@ den National Liberation Front ( O@@ ga@@ den ) , who in recent years have been more or less forced to use tur@@ mo@@ il and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ ing after years of before bending under the surface are now explo@@ ding .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years have very many Ethiop@@ ians been able to communicate with the social media , since cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians en@@ acted that they were so prot@@ esting .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia &apos;s predominantly Christian countries , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but that is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ per@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ per@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is being dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , accounting for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third reason for the tur@@ mo@@ il is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death on an un@@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness .
he was regarded as tactical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts are saying that he was particularly vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to process enemies and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after prot@@ esting thousands of elections which , according to analysts , apparently sp@@ lash@@ ed from the government and subsequently stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it was less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest passed relatively quickly .
developing experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ use of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , attacked by Tig@@ ray managed businesses and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more common in the social media .
analysts are saying that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for emergency flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it has closed that base .
while West@@ ern@@ ers clearly want to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin congrat@@ ulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp declares Obama &apos;s claim that IS@@ IS was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to sc@@ atter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were not meant seriously by the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State .
this clari@@ fication raises new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings about his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful period , in the particular position to explain statements he might not have meant .
after making an announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp challenged the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret , the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the Conserv@@ ative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can candidate wished to know nothing about it .
the last storm of criticism stum@@ bles upon Mr. Tru@@ mp as he tried to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation due to falling demand values .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again .
talking about Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found his speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already advanced sar@@ cas@@ m in his defense .
at the end of July he raised strong criticism when he thought the Russians were to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; Of course I said that sar@@ c@@ astically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic borders in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then possibly &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tru@@ mp assumed an even more corro@@ sive tone , as his demand values declined .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a leadership with great advantage in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp tries to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics of distor@@ ting his asser@@ tions or mis@@ understanding his humour .
but while rein@@ forcing the focus of attention over the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp thu@@ ze has brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his asser@@ tions may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , was struggling to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani told him about the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS an almost unknown , small organisation he named them back@@ bit@@ ers , completely wrong , and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most of the mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister for Foreign Affairs , IS@@ IS allowed it to spread by allowing it to take control of the situation in the Middle East .
ahead of the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of riding on each of his words and taking action against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tru@@ mp as just a further proof that he was un@@ fit for the presidential office .
once pushed over the price from the market , Cafe in Green@@ point comes back
verb Cafe was a big@@ oted café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store were sup@@ planted .
soap Cher@@ ie &apos;s store , which replaced Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
native Americans claimed it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ ale wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel exemp@@ ted , and verb is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is change , then it is also new invention .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time staff of the old cafés , the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide money for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment too .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ n@@ ishes like cap@@ ers and aci@@ dic onion .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café does not serve beer any more , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed out by awards from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , previously lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the verb regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the verb had been closed , she gave up coffee drinking for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realised that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the club in 2003 .
he went there before work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment about the fact that the soap business had taken the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for tasting with the coffee bre@@ wed in the coffee shop as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will still go on their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new client translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he proposed to leave them soon so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice restaurant would like to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands to an adjacent building .
for many customers , a new verb goes out to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rich meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a delic@@ acy President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a f@@ ai@@ ble for hat@@ ching delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water@@ tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was somewhat more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as a dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to Americans how to eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick was told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal &quot; which will be published by Har@@ per Verlag on Tuesday , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , local snack at Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key ate with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable blend .
when the re@@ porter booked Hack@@ grill , this found the couple suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; said Ziegel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver lo@@ af and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has to be placed in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ in @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cook for male ri@@ co@@ ons and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; draws the paths with which the country was converting , not to be the Cock@@ a@@ ig@@ ne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was equally ten@@ se : mysterious meals such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ole were stap@@ le food , the K@@ asser@@ ol@@ le was considered a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man noticed , as chefs were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury .
strange bl@@ ends have been tried out because a high @-@ calorie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction took preced@@ ence over taste or even wholes@@ ome food .
while resear@@ ching the book , which also includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish of this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular additive at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions are not matched to each other .
it was typical for many of the laundry recipes .
as never before , or since then , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - have such an approach to eating habits in the country .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household polic@@ emen , &quot; and the challenge to transform pamp@@ h@@ lets such as creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially tasty are the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ Me @-@ Cake @-@ eating stance .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farm kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million @-@ million man of the world he had become .
&quot; he liked continental dishes like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and carried a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was marvell@@ ously realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt , a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors , caused the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country was back on its legs .
the legacy is based on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to foods .
the couple stated in writing the book the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law better understood - for example how they could not throw food away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brick was rec@@ alled : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind@@ fall .
after the plates were cleared off at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e issued a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt did for lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , and added that it was a common plo@@ y to miss a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each one di@@ pped somewhat reluct@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ anned , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad .
Co@@ E took three times a supplement .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil defence group which according to Bild @-@ Zeitung has saved almost 60@@ ,000 people .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the deck to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the area of war .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the Civil Defence , showing him in an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an infant from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never saw himself as a hero , but he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is true ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have cast four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the toxic rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that children do not play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture rec@@ ites his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Green@@ lan@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ rate is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland ha@@ ie usually only come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland hairs only get up with 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in one hour it gets on average just 1,@@ 220 meters far .
only when it matters , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle characterized by slow@@ ness , however , seems to be a patent recipe for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case from a Greenland shar@@ k , which could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland would become stone @-@ old .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland hairs are hard to observe , after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures of about six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the way of life in Greenland .
their slow @-@ motion @-@ pent@@ aph@@ s measured them when they buried six animals with one transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
nevertheless , these sh@@ arks make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
perhaps they chase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers , that tor@@ ches out of higher water @-@ layers .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland ha@@ ie , which caught fishermen from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest of them measured 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is already born before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had eye @-@ catching much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear tests carried out large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimet@@ res , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all larger Greenland hairs , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lens nucle@@ us , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res is even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
the researchers were now able to associate an old age .
as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age at 156 years was determined , Greenland ha@@ ie with the increase obviously allow for at least one and a half centuries .
this should also be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is not by chance that such Meth@@ us@@ ali@@ es live mainly in icy waters .
the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland whale , whose bacon at the neck stuck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon head , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us .
so they mature later - and age more slowly .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals often become particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal gets warm .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal , on the other hand , should invest more resources in a long life .
building site in double pack
in the recent meeting , the Municipal Council has focuss@@ ed on topics related to building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Board accepted the announcement of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recently proved residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , plot and development issues were clari@@ fied and the applications could be sur@@ vey@@ ed , the sale of plots in the residential building areas of the road &quot; road &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( division 1 ) is nothing more in the way to interested parties .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau meet young families and other senior citizens alike .
as it was said , construction workers can now register at the town hall as of now , and the municipal council is expected to discuss the allocation of the plots in its September session .
in order to be able to meet requests for the establishment of further industrial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan in sub @-@ sections only in the spring of this year .
in the area of Unter@@ am@@ lar@@ n , the area that has already been designated there is extended by two par@@ c@@ els towards state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the River Main thus has the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Compet@@ ence Center Financial Markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether they are allowed to continue operating from London from financial transactions across the EU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU passport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they have received approval in the UK so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are currently using large US banks .
several banks have already announced that they should reloc@@ ate jobs .
the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; comp@@ utes with 10@@ 000 new jobs on the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight of the largest banks in the euro area , and other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk category ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is headquartered , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks , since they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , it is also po@@ orer in terms of infrastructure as well as Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
in addition , the city is home to readily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , rental properties for first @-@ rate commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition due to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime .
in a ranking of the Mer@@ cer consulting firm , the city ranked 7th , Luxembourg on No. 19 , Dublin at No. 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; with its strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W concludes .
but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my business researchers .
according to figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US official decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was freed from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two Mer@@ ck patents , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the opinion and other un@@ ethical actions .
when the law@@ suit was collected on Thursday , US Director of Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the cost incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to syn@@ dic@@ ate with Gilead , which has dominated the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications , which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck su@@ ed each other and claim ownership of laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
backed by the United States , troops say they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
backed by the United States , troops have taken full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , a spokes@@ man for the group said on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ CS ) are comb@@ ing after the departure of the still remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city , currently the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they liberated over 2,000 civilians , held by the fighters as ho@@ stages , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters , al@@ lied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are currently carrying out clean @-@ up work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday , her tax return for 2015 , which resulted in an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million for the Democrats and her husband , an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated US $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former Secretary of State Bill Clinton earned an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for their book on their term at the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ i@@ dency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax statements for the past ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri announced in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp is hiding behind false speeches and re@@ trac@@ ers in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax statements .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations although they are not oblig@@ ated by law .
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have given a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; they are on the move , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign hero@@ in Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , regarding the publication of the Democrats candidate .
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp Special Ad@@ visor said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to release something before tax inspections are not completed .
Tru@@ mp critics , among other things the Republi@@ can candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding wealth , his donations for charity organizations , his business , and various other compounds , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already fallen on the subject and posted a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp promp@@ ts us to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke about the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Politi@@ co has reported that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday that this might still be the case .
federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton is supporting a regulation named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat here , at a meeting to exchange its tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had also been subjected to an I@@ RS tax check and Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before voters and not in front of tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published a tax return until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
Clinton &apos;s tax return from 2015 showed that they purchased just USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans .
their major investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ work bodies support Tanz@@ anian Ele@@ ph@@ ant protection
wildlife conserv@@ ation@@ ers in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going live in people inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had the idea for years , intensified its promotion along with the US nature protection by practi@@ sing volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non@@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and harvest without viol@@ ating animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is the day of the World &apos;s Day which is dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in attitudes within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without doing harm to the elephant , &quot; said CEO of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the f@@ use cord .
when it is ign@@ ited , the con@@ dom explo@@ des with a knob and spra@@ ys fine dust at ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der into the air .
a breath is usually already out to chase the elephant .
one last chance is a shi@@ pper that shoots a gold @-@ turn fire@@ work into the air , causing a loud , light explosion .

Jewish director dis@@ ap@@ points Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election has been removed after &quot; Arab &quot; promp@@ ting - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media clock after announ@@ cing that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin didn &apos;t list any Israeli pre @-@ election because it had called for Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentation &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel in the hotel &apos;s country selection list .
however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
written by Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own Call Center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sent him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel employee said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it was even more fur@@ ious in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election be er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the employee of Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather big response on the Internet , in which people called it a sc@@ andal .
some enter@@ tained the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there would have been the supposed &quot; re@@ for@@ estation of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another post that has been pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , stands near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly referred to all alle@@ gations and called the incident a &quot; mistake &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; there has never been a direct assignment &quot; to not include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police sets tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police replaced lac@@ ri@@ mal gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which caused the police to use rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the proposals of the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the protest participants saw gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional president Michel Tim@@ er on walls .
the recent protests erup@@ ted a few days after protest@@ ors went into the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the exchange rate between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent year on year .
since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted , interest in Russian companies on businesses grew strongly in the country , distributed the ambassador .
Russian companies start existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the exchange rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade break has been achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this year , D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia .
last year , the Russian delegation represented around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries concerning the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d that preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
witnesses sought : beverage market inv@@ aded in forest fire oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack on Thursday evening has been carried out on the Be@@ verage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces , demanded the release of cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled at first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
the police do not share much of the amount of money .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters large , thus relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is badly visible .
after the raid , the perpetr@@ ators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg , and from the gravel parking lot located opposite the park entrance to the car park with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in direction B 256 ( Schla@@ derer n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations about the crime time ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y attack must urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : fun and fun during the summer season
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and youth of the socio @-@ educational daily group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their car@@ ers at their summer time in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
during the first week of school , the life @-@ joyful group was quartered in the calm@@ ly situated Lei@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle .
several day @-@ to @-@ day excursions were on the agenda .
on the one hand we went to B@@ anks with the visit of the match z@@ oos .
on the other hand , after Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special nursery in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion took us to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Celtic Museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group enjoyed themselves at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swim and pl@@ unge .
children and car@@ ers with their own prepared dishes such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ger Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were treated with culinary delights .
in workshops there was cur@@ ated , beautiful jewelry made of beads and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game .
other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Color@@ ful E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot;
on the day of the journey home , the sun and the children laugh@@ ed at home .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the altar @-@ stran@@ ts from the soul care unit Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way for a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were met .
in order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all the mini @-@ stran@@ ts in two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ rant lap St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a several @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations have been examined and one finally decided to visit the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage goal was offered to Freiburg Cathedral .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ene , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Hei@@ ligen@@ kreuz were on their way .
in the evening before , Pastor C@@ anc@@ t sent the pilgrims in a small ceremony in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms and informed the pilgrims .
from Hor@@ b to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Mu@@ en@@ ster Un@@ ser@@ er is a wife and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started .
the individual tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a short pulse with different prayers , songs and written texts .
but even on the way , the Min@@ is at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches always took a rest to sing together a song from a specially produced par@@ is@@ hi@@ on@@ ist song booklet .
the dormit@@ ories of the local par@@ ishes were available for overnight stays .
at the stage destinations , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided a tasty and tonic dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we passed Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the next step was to take the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but had to fall down about 500 metres altitude at the Rin@@ gier heat and then climbed again .
in the evening the deserved reward was a common barbecue at the swimming pond .
after the morning pulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg cathedral in the later afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy .
with a small impulse God was thank@@ ed here .
the Min@@ is of Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t , who arrived at the pilgrimage destination , were welcomed at the evening mass in Münster .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
in the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Brit@@ on wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner spent the last evening in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made to E@@ igen . the J@@ utes made the legend hau@@ ghty when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from New Zealand &apos;s favor@@ ites .
four years ago England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the World Championships in London despite the resignation of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a hin@@ der .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement generated a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton attempted to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the bul@@ k@@ head that is now un@@ folding .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y , who won four years ago with Ho@@ y - and Sk@@ inner set an Olympic champion in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ des fell short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , in which Hin@@ des went to a higher gear to slow it down and make it Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we set up an Olympic champion in the final round and defeated the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ y , Hin@@ des admitted that he intentionally dropped on the track after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
in such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels with all the UK flags on the platform like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have gotten so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the velo@@ drome .
with the form Kenn@@ y it &apos;s in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ y &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( an apparently holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a hi@@ ve of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same as Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will take three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old boy from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should become a k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race .
they arrived at the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record that won gold in London 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday , he had been argu@@ ing with representatives before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his body size .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and completed tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archive of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie will be in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a bunch of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
Dra@@ mas played in the background , so the resignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director , in April , in the midst of sex@@ ism and mo@@ bbing , as well as the retirement of magn@@ itu@@ des such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , when you look at the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks like the legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the moment , can be repeated again .
future of the melting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy contract question@@ able
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the system operator announces the energy supply contract and will lift up all supply contracts , as the energy company delivers .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision at Victoria beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the facility .
the subsi@@ dy , which is set for 20 years , will exp@@ ire in November .
there are up to 2,000 work@@ stations in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the enam@@ el consum@@ es around 10 percent of the entire power generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa concluded the Point Henry sm@@ el@@ ting , which led last year to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the Al@@ coa distill@@ ery in Port@@ land loses money and risks closure .
this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , where Chinese companies C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melt @-@ melt , &quot; the company announced .
AG@@ L also said that the contracts were called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions , &quot; which should have entered into effect from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the business year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on revenues from AG@@ L as of the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that the value of the contracts had already been written down in its annual financial year in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; expectation of a termination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ as ... to run the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which would have entered into force from November this year even though there is still an explanation of why it has res@@ igned from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the sector before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt mill in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that each year Port@@ land uses around 600 MW and Tom@@ ago to consume about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity .
should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a substantial reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hy@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner clan Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the view of this cover made me cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) , a wei@@ rd reality video that shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z @-@ Un@@ cle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , which ends with a classic twist : they all planned a surprise party .
this represents the stere@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ cked act almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the phrase , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon girl on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , surely a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim may have struck what the vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were looking forward to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most sold @-@ out edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles a picture band rather than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Ac@@ cor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover star is so eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine filtered out before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar Award winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even at the low chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties aren &apos;t related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if it &apos;s all about Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , released on the last cover , was one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers does not like success to everyone .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enni@@ fer &apos;s position in the world of fashion has always been ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ised and called them &quot; the mi@@ st@@ ents of the moment . &quot;
these feelings came up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the vo@@ gue cover .
but to travel around on the disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells pictures from C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is seen in Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal Centr@@ es Indi@@ c@@ ates 160@@ ,000 People every year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s emergency services are rejected annually by the community centres , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further mid @-@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ u@@ sions and similar - are rejected by their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already operating over@@ ly , are ready for further reductions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year , it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l Joint Research Centr@@ es revealed that the last survey of the National Union of Community Human@@ itarian Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worsen@@ ed without repe@@ aling the resolution of the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , which means that thousands of people from important services you need are rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent connections , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismissed un@@ ju@@ stly - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funding by 30 percent , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the Federal Prosecutor and Federal Ju@@ dge of Justice as well as Sen@@ ators from Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately susp@@ end these funds , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid on the national average .
it is now time to see the needs of the community centers and their communities and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k invested in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp campaign accused of recru@@ iting staff
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign has been charged with alleged in@@ action after announ@@ cing that her campaign manager for North Carolina put a fire@@ arm on a staff while traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment , which was submitted on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
B@@ ordin@@ i admitted for months to have been waiting for the matter to be regulated internally before he realized that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : pol@@ l on countries @-@ elections : losing SPD and CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , considerable losses for the governing parties of the SPD and the CD@@ U are notable .
this resulted in representative surveys conducted by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rule in the north , this is not possible according to the survey figures in Berlin .
but in both federal states the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to face the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD collap@@ sed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party only smil@@ ed shortly before the CD@@ U , which could come again to 23 percent .
the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag .
despite light losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated at 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) into the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 per cent respectively .
according to the survey , the German Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) according to the survey was only 23 percent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached 23.@@ 4 percent only by 18 percent .
they are still smiling behind the Gre@@ ens at 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would , in contrast to 2011 , miss the entrance .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in slow motion : the Nokia Communic@@ ator was launched 20 years ago .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the unit weighed almost half a kilogra@@ m and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be sufficient today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few Euros , fans can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
but 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone maker announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; office in the West pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new cell phone was able to receive a lot for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator has to be reached .
even accessing websites was possible by using HTML browsers , even if tor@@ menting slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could have gu@@ essed that Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smart phone era in August 1996 .
everything has changed since then .
smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &apos; mobile phone business experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
today , the market is dominated by suppliers , all of whom came later than Nokia .
being online always and everywhere , this is everyday for a lot of people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users around the world .
about 1.4 billion units were sold , and Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales of the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
a whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone .
the crucial breakthrough to the mass market came first in early 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone on Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , everything by touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march , still today , the iPhone is the company &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry domin@@ antly dominated the market .
they finally disappeared , black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ x now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
today , every German today looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to get the smartphone away even once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Kugel , the Siemens Board of Human Resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , permanent availability is regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must steer the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring innovation and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London when we ran a great effort to ensure all our nations and regions benefited from the Games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we will alone create 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the extension of He@@ ath@@ row is too great .
I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ eless on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ ishers had wron@@ ged in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for single an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in natural growth and a legacy of skills and jobs to leave the airport as well as in the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget - from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the midst of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I &apos;m confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad blocking
for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to b@@ ypass advertising block@@ ages are the same as a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ings on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post where it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding with regard to its adver@@ ts , to make it difficult to identify which part of the page advertising is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this type of hate @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the time @-@ provo@@ king open source community and the b@@ ans has already been underway since the invention of ad lock@@ ers , &quot; and that Facebook is soon to come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has embark@@ ed on the struggle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators for the industry have become wor@@ rying .
according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , worldwide use about 200 million people display block@@ ers ; nearly four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users who access their mobile devices on Facebook , mobile advertising generates 84 percent of the advertising revenue of Facebook .
the company has said that mobile advertis@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m sharing a speaker .
advertisement on Desktop PCs makes a large share of revenues so that Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step as re@@ warding .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; ad preferences pool &quot; in order to control people with more control over them .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that new blocks would cause new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a silent tool , which is why we instead focus on developer tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences so as to put more control in people &apos;s hands .
woman with suspected suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police are calling witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that at the age of 49 a Swiss woman , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police told them to call them and every witness of the incident to report themselves .
an investig@@ ative process was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , shared Gil@@ les Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter with Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a clas@@ h avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held responsible .
in each of the two cases - in which a person was running in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that the drivers didn &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent murder , after crossing and killing a man who was lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious in the street , and accepted the court .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman who responded to an emergency call came into a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; totally extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has more information about the incident near Morges , should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably hab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA air model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies from NASA developed a model to explore the past of Venus with tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus with its hot , water @-@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could once have re@@ buff@@ ed Earth @-@ like conditions .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably rejected more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to host life and protected from quicker evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS Model Simul@@ ation@@ ist the slow rotation of Venus ex@@ poses its daylight side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than those of the earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus , similar to evolution previously thought by planet researchers .
although it was probably hab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their steam was burned away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide has remained with a deadly greenhouse effect - the Venus , which as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins A@@ val@@ an@@ che as trainer
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately seek a new coach .
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
over the summer I have thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organization and we wish him the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded the best coach of the league during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as winner of the Jack Adams Award .
he led the club on 112 points and ranked first in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell below the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot at the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Gallery and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
North @-@ East @-@ workers resume talks again , put on strike
the labour disputes relating to remuneration for the North Sea workers are suspended , while all the parties in the dispute are placed on the table for a new round of discussion , negoti@@ ators said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were conducted spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to restart the wra@@ pping process of the current strike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold several full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks starting next year to restart the problems .
the unions said their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has cut the rates of its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company &apos;s rating is followed by a 10 % reduction in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company said that additional cuts to the company provide the required space in order to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released for its part thousands of people and plans to give up its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which had reinforced the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion spent on spending new projects in the North Sea , compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler &apos;s Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers gather the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates , and in which context the rotation @-@ time periods are associated with the planet creation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star enh@@ aces , we can learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light @-@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now the fastest .
at peak rotation rates , these mature stars po@@ ke large amounts of star@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star is ageing , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by identifying the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars are turning slower than solid stars .
Reb@@ ull compared the stars with dancers , with bigger stars rotating more slowly pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
as the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rotation rates .
&quot; the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is still much ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and so to speak hang up their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball player ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional withdrawal , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will be wearing the Tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m saying goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; declared the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the league , and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him $ 27 million a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with a full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he abol@@ ished some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics show similar values .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old still shouldn &apos;t be recorded in the bas@@ eball hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square .
already in 2009 , the super@@ star admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; banned from ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , due to a development in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal , it was closed for 2@@ 11 games by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the prime suspect for having received high @-@ performance funding over an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida for years .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could have done a favour for me for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said in a swe@@ e@@ the@@ art at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends have survived the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to Cameron Di@@ az and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson , was told with sympathy and sympathy of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e rival Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the trailer sang with the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez @-@ Team .
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ec@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases

on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterfly , just 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have been invited to take part in the 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing .
the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Tribunal for ACT and will accept the judgment . &quot;
for the first time in history it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ec@@ owa by , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tics specialist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to be the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O in the forbidden substance .
Dan@@ ec@@ owa has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ rehear@@ sal will also have a positive impact .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately contacted the athlete with criticism of the athlete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t pull the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation cannot participate in Rio .
on Friday the event &quot; Adrian Dest@@ in@@ sky , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier positively on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both deny the intake , but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the athletes start , especially the case of Dan@@ ec@@ owa is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF World Association banned the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing the start , also the runner @-@ up nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the previous ver@@ ges in China had also taken care of violent clas@@ hes between the athletes .
so the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ ass .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also at the centre of a debate with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun had a positive impact on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din in 2014 , but had to leave only a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ out hack@@ ers their ran@@ som
programm@@ ers of contact malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in this process .
according to a recent survey by the malware @-@ defense specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , some times victim of an attack using black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the goal of ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the required ran@@ som to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software to attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially resulting ran@@ som will be significantly higher than for private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling rapid evolution of malware , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 most of the mal@@ functions were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place quickly in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware actively works for a simple pattern : once on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches specifically for recently modified files such as Word , Excel or Database files as well as for archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and delete the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail press .
in order to get the final code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin - .
but where private users find the personal photo database on the game , companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases without stopping production .
accordingly , the damage is higher if a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of German companies reported revenue losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had even had to cancel business operations completely , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of perpetr@@ ators in the face of stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ acker again know that and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure examined the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ heads and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free sample files .
and if private people are rede@@ emed after payments of a few hundred euros , companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to return their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ kl@@ ess gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers are becoming more and more professional and share the work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus company SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the programm@@ ers then sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual black@@ mail .
the so @-@ called malware Kits were created by purchasing malware , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; included is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ mail@@ ers then search for further hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so one logs in one of the forums on the underground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals then commission sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is known by many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey rely on rep@@ elling ran@@ som@@ ware by file back @-@ ups and scanning software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful measurement , the perpetr@@ ators will instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the type of data , the potential for damage is much higher than before .
in the future , the perpetr@@ ators will also be able to take completely new targets on the internet of things on the grain .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating might well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda will pack everything in the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe , and the versatility of a mini van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear , it doesn &apos;t work closely at all .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the top of the cockpit is slightly different .
the HR @-@ V is much more versatile than comparable vehicles .
not only does a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l be available for folded back rests and 10@@ 26 l , but the Magic Se@@ ats are available .
this is less magical than it sounds : the rear seats of the rear bench can be folded up like seats and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor up to ceiling .
the luggage compartment is well loaded , but the loading height is 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V power@@ fully , thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm .
however , his work is likely to be somewhat qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the city emergency brake assistant ( works up to pace 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assist .
the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles in manoeu@@ v@@ ring as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the remote @-@ light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller responds to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if necessary .
the full connectivity , however , is only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped Top Diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with Euro 6 emissions standards .
with the HR @-@ V Honda provides a versatile and everyday car .
airline is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) ar@@ gues that liability is only conceivable if dangers are typical of aviation .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of illness : when does the organizer pay
after their trip , ill holi@@ day@@ makers only get money back when the cause of the disease is to be found in the hotel without a doubt .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have been shown to show the same symptoms .
in the case of the trial , a family had severe diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their tur@@ key lau@@ ght .
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
their illness brought back the holi@@ day@@ makers to a defective sewage treatment plant , which was supposed to contam@@ inate the sea water .
the family believed that the trip was lacking - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
in fact , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then , he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his information obligations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially since no contamination was found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion to one another - is a general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 ill .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said that violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July would have caused many people to worry about further attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state must be pru@@ dent and determined at the same time to respond to terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
surely , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division .
we won &apos;t grant this triumph to terrorists .
if perpetr@@ ators should have to leave the country more quickly , this increases the security and strength of the people for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a realization of the proposals up to the Bundestag election 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personal reinforcement of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a medium @-@ four @-@ digit order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be re@@ proved once more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance should be improved , the right to arms will be am@@ ended , making it more difficult to buy weapons on the internet .
the last much discussed duty of confidentiality for physicians is to be kept in mind after de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to look for solutions to reduce the risk of the citizens , &quot; he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities .
in order to counter@@ act the ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère plans the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the interior minister clearly spoke against action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a cow@@ ard@@ stick for the sharp@@ sho@@ ot@@ ers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel told the papers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union following a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of dual citizenship .
a general prohibition of full wear is constitu@@ tionally problematic for constitutional law .
you can &apos;t ban everything you reject and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules for example in road traffic or for witnesses to court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green boss Sim@@ one Peter designed the minister , he wanted to simulate with ever new anti @-@ terrorist acts of action and ability to act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet S@@ prü@@ che and a tightening of the right of residence permit people in this country no longer safe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the free@@ way feeder
it is regularly st@@ owed on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this is to change : the legal balance needs to be extended .
this is good news for all drivers who are driving in traffic on the environmental street every evening in traffic jams when they drive over the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , road construction will be extended by 700 meters in the area between the Hammer Street and the Wes@@ eler Straße exit .
drivers can then thread directly from the hammer street to the right .
the major advantage : traffic is sharing early on , thus improving the overall workflow on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder anno@@ ys drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days from the back @-@ sta@@ u to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes beyond .
the reason is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here on , the traffic is only one @-@ lane guided over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt several years ago .
the reason for this is that static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity , in order to record mainly heavy @-@ duty traffic .
the competent regional business cannot say how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the related tim@@ ed traffic will continue .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official rest period until 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal bio @-@ regulation , the state enterprise consciously chose the traffic weaker time during the school holidays , because with disabilities is to be expected .
traffic will be passed on to the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
cross @-@ cultural trip : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the forest school visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the society N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Mu@@ en@@ ster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Children &apos;s House Wald@@ schule &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; Das Un@@ seen House &quot; of the Junge Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; initiated by the N@@ ima Society , 19 pupils between the age of 11 and 15 visited the production in the small house .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project .
most of the youngsters of the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boy Theater Münster .
N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ ys , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season within the framework of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background are expected to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language training are in the planning phase .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the star @-@ bu@@ ff @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern a stroke in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the sky spectacle , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope lies on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many shooting stars in the sky .
the star @-@ shed is Per@@ sei@@ den , that with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour is one of the quick@@ est shooting stars .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us that rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , one passes etern@@ ally , at night , one lies awake for hours , in the morning it is no longer to think of sleep far before the wake @-@ up ring .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of the adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons behind them , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , member of the board of the German Association for S@@ leep Medicine and S@@ leep Medicine .
what one understands for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. a sleeping and sleeping disorder .
many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of directors of the German Home Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs .
in@@ frequently , sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is particularly common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ alth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors require each other .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can lie badly , wake every two to three hours and begin to greet problems and worries about everyday problems and worries .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I sleep with a doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are com@@ promised during the day should go to the doctor , advises them .
the impairment can look quite different : you are beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache .
to allevi@@ ate the sleep problem , it is important to find out the causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medicines - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
Dr. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Research Center at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , will hardly be present in Germany .
therefore , in case of sleep problems , one should first turn to the doctor at home , advises them on the advice .
this can be clari@@ fied by examining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep , and what happens ?
in order to investigate the sleep laboratory , doctors advise doctors , for example , in snor@@ ing with breathing difficulties , in case of sickness , sleep@@ iness , sleep@@ wal@@ kers , or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etze explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just ask no nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after covering , one goes to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes in the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a probe at the finger .
there is also a camera on the ceiling of the sleeping person .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of screws where you can sit for a better sleep .
it is not too long to sleep in bed , don &apos;t watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and don &apos;t look at the watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s not condu@@ ci@@ ve to it .
what the jungle camp has with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ ty comments on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cut of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he first scored gold at the short @-@ track world championships in Doh@@ a and simultaneously set up his first world record .
the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ ty has now protected himself against his ex @-@ team @-@ mates standing in front of his criticism via Facebook .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets € 20,000 bonus and a king of jungle 150@@ ,000 € should not be surprised by missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night .

airport : gang of baggage theft arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , the police thu@@ gs of the Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men between 50 and 61 years of age .
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and baggage theft pil@@ es .
at 21.@@ 30 p.m. , civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf airport recognised a gang that was known to polic@@ emen from past theft crimes .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences this year since the middle of July .
the specialists of the det@@ ective com@@ miss@@ ary 34 can demonstrate four actions to the thi@@ eves who had been recru@@ ited to commit criminal off@@ ences to Germany .
they carried a total of more than 15.000 Euro .
old buildings , a few lime tree ponds , and a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stone streets in between : the Rig@@ a@@ er Strasse in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in is not at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
walking along the road from east to west you pass play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bike shop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has spra@@ yed onto the façade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , it is already being built : a house with high windows and 133 new apartments should be built here by 2017 .
article about this &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , however , is preferred over the past few weeks with burning cars .
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , now the residents have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Henkel had spoken several times for a hard action by the police against the project , the area designated as a &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on June 22 the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been cleared with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolling the police three weeks of official asser@@ tions with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers went down under the che@@ ering of sympath@@ isers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of houses in the sun , others talk about late .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who mainly trains three children , are mainly gener@@ ously protected by the police presence .
with the residents of the house projects , they share the concern of increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wishes mostly police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ ating left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin sen@@ ator and the police make up between home occup@@ ants and their neighbors , apparently does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in , east of Berlin , was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood , which in comparison to the rest of the city has a low average and a high risk of poverty .
in 1990 , many houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost the entire main street in the vicinity of the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been cleared in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world . residents of East Germany and former occup@@ ants now share their neighbourhood with them .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them at dis@@ mounted windows or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were thrown with paint bags .
no other road was mentioned this year as often together with the words &quot; Left @-@ Autonom@@ ous Viol@@ ence . &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like body injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the off@@ ences make property damage , which tend to meet the new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ant house for 17 years in addition to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for violent acts , it is wei@@ ght@@ less : people in the 94 are their neighbours who have certainly not been . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the famous burning cars are no longer present in the Rig@@ a@@ er .
for the architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here you help one another , live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately moved into the Rig@@ a@@ er Strasse - and remains .
that is why it was also so important that the residents get their way back : from the police , the politics and the media , who suddenly took the Deut@@ sh@@ ek@@ ness over the district in July .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former construction gaps that supp@@ ress the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so well @-@ beg@@ ged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what do you want to do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the residents .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding of the drawn @-@ out people who are fond of color bom@@ b@@ ings : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who walks into a pub , can complain badly about noise there .
all the names presented only have been asked not to be called by their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the administration team around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine Customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the aff@@ lu@@ ent Woll@@ mil@@ k@@ sau , which has a problem above all .
for example , some - less spot@@ less than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , an aff@@ lu@@ ent Woll@@ mil@@ k@@ sau .
but administrative work is not their central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le believes .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people , and also behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent position for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
soon there are new containers in the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been acknowledged .
the local authorities are responsible for the supply of connections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must place the refugees in their own or rented living rooms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the District Office to the Commune and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every host wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto , the administration does not find any private apartments .
according to Deu@@ sch@@ le , it does not work so far .
therefore , community apartments must be in@@ timi@@ dated as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be installed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a firm stay , there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be fixed or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house master , do not @-@ for @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no occupational therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity doesn &apos;t just mean work .
the day requires a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers like sports , contact with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
administration and Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers also jump here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
they have to explain to the refugees that it takes just time and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses .
those who develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach can &apos;t work and are useless , he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
but there are also problems , says customer honestly , &quot; people with whom nothing is possible . &quot; therefore , the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : are they afraid of ra@@ dic@@ alization after the most recent events , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were afraid that the attacks would bring them completely in retri@@ eval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary officials have to look for activities locally and in the region .
in doing so , they are always in the background that a new shock of refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
politicians do not hesitate to answer this question clearly .
actually it is unfair to put them on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no new refugees , that would relax the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ g@@ bacher is already busy with a reasonable effort to integrate previous people .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar with helicopter sought
