<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the sport pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer with some colleagues was looking for a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted home at the fast gallop home.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And that was the end of the riding career.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer from all time - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself be led with his family about the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even go for photographic purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therewith also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">German sports aid handed the man out of Anhausen into the Golden Pyramid of the Sport as part of a small gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silberne laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the Year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the Queen of Britain has already adjoined him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th winner of the sports pyramid is long.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this award means a lot to me," Langer says, "" "" "" "" because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US master winner was admitted to the Hall of Fame of the German Sports on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="24">The awards include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, Turner Eberhard Giver, the founder of Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the pioneer Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handball Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part, the illustrious company went to the show stadium, where the Lavazza prize went.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trump economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump want." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are not one at the tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental principle.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction.</seg>
<seg id="5">On the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warn of how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he will massively drive back regulators and he is responsible for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfill, it has disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "therefore, taxes for the rich would be increased," "" "" "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we must invest in this," "" "" "" "says Trump and Clinton almost speechless." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly refused by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">In other words, even party-internal discussions could come to Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the differences in energy and climate policy are more significant." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the US again." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas; it wants to announce the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energy with its investment program and demands: "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazical trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the United States from international trade, but simply to better protect American jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid better then, for example, Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be up, he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion in the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the one hand, Trump who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics deem it that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants them to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistance doctors argue: demands for new work combat measures</seg>
<seg id="2">Representatives of the resident doctors have called upon their union to approve new work combat measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more work combat measures from the start of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC testified that ministers agreed to respond to the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, assistance doctors and medical students voted in favour of the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members who were posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government "persistently calm" would have remained a problem, which led to the refusal of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "In consideration of this, the JDC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and request official new negotiations for all your concerns." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Executive Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running program of escalating work combat measures that begin in early September.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disputes led to the fact that these resident doctors struck six times this year, the first total failure in the history of the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the BMA resident doctors Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms recommended by the BMA.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg's Palace, I can't defend myself from the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile appeared narrowly and he hardly radiated warmth, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" "" "" "" "dear friend" "" "" "" "Putin - according to a report a whole five times." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if there was never anything bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a sustainable boldness issued by Putin showed that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border with Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to fall back on Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even bigger, as it was made by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the veto becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious accusations of senior officials were that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after finishing last month in a failed coup d'etat of almost his office.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this week the government projected cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "a report in Vedemosti put it as follows:" "" "" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West as it looks at its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the ongoing resentment on the snail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian head of state secured a bonus for the fact that after the attempted coup d "état, he demanded support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present an "alliance of outsiders" as an analyst once described to me: two countries that violate themselves from the West and are badly treated and now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played a role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents met at the press conference that they hadn't even touched the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey abducted the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state would at least talk to each other again.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the board of directors of the Bank, the RBS brand is only to be reduced to a back office role.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was connected to the global ambitions of the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="5">Since then, the bank has distanced itself since it had to be almost collapsed and saved eight years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this period, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other end-consumer brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">She supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from the Six Nations Rugby up to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now she has decided to focus more on national brands.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales, all RSB references, decentralised headquarters and stock exchange listing to Natwest are changed.</seg>
<seg id="11">The brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other smaller brands for private client business that will be more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">During a sightseeing tour by customers and employees, McEwan was interviewed in Inverness-shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He shared the BBC Scotland with: "the brand RSB will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our staff will be busy, as we are now more to become a bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">When the Bank became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I now say that we do not pursue global goals, but local goals." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with our customers under these brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in its sports sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it's time for us to become a bank of brands, as how do we focus internally (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago, if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and had launched these trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can launch these stamps again, so I think the time has come.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">He placed a milestone on his local circuit with his second prize of the night at Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who reaches the milestone in the flat race.</seg>
<seg id="6">He succeeds Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.</seg>
<seg id="7">The three-time winner Dettori, who won in front of Ghayyar, said: "it is something special."</seg>
<seg id="8">I'm very emotional because my family is also here</seg>
<seg id="9">I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I've landed here 30 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I am relieved and very humble.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dettori picks up the cheer when he brings victory to dilemma</seg>
<seg id="13">Two jockeys reached the milestone in obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy who achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derbysieger had 4,493 career starters</seg>
<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jockey of Modernism and it's no surprise that he reached this milestone, which only a few have achieved before him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect, which differentiates him from the others in the weight control room.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin humidiots Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of the narrowest confidence circle of Putin for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a statement by the Kremlin, it is said that without stating reasons, Putin has ordered "the release of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration."</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been a substitute for Ivanovo since 2012, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website, it is said (in Russian) that he later became a clerk and deputy head of the governing body.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as a Head of State on the implementation of your instructions and controls.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and Vaino recommended his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow has mysteriously made this step.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidant and works as he was for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff withdrew on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was touted as a potential president, would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin being quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, I could almost say, to trust adorable items for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">He was previously Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, since a third term of office would have violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close ally Putin's ally, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was Prime Minister before being re-elected three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "" "" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "" "" "ceiling blowers" "" "" "", "approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 helical ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Minister of Economic Affairs, Keith Brown, visited the building site today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he said," "" "" "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queenson crossings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all the witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the Viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, almost 79% of the total deck decks are at their place and the last section of the deck today gets a pleasure for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructor, said: "the first closure represents a significant milestone for each bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project presents the closure of trendsetting high and low construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installing the last section of the road and its connection with the North tower, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the north side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, about 6,000 tons weighs and has to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate as the tolerances that the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="7">So far, there is a regulation missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "the SPD leader Christoph Bratmann believes:" "" "" "" "we agree with the Greens:" "" "" "" "those who want to build on urban areas must in future reject 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch the world changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and kids don't go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens has been lamented by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about bringing people away from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and last but not least on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the publication of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand declined in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was shifted due to the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon which can be tracked with a GPS once they have been found "photographed" (using a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the boat and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person puts back every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, informed the Washington Post recently that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of follow-up people who exercise 30 minutes each day, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns that people want to take "themselves 30 minutes" time to "get out of the sofa" and "to be active every day" stumbled on deaf ears because many public messages to health are dull and come from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who exercise regularly can reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderfull thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friendships during the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are also grumpy game-destroyers, who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could trace our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its attraction and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world and will help many people to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>

<seg id="4">Simone Biles is on all that immun.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Stunningly on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant on a whole line.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast sounded the championship title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winners and "Final Five" team comrador Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles urges on the Swedish bar during the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-combat title and the fifth, while she consolidates her call to be the best of her generation, or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts her in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought her sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou rescue on her said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected a final examination in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi-campaign of women at the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark at the farewell party of retired co-ordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during their long journey, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of her floor exercises - which contain her typical tumbling pass - is attuned to Latin American music that would fit in at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is not by chance.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a little child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans's mother during a school excursion into the gym, was trained in the Boorman, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has not lost a competition competition, a series of victories that will stop as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafina easily led through two turns, the picture was cloudy.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish bars and floor stars - in which Biles holds the world title - lurned.</seg>
<seg id="28">She resumed again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and sat on top with a 15,933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her softly as her endeavors were expecting - a pure formality - and tears streamed at Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was a vengeance for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafa in Tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time the 22-year-old team cap, called "Grandma" by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her ground exercise she threw the audience kisses, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-old has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl, who died in one of the deadliest cancers since a decade, were killed in the car and listened to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a hand-held firearm while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police announced that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the aggressor did not take the handbags or the $2,900 taking possession of one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to take a closer look at whether they were connected to four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven people were killed in hispanic homes within four months and two more were injured.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS at the beginning of the month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is assumed that the suspects used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators refused to reveal the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and that the same murderer was committed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report about the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the threefold murder and assumed that it was the work of serial killer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heavy rainfalls and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call on Friday to call out the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened with large-scale floods after extreme rainfalls, the National Weather Service reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards informed that state officials in constant contact with local authorities are already on the road to help the affected communities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, announced that requests for flood-water vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.</seg>

<seg id="7">A flood warning system is used over large parts in southern Louisiana to Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service announced that there could be an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In southern Alabama a flood warning system was used on Friday while it was raining in the Mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both of which are located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses into the suburbs near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that an current downward flooding in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these rivers are slowly flowing into Lake Maurepas via the beaten rivers.</seg>
<seg id="13">The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi River border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 09.00 on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams still plucked people out of flood water in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the south-west of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were rescued from Gloster on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, has a strong rise over night.</seg>

<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said that he and his family members had any disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that Nothelfer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were accommodated until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">Krautmann said that the flooding "spread rapidly," as there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13,75 inches of rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that due to the rainfalls, the soil has been substantially absorbed since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities said that heavy rain and road flooding caused the rescuing of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and Lessard Loss in five school districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS subsidiary in WWL reported that a subsidiary in Tangipahoa attacked 200 houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches that were now both flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">The leader of the municipality Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals rinsed by floods.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I present to me under the Women's Olympics in the Turns and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this team has three turners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewish girl and Madison Kocian, who is the Catholics, makes everybody proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a startling Olympic winner and America was cheering.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gyms routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual event for multiple events.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we do not see turn classes throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same path as Aly and Madison to join the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. also, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that Turns are an expensive sport and gymnasts in the first place in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who are responsible for training, training, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turntables are in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to provide a more affordable and easy-to-access gym training to the communities with countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, bringing thousands of young girls interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team gold and thank you for motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Resident doctors want to organise more strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hunts's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 assistance doctors who voted for election rejected him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the contract and said that the NHS was in a "No Man's Land" and would be detrimental to staff and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first resident doctors are to receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and week endars, in order to improve the care of the watch-times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Committee on Registers, announced last night in a communication with: "we are still seriously concerned about the proposed agreement, in particular that it will heat up the current maternity crisis and administers it to treat all the doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new treaty, progress has to be made and time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes caused by discussions have been tackled by the government for reluctance to participate and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had just done last month that his door would always be open.</seg>

<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a respite of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to physicians on the strike chain.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the Reformed Contract with the functionaries of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants a better weekday pay for the 54,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract.</seg>

<seg id="16">Over the past two months, we have spoken to the committee of assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns of guardianship and whistleblowings with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as despatch, flexibility in training, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training camps and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health were concerned with respect to the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="3">The coagulation drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="6">The NICE Regulatory Authority has recommended a four-year long-term intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that make plaque.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the layer breaks apart, it can cause blood clots that clogged up blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clots dissolve, it can flow through the blood stream and clog blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making blood clots more unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft of NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all individuals who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person's quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness Culture Addresses electoral fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year for the dismissal of a government report because of corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread ignoring widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, such as a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and city councillors for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of "hypersensitivity in ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an antinitarian king, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barriques outside of electoral cubicles in order to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he recommends that voters should show an identification card in order to prove their identity in elections." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">At present a voter only needs to name his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to apply non-removable ink to a person's finger if they give up their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistle-blowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">He claims that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it serves not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes with it," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's electoral campaign in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special electoral tribunal decided that the incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would silence his critics with racism and extremism accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him. "</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of imitation in which one person chooses somebody else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He expressed himself in particular alarming for the deceptive letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the leadership of ID cards to prove their identity.</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report, it says: "as proof that pressure was applied to vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of elders, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there were concerns that... State institutions have knowingly ignored such behaviour because of" politically correct "hypersensitivity concerning ethnicity and religion." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the ban that political activists process letters of letters in order to stop polling.</seg>
<seg id="23">The report envisaged by Theresa May also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on a person's finger as soon as it has given up its voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">To carry out systematic reviews of the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are optional.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic lettering.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition that political activists process complete letins and envelopes from mailboxes.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the authority to set up lockouts for electoral stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change of legislation facilitating an indictment for intimidation in accordance with the 1983 Representation of the People Act 1983.</seg>
<seg id="31">Prohibition of photography in electoral stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the polling stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that employees generally enforce that voters walk alone in the election cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric drops across the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlet's case there was no complaint.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the electoral tribunal has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices unfit," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked with Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or the back, this video will show you how to turn the spears for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">When approaching from behind you should turn around first so that you can see your aggressor and "go out of the shot," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Beat it then with the knee in the bar and twist while the attacker cures from pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat it with the barrel and move backwards while holding the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="8">For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and twist them so that the attacker can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time shift the weight to the weapon and beat the aggressor to the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before they move backwards and set the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi advances.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright sweeps his tongue to the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller entertained his immune system and the worms of a serious test by leaking up some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk pushed his course on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a draw toilet as well as a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before leaning every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment that was infiltrated under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to light.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to lick the rinsing button of a draw toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestines by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public stations to railway stations to jetting dumpling of toilets, the task posed its immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial balance showed a luminometric figure of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the luminometric number of fresh washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick after their luminometric rating amounted to over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "in the film he says:" "" "" "" "that comes close to the worst thing I have done in a toilet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I won't lick anything here because it is disgusting inside here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valio Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New Releases Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer the consumer something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "we performed crazy brainstorming that ended that we said" "" "" "" "Let's call Ian" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had to lick him like the disgusting Russian toilet which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick it and others where it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all interviewees reported lactic acid bacteria particularly with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that they use at least occasional products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social apartment after deloculation with a loss of £50,000 because they had terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skelby and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls showed gaping holes, wooden planks were torn up, rubbish was spread on the floor and graffiti was smeared onto the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the property management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment could no longer be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe people don't have to live in this way." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime, and the police said that the terror which the family had caused, street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screams, disputes and curses included.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for antisocial behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">Old trash has been found in some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate, where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floorboards were torn up</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing led her and her partner violently from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily move out.</seg>

<seg id="23">Now that they are finally gone, it will become beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Managers of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have agreed to co-operate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, 20 years long</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down.</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that the lessee agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family, as deloculation is always the last step into consideration of Cornwall Housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and provided us with information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give some comfort to some neighbours and the message conveyed that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="37">After they were homeless, Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>

<seg id="18">The World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer Games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic Games commenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, WADA Kenya took part in the list of countries whose Doping control was compliant with the rules of WADA.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is considered a large runner-nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">Athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of television reports of the ARD, allegations were repeatedly raised that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound requested a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had employed in Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">It has been proven that this kind of sport has been comprehensively examined and systematically mutated.</seg>
<seg id="26">As a result, Russia's athletes were excluded from the summer games.</seg>

<seg id="2">Weird Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia may not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">They understood them in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the Sunday election will not take place right at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For so far it is not stupid: summer holidays, heat and land election campaigns - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the locals, who are to be convinced by the polls, are on holiday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers travelling in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so you can't choose the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count voices at the end, only work hard.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and the last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has once again forced to pass electoral campaign close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, has to fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newbie AfD cuts off and what remains in the end coalitionable.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost invisible electoral campaign, one sees from his big posters." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes roses and talks a little with the people, just as his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, sea ering has got cold feet and chancellor Merkel to blame for the revival of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her refugee policy, her "We create it," accelerates the rise of the populists, which will probably cost him the fine office.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU, with its leading candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when one makes election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited chancellor Angela Merkel to major events; Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other federal states," Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently accused NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise the north-east CDU largely waives the usual election conditions at market places and from shopping centres with solar shields and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "that, according to Kokert, plays only a" subordinate role. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union has also noted that in the country you have to remove the base that it has to work very hard to find a wire to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are going to do it like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any present in the expanses of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The advice of the CDU election combatants Kokert to his comrades is also self-exposing: "they must go where it hurts, namely where the people are: Dorffest, Golden Weddings, any birthday party has to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys last week, the S & D Group lagged behind partners CDU (25) and just shortly before the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election 2011, the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the surveys, are likely to make the leap into the country day." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>

<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything will be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is also vowed by the absentee of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of lodging drives.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen was lifted and that the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the village has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now move from Ofterdingen to the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The passing traffic by the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were sometimes significant complaints," says Florian King, head of office for the refurbishment management of the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creators were looking for and more familiar with their Navi than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that many trucks in residential areas were franchising.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limits were not observed, the municipality also called for the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there were considerable transgressions," "" "" "" "says King, who himself made himself aware of the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been injected.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was at 77 km per hour in the Tempo-30-zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved forward, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that the road is open again for customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">Businessmen don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27 refurbishment has led to net sales, everyone can look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some are less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the "end customer" are produced for other companies, for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "Thomas Sulz also speaks of a" "" "" "" "most slight decline" "" "" "" "at Autohaus Maier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily trafficked supermarkets are along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crowned, finds distinct words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "not only him, but all the restaurants have" "" "" "" "hit hard" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>

<seg id="33">"" "" "" "the" "" "" "" "road renovation" "" "" "" "has dropped its operation" "" "" "" "for two years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "half of his staff he has to release." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President-President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where something more generously handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally, the family business has been settled here since 1715, pointing to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regular guests are now less frequently overlooked because of the complicated traffic guidance.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it's also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubts about the fact that his pedigree is back after the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, this is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="21">Refugees who are specifically picked up in the country should be able to check their smartphones and reveal social media accounts for a safety check.</seg>
<seg id="22">For asylum seekers who have been rejected for asylum, he wants to prove even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or subdue their papers to obscure their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "some of them are politically and legally unleashed." "" "</seg>
<seg id="24">Some things have an irregular effect and leaves unanswered questions.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the impatient treatment of patient for example - the question arises: what does it actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "yes, says de Maizière:" "" "" "" "it is important to differentiate between the topics refugees and terror." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the residents of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">Moreover, in view of the high number of refugees, many people worried about security.</seg>

<seg id="34">And yes, there are election campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the subject of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">Over the past few days, the two parties have gone up high.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a garrisky dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a security policy collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the chief managers also demand a Burka ban and a return from dual citizenship.</seg>

<seg id="21">In the course of retrofitting, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no degradation in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor output.</seg>
<seg id="23">After retrofitting, the car manufacturer wanted a "guaranteed" certificate, but I do not speak of a "guarantee," as was stated on Friday in company circles.</seg>

<seg id="32">With the wide term "warranty" Volkswagen can see the possibility that customers, for example, come into a workshop for example half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the interests of the customer, it is important to avoid that any other damage, which has nothing to do with the assuring scandal, may result in uncertainty with regard to possible warranty claims, as it was said.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore, I do not use the term "guarantee."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">This statement is derived from current data before commenting on the pseudonym of non-Allepurea men in the middle of men with harsh insults.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much-discussed recovery of sound plates is not attributable to a boom in millennials, which want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife-Nostalgie.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no horde by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you agree with the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and stuffed wildly before I stand, hold my hands and say something insinuating like: "so, let's take a closer look."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent vendors were located - still a handful of fantastic record specialty stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera off for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to appreciate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged women) into Reckless Records (number of people: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought I was probably too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray also believes that many customers he meets to apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media group, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to re-buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have conducted, people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to the WET, some of the older customers took off the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retire to the stability of trusted Record envelopes, from objects that recall happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "" "" "" "says WEZ." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is so with me as a collector so and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way of being mentally engaged.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are like their social workers" "" "" ""! "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month did not yet belong to them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't have record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried while browsing through a stack of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect."</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "someone came here recently and said," "" "" "" "I don't own record players, but I'd like to buy a radiohead record, so I can put them on the shelf," he says. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-intensive, less music class.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "we have people who say:" "" "" "" "I don't have record players." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the sound panels to almost an entire floor, has a colorful audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts newest synthesize and sexstrained pop rather than experimental jazz wears out of the speakers - is it good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks odd, but naïve psychological trauma is hard to imagine if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of the plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a window-shopping than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or other way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives away with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">As I give the impression of wearing jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter decide to buy a crossover.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a stairwell, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the sector and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as records.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research revealed that the results of YouGov attest, they do not take into account the large number of female collectors in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers, who exist in reality, record shops and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not to stroll through record stores of Berwick Street and the sheets through records, while they steer clear of the staring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator, who raises nothing of the middle-aged men over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities argued in Calais that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses in which people within the camp sell goods, cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid, which would have a risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also thought that the temporary businesses and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely trackable."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feed people who live in extremely precarious conditions. "</seg>

<seg id="1">UK recovers silver in 7-er Rugby after Fiji gets Masterclass Gold</seg>
<seg id="2">The impressive performance of the 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were hit with a result of 43-7 at the deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji has distributed a master class in handling, side steppe, back, lines and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was lost by the not too bad price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the strikes, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Briton will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This flap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started beautifully and had the attacks on GBs from fun to bounce off.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. on as if one would run into running busses. the World Series winners were rated 5-0 to Osea Kolinisau in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">After four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner that he turned.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A superb staple of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, in the seventh minute, Veremalua turned a touch down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new member since the second half and there was still more than a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vbreatho Ravouvou pressured by further weak tactics of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while still learning GB.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led fundamental changes to the half-time and completed the Fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua toured Tuisova after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt on GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game itself went for a long time in favor of the South Sea sultry, whose fans sang, flags wave and danced on the stands.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the finishing touch with another try in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the fijis hugged and GB tilted crushing in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed SA into a scarce semi-finals match from the race - Great Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fight with the trainer's cancer for a rudder victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more nautical gold than with these games and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard dogs that enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was omnipresent when she ruined the second Olympiagold without a tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sport, who placed such a benchmark.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolute, after all her 39th unfulfilled commitment, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletins gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the Triumphal Arch.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers that make up the difference and it was no one more instrumental than the trainer who did not know about 30 months before he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risked.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that's what they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty terrible situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit to the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, off the season, which kept the break up to a minimum, if under such circumstances the right concept is at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">That is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it one even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-rocking morning doing something more than anything else and trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. this is perhaps a bit extreme, but it means so much." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much I do, how much I and Helen and Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to get carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Glover must appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>

<seg id="3">"" "" "" "the association counts as" "" "" "" "exemplary" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">A small Frankish drinking water association as a model for the big water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This meant that some time ago in the original, it was part of the Bayerischer Rundfunk's contribution.</seg>
<seg id="6">A little later, the water forum of the government of Lower Franconia swore to the purpose association.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "the work of the" "" "" "" "Veitenstein Group" "" "" "" "is regarded as exemplary" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who worked for 31 years in the Zweckverband employee, 28 of them as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Veitenstein-based Veitenstein association, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, annually promotes approximately 150,000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The municipalities of Kirchlouder, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach are members of the congregations.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current president, Breitbrunner mayor of Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from the water line construction and maintenance work through office and organisational skills, budgetary planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency assignments at weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the purchase of a central computer control (2004) and the modernization of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There have been no downtimes and you have always added innovations because water is the most important food for life and drinking water.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He worked with a lot of lifeblood for his water-purpose association and he lived downright the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group for lowering nitrate in front of the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received very much recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Geller, for his part, praised water goalkeeper Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water man and he was a faithful boy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As highlights from his point of view he described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the purpose association.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were the tubular breakage at the high reservoir at Kirchlouder on January 3.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work all night at minus 17 degrees, so that the towns could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">One once could only maintain the supply of new brunn, because one filled the elevated crater of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - a view of the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-shaken and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in the millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the sector threatened with green power support are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains with the release of the Renewable Energy Sources at the existing plants for so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West German Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only once the generators are replaced in the steel mills, an EEG levy of 20 percent falls.</seg>
<seg id="10">But this, too, is not elevated in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this way, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the successful endeavour of Gabriel for the steel industry is particularly important." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in view of our campaign" steel "" "" "" "," this is a first step. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "also in the reform of emissions trading, climate and employment targets are to be weighed," "" "" "" "declared IG Metall-CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and a considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to aggravate when the world's largest producer of products made massive steel on the world market in the face of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers are throwing prices dumping Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring the situation somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel show impact, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have brightened.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainably the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp now also did not want to exclude the closures of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, the German steel producers are cautious despite rising prices and growing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">They produced by 3.4 million tons of less crude steel than in the previous year, as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the amount produced was going back to the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has fallen by two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">Thanks to an improved order situation, the association expects an increase in output in the coming months.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she took the subject of music in the school choir, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing inspires me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors just from several perspectives, Erhard Hackler says from the German Senior Championships.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in chorus and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describing Hacklers.</seg>
<seg id="8">Regular cooperation allows seniors to socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures are dissolving in old age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be tiring in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">Seniors are training deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs get out of the puff, even in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at age, singing is an ideal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz, of the Federal Labour Association of senior citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, singing together had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, it explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakes many memories, often connected with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, self-dementia sufferers devise long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a special power is required for the head, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focusing on one's voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone are doing so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir too.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are good reasons to start singing, so there's enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when there's a sound next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the search for the right offer, senior citizens have different options," "" "" "" "says Hackler." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings of the circle of acquaintances in a senior-choir, one can easily join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the internet may ask the family, friends or neighbours to help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hacklers.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="2">Biologists have studied in Hanover what effect the kiln of kittens has on adult animals.</seg>
<seg id="3">To their surprise, the misterns didn't allow the males to be cold - however, they always kept the same in contrast to the females.</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can recognize the degree of arousal of kittens at the mistrust of the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="5">They respond by ten percent faster on lauts of kittens, who are in great need, as scientists have figured out by the Veterinary University and the Medical School Hannover (MHH).</seg>

<seg id="8">She is the author of the study published on Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">In a previous study, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens shrieks are different with the urgency of their neediness.</seg>

<seg id="11">They were played for a blast of little ones, taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated by mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of stronger aroused kittens, who were additionally lifted up.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bomb threat in Thailand - Austrians wounded - Several dead</seg>
<seg id="2">The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">She had suffered from cuts and had been treated in hospital, but I was able to leave it again.</seg>
<seg id="4">Her homebound trip was planned for the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, be unclear for now.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is constantly in contact with local authorities, such as waste.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin exploded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Nightlife.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Friday morning, two explosives went up again and another person was killed according to the authorities." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the detonation near the popular seaside resort Patong, a taxi driver was injured according to police instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country another bomb exploded, killing a city clerk.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosives had gone into the air in a flower beet in front of the Revier of the coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-western coast, as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast, demanded several injuries.</seg>
<seg id="15">One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," said Army general Danai Kritpolavee, Friday morning to journalists.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we assume that it is a coordinated attack." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to express himself on possible motives - but probably it is about the acts of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the attacks, Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks did not arise in connection with the Islamist uprising or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is only local sabotage confined to limited areas and provinces," "" "" "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">The authorities have received secret information on imminent attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however, they have not been informed of the exact date and location.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police reported their officials all over the country to enhance security around major government buildings, airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings again, but mostly they are not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thailands king Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the next bombings, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommended its homepage to follow instructions from the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After disputes between security forces and Muslim populations, trips to these provinces are discouraged from unnecessary journeys.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elaborated by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This also grants the military a great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to cause chaos, while the country moves towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military junta, who had seized the power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, reinstalises itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not managed to get a grip on the rifling rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack of the recent history of the country.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympic Games or World Records are not always able to determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Center the slightly overweight float from Ethiopia was so slow that it could no longer be seen in the TV pictures.</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte was then promoted to the viral internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished his race with a return of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>

<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming more popular in underrepresented countries.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic meter waste water will take place from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welschahl in 3.44 instead of previously 2.10 euros; for allowtenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 Euro (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (previously 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the facility in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate measures for improvement are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After an oversleeved calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the household by the council Office Kulmbach, it was found that undercovers were used for these sewage systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to the legal basis, the market of Kasendorf is obliged to operate the equipment cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, the citizens and the industrial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The increase in fees is between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt displayed the panel, a new calculation of fees for the wastewater treatment plants of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, overlapping or undercover from the previous calculation period can also be equated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained that in all three wastewater facilities there are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water waste, which lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters a year.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result of the low distribution base, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the volume of waste water in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the past period of calculation, all three plants were not least due to their age of refurbishment and repair spending in a considerable extent.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the wastewater treatment system Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pump factory Welthahl, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled and at the pond wastewater treatment in Lopp, the first sewage sludge had to be removed, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation system had to be installed to comply with the water regulations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "Schmidt:" "" "" "" "these extraordinary expenses came from the continued assistance and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which are still considerably below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "" "" "snapchat" Anime "" "" "" "" Effect as Asian caricature criticized "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be made of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are immaculate, self-propelled tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All malmissions will go to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the past, Snapchat filters have attracted criticism in which they were accused that the app Blackface would promote or promote white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week suggested a filter to some users, who gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow-spotted."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchatted shared that it would have disabled this feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended to pay homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but outsiders who have experienced racism" "" "" "" "reminded the filter of hurtful clichés." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely used across the photos, wrote that the filter was "hurtful and said to be unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face has been moved to the exiting extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling block." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are more diverser than their older counterparts - could expect to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters a picture that is insulting for a user, "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case before," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who worked as Product Manager and Engineering for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that rapid controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the setting practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu, for the great part, criticized white, only male leadership and ended up with a hashtag: # Deleteam chat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they do not have diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinesich-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his associates, but according to a speaker, the company recently recruited a staff responsible to focus on underrepresented population groups and internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu also said that she will leave her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence, establishes committee of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence to draw up a more optimistic view of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site, reported an investigation committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Republican Task Force, reports of great discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information typically attracted by high-ranking Centcom Commanders reported a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence suggesting that government tips have given directions under Obama to change reports, it shows how analysts looked at the pressure from their superiors, a more optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than it corresponds to the facts." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom member announced publicly that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, continues to remain under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "after months of investigations, so much is clear." "" "" "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command's leaders changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans launched the Task Force after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information as the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the Centcom Reports are underway with the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the news service committee on Thursday released their own findings, which coincided with some of the Republican Task Force's conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited trial for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest-level democrat in the Committee, Member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this process, Mr Schiff, delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "" "" "Damaged the morality among analysts and" "" "" "" "there was little room for deviating opinions." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats gave no evidence of a White House intervention in the Centcom analysts in regard to a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "preliminary results of the investigation were published on Tuesday by" "" "" "" "The Daily Beast" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's general Inspector, who was accepted after complaints from Centcom Analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon's spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the reports of the Congress, while the investigations of the general inspector were still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "but he also stated that" "" "" "" "experts at times have diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense greet a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defense." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">The accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of the military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State, reminiscent of more than ten years ago, as a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush foresaw only a small occupying force in Iraq and little time pretending to be concerned about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in revolt against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, according to government agencies, the team led by Mr. Hooker dictated that contrary to the statements of the government airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State, they had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these makeshift refineries were put into service to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after she had shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockeyeteam of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games were supposed to represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in the memory.</seg>

<seg id="10">However the game might go out on Saturday, the American women have triggered a surprising vertebrae through their success story, four years after they landed in the past London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>

<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>

<seg id="20">India had entered the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed themselves surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and knocked the ball in the gate for the American female to get a 2-0 lead.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the age of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "the events in Rio de Janeiro" "" "" "" "Rio de Janeiro" "" "" "" "feel stable and inescapable, a fast relay between competition and aspiration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the olympic torch itself was a burning rod, which is passed by the crossbow to a swimmer to the gymnast for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffeshop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Leopay or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's swarm with dimples, could have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the olympic gymnastics tournament.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports which are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make modest arguments for my particular favourite, then let me draw attention to the discrete charme of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it became so sparse the last 16 years that many of those, I had questioned, did not know that it is at all an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jump and until 2012 had had an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for their wives.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it is suitable for the unenlightened ear suitable for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but an enthusiastic enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonful trembling of his never-ending bulging - but also the graciousness of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially combines.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "the word" "" "" "" "Trampoline" "" "" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Up-and-coming victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot at almost 30 feet in the air and must have a number of falling movements (turning, hacking and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to their performance, degree of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to move forward in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and back, upwards and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">Not only do they hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also a further high goal in television transmission: that of the world or the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator into tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel tiresome when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing spell.</seg>
<seg id="31">The trampoline vector is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; that of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the end-hours as part of a fortnight block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympic Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear-monkey and the objectivity of male athletes - as the male U.S. Turner recently proposed - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his air-rinding, new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police in gunshots.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia to break it together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, protests erupted against the government and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organizations, the government's response was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security officers beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a thorough investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is cherished by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism beyond the region, especially in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced, and dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the expanses of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you're oppressing people and they don't have any other options except protesting, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time tensions continue along the Eritrea border; a fight for this fragile, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Ogao Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front (Ogaden), who in recent years have been more or less forced to use turmoil and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of biting after years of before bending under the surface are now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years have very many Ethiopians been able to communicate with the social media, since cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians enacted that they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian countries, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are going to co-ordinate under a screen," "" "" "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of the Ampera and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amperas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is being dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, accounting for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the third reason for the turmoil is the death of Meles Zenawi." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death on an unpublicized illness.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts are saying that he was particularly versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special officers to process enemies and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the current regime is lacking in this basic skill," "" "" "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively intransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after protesting thousands of elections which, according to analysts, apparently splashed from the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in the last months and that time of unrest passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Developing experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal misuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an amharan city, attacked by Tigray managed businesses and the hatred towards the Tigray becomes more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts are saying that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for emergency flights over the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it has closed that base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While Westerners clearly want to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares Obama's claim that ISIS was founded "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were not meant seriously by the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raises new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings about his fellow combatants who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful period, in the particular position to explain statements he might not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After making an announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump challenged the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret, the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the Conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump tried to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate wished to know nothing about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism stumbles upon Mr. Trump as he tried to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation due to falling demand values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found his speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already advanced sarcasm in his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he raised strong criticism when he thought the Russians were to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained "Of course I said that sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic borders in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then possibly" clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once pushed over the price from the market, Cafe in Greenpoint comes back</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a bigoted café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue store were supplanted.</seg>
<seg id="4">Soap Cherie's store, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Native Americans claimed it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabale wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel exempted, and verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is change, then it is also new invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb Cafe last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time staff of the old cafés, the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide money for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes like capers and acidic onion.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café does not serve beer any more, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "many old customers were also pushed out by awards from Williamsburg," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a client.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the path.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb had been closed, she gave up coffee drinking for a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I realised that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb I liked," "" "" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a Blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the club in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before work and invariably ordered the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I came fourth, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything bagel with butter," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Today Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything-Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he had no resentment about the fact that the soap business had taken the old business space.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for tasting with the coffee brewed in the coffee shop as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think we will still go on their offer," "" "" "" "said Rodriguez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional Polish inhabitants Greenpoints have also accepted the café.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new client translated the menu to Polish and Rodriguez said that he proposed to leave them soon so that his new neighbors will feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The site also has other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice restaurant would like to fill and sell the cold-brewed coffee into the bottles.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance that the café expands to an adjacent building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers, a new verb goes out to get their old favourites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was felt like a homecoming.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I had to smell the smell," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a delicacy President Roosevelt had a faible for hatching delicacies of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland waterturtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on that day was somewhat more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as a dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "her husband Andrew Coe added," "" "" "" "It was also a message to Americans how to eat." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while brick was told in her book "97 Orchard" about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal" which will be published by Harper Verlag on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they met a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, local snack at Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey ate with mashed potatoes and vegetable blend.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter booked Hackgrill, this found the couple suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food was very popular," said Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanut bread, liver loaf and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap which stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it has to be placed in the stomach like lead," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-in-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cook for male ricoons and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "a Square Meal" draws the paths with which the country was converting, not to be the Cockaigne.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it was a time when food for the Americans became a central theme," "" "" "" "Coe said why he and his wife wanted to write about it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget was equally tense: mysterious meals such as breads and casserole were staple food, the Kasserolle was considered a "wonderful way to recycle food leftovers," Brickman noticed, as chefs were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the centre of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange blends have been tried out because a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even wholesome food.</seg>
<seg id="27">While researching the book, which also includes recipes, Brickman prepared a dish of this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it was not a popular additive at lunch," "" "" "" "says Coe." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelman continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions are not matched to each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the laundry recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before, or since then, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - have such an approach to eating habits in the country.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household policemen," and the challenge to transform pamphlets such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a Square Meal" "" "" "" "is a celebration of historical delicacies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">Especially tasty are the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-Me-Cake-eating stance.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen, he spoke like the million-million man of the world he had become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental dishes like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and carried a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was marvellously realistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had asked him to make an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, Mrs. Roosevelt, a housekeeper with no interest in flavors, caused the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most controversial. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country was back on its legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is based on our continuing focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as how science was applied to foods.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple stated in writing the book the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law better understood - for example how they could not throw food away.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "she had a real fear of the waste of food," "" "" "" "said Coe." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="47">There was the windfall.</seg>

<seg id="49">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is called Prune Whip," "" "" "" "said Ziegelman, and added that it was a common ploy to miss a chic name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">There was no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Each one dipped somewhat reluctantly a spoon in the tanned, brown glibber.</seg>
<seg id="52">Amazingly, it was not bad.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenlanhai: the oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland haie usually only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland hairs only get up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in one hour it gets on average just 1,220 meters far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a full 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle characterized by slowness, however, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any case from a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland would become stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland hairs are hard to observe, after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures of about six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the way of life in Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow-motion-pentaphs measured them when they buried six animals with one transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, these sharks make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Perhaps they chase sleeping animals or patrol the bottom of the ice-sea and look for cadavers, that torches out of higher water-layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland haie, which caught fishermen from Greenland or Svalbard from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest of them measured 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is already born before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had eye-catching much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear tests carried out large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimetres, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland hairs, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens nucleus, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 cm long Greenland shark, while the record shark with 502 centimetres is even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">The researchers were now able to associate an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age at 156 years was determined, Greenland haie with the increase obviously allow for at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is not by chance that such Methusalies live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, whose bacon at the neck stuck a 120-year-old harpoon head, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often become particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal gets warm.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest more resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="7">In a stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false speeches and retracers in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax statements.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations although they are not obligated by law.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have given a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.</seg>

<seg id="19">President Obama also supports the proposal.</seg>

<seg id="24">Clinton's tax return from 2015 showed that they purchased just USD 100 of their income as wages, unlike most Americans.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their major investment was a cost-effective index fund from which the Clintons dividends and earnings of USD 109,000 were taxed.</seg>

<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah," made his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>

<seg id="2">The altar-strants from the soul care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way for a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were met.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all the mini-strants in two years, the Oberministrant lap St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a several-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations have been examined and one finally decided to visit the bishop's city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage goal was offered to Freiburg Cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruene, Haigerloch and Heiligenkreuz were on their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Pastor Canct sent the pilgrims in a small ceremony in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrims and informed the pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb to the starting point Villingen, where also a Muenster Unserer is a wife and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual tours were framed in the morning and evening, depending on a short pulse with different prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even on the way, the Minis at field crosses, chapels or churches always took a rest to sing together a song from a specially produced parishionist song booklet.</seg>
<seg id="11">The dormitories of the local parishes were available for overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage destinations, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and tonic dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we passed Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next step was to take the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but had to fall down about 500 metres altitude at the Ringier heat and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the evening the deserved reward was a common barbecue at the swimming pond.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning pulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived at the Freiburg cathedral in the later afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a small impulse God was thanked here.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Minis of Kooperator Markus Obert, who arrived at the pilgrimage destination, were welcomed at the evening mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner spent the last evening in the men's team sprint in Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made to Eigen. the Jutes made the legend haughty when he stormed home to win a victory from New Zealand's favorites.</seg>
<seg id="4">Four years ago England claimed a shocking victory, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the World Championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hinder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement generated a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton attempted to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the bulkhead that is now unfolding.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny, who won four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner set an Olympic champion in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindes fell short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, in which Hindes went to a higher gear to slow it down and make it Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he intentionally dropped on the track after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">In such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "Hindes said:" "" "" "" "it feels with all the UK flags on the platform like London." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>

<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny it's in the realm of possibility that he repeated Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger bannister were born) - a hive of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the finish in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record that won gold in London 2012 was 3: 51.659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday, he had been arguing with representatives before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and completed tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archive of Milngavie will be in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a bunch of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played in the background, so the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director, in April, in the midst of sexism and mobbing, as well as the retirement of magnitudes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, when you look at the first evening of the competition in Velodrome, it looks like the legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the moment, can be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the system operator announces the energy supply contract and will lift up all supply contracts, as the energy company delivers.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision at Victoria beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the facility.</seg>
<seg id="4">The subsidy, which is set for 20 years, will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are up to 2,000 workstations in the Alcoa plant in Portland.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects as the enamel consumes around 10 percent of the entire power generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa concluded the Point Henry smelting, which led last year to a closure of the Anglesea power plant.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Alcoa distillery in Portland loses money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, where Chinese companies CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melt-melt," the company announced.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL also said that the contracts were called "hedging transactions," which should have entered into effect from November 2016.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the view of this cover made me cry," "" "" "" "wrote Kendall." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply keeping Up with the Kardashians), a weird reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular Showbiz-Uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), which ends with a classic twist: they all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the stereophaicked act almost every birthday episode of a children's programme (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon girl on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, surely a new era of the Kardashians has begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim may have struck what the vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were looking forward to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold-out edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles a picture band rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine filtered out before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "in recent years there were clearly more" celebrities who model "" "" "" "" models, celebrities "" "" "" "" on the cover. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar Award winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even at the low chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities aren't related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if it's all about Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, released on the last cover, was one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners does not like success to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV history, Jennifer's position in the world of fashion has always been tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-Modell Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised and called them "the mistents of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings came up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But to travel around on the displeasure seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer by Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">They and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells pictures from Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her spare time she is seen in Reality TV. probably only to see her sister Kourtney and their children.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 160,000 of the country's emergency services are rejected annually by the community centres, while the industry is preparing for the effects of further mid-cuts on already overloaded transactions.</seg>

<seg id="10">As of June 2017, the Federal Government will cut the funding by 30 percent, which means that thousands of needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.</seg>
<seg id="11">We call on the Federal Prosecutor and Federal Judge of Justice as well as Senators from Queensland George Brandis to immediately suspend these funds, so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.</seg>

<seg id="2">New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after announcing that her campaign manager for North Carolina put a firearm on a staff while traveling in a jeep in February.</seg>
<seg id="3">The incident is described in an indictment, which was submitted on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), considerable losses for the governing parties of the SPD and the CDU are notable.</seg>
<seg id="3">This resulted in representative surveys conducted by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition could continue to rule in the north, this is not possible according to the survey figures in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">But in both federal states the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to face the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD collapsed from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party only smiled shortly before the CDU, which could come again to 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is fought between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would be 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite light losses, the Greens hesitated at 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent) into the Schweriner Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="11">NPD and FDP were not represented in the Landtag with 3 per cent respectively.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the survey, the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) according to the survey was only 23 percent (2011: 28.3 percent).</seg>
<seg id="13">The CDU reached 23.4 percent only by 18 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are still smiling behind the Greens at 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but in front of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="15">The AfD would be represented at 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Deputies.</seg>
<seg id="16">With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, the pirates would, in contrast to 2011, miss the entrance.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nokia 9000 communicator: the first smartphone</seg>
<seg id="2">E-mail and internet in slow motion: the Nokia Communicator was launched 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The unit weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was rather clumsy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be sufficient today for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" arrived exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, in the shops - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few Euros, fans can still buy the equipment on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">But 20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone maker announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as an "office in the West pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new cell phone was able to receive a lot for those standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator has to be reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even accessing websites was possible by using HTML browsers, even if tormenting slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we found a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody could have guessed that Communicator would become the beginning of the smart phone era in August 1996.</seg>
<seg id="21">Everything has changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Finns' mobile phone business experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually sold to Microsoft and handled.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, the market is dominated by suppliers, all of whom came later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Being online always and everywhere, this is everyday for a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users around the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">About 1.4 billion units were sold, and Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million units.</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide sales of the equipment is around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">This includes the well-running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">A whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="31">The crucial breakthrough to the mass market came first in early 2007, at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone on Mac-World.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an internet communicator, everything by touch screen easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="33">Apple's triumphal march, still today, the iPhone is the company's most important product.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry dominantly dominated the market.</seg>
<seg id="35">They finally disappeared, blackberry has to fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">The sax now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention.</seg>
<seg id="38">Today, every German today looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we all need to learn to get the smartphone away even once," "" "" "" "said Janina Kugel, the Siemens Board of Human Resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="40">In the meantime, permanent availability is regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>

<seg id="2">For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to bypass advertising blockages are the same as a "cat and mouse game."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockings on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post where it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding with regard to its adverts, to make it difficult to identify which part of the page advertising is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this type of hate-and-Her battle between the time-provoking open source community and the bans has already been underway since the invention of ad lockers," and that Facebook is soon to come with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has embarked on the struggle is a strong indication of how worrying indicators for the industry have become worrying.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to a study published last year by Pagefair and Adobe, worldwide use about 200 million people display blockers; nearly four times as much 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">With 1.03 billion daily users who access their mobile devices on Facebook, mobile advertising generates 84 percent of the advertising revenue of Facebook.</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police are calling witnesses, after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed a presumed suicide of several vehicles on a motorway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman lay in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that at the age of 49 a Swiss woman, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several drivers have already been heard, but some have not yet been identified, the police told them to call them and every witness of the incident to report themselves.</seg>
<seg id="9">An investigative process was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, shared Gilles Hofstetter with Le Tribune de Geneve.</seg>
<seg id="10">It remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a clash avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "this is something the prosecutor has to decide," "" "" "" "said Hofstetter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - in which a person was running in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that the drivers didn't have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year, a police officer was acquitted of the negligent murder, after crossing and killing a man who was lying on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious in the street, and accepted the court.</seg>
<seg id="17">The court found that the policewoman who responded to an emergency call came into a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "totally extraordinary and unforeseeable situation," the judge said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably habitable according to the projections of a new NASA air model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies from NASA developed a model to explore the past of Venus with tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could once have rebuffed Earth-like conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably rejected more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and protected from quicker evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS Model Simulationist the slow rotation of Venus exposes its daylight side of the sun for almost two months," stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than those of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus, similar to evolution previously thought by planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably habitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their steam was burned away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide has remained with a deadly greenhouse effect - the Venus, which as we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the constellation of the Pleiades</seg>
<seg id="2">The latest mission with Kepler's Space Telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the Pleiades cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates, and in which context the rotation-time periods are associated with the planet creation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star enhaces, we can learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star-pile of the Pleiades is 445 light-years distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotation rates, these mature stars poke large amounts of starches.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star is ageing, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by identifying the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The newest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars are turning slower than solid stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compared the stars with dancers, with bigger stars rotating more slowly pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the star-pile of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities like rotation rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the star-pile of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is still much ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and so to speak hang up their "dancing shoes."</seg>
<seg id="18">Rebull and her colleagues reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.</seg>

<seg id="2">The tears ran faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball-star in the best days from Base to Base.</seg>
<seg id="3">After his emotional withdrawal, the 41-year-old pro will be wearing the Tricot of his New York Yankees on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I love this game and this team."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I'm saying goodbye to Goodbye," declared the 14-time all-star game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).</seg>
<seg id="6">Three times Rodriguez was elected the most valuable player in the league, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.</seg>
<seg id="7">His signature under a ten-year contract gave him $27 million a year since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="8">Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with a full salary.</seg>
<seg id="9">As a player, Rodriguez paid for a long time with performance.</seg>
<seg id="10">With 696 Homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 he abolished some milestones.</seg>
<seg id="11">With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players in the most important statistics show similar values.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the 41-year-old still shouldn't be recorded in the baseball hall of the Baseballs.</seg>
<seg id="13">Because so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was in the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.</seg>
<seg id="14">Already in 2009, the superstar admitted to "ESPN," banned from steroids between 2001 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="15">In August 2013, due to a development in the so-called Biogenesis scandal, it was closed for 211 games by the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rodriguez is considered to be the prime suspect for having received high-performance funding over an anti-aging clinic in South Florida for years.</seg>
<seg id="17">After a lawsuit, the lock was reduced to 162 meetings.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the League could have done a favour for me for 2014, because I played 20 years without a break," "" "" "", "Rodriguez said in a sweetheart at that time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Also his farewell days are not silent.</seg>
<seg id="20">While many baseball legends have survived the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.</seg>

<seg id="2">Caught: due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland in Rio is not allowed to start.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">A wiped athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition, the first official doping cases have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle course runner Silvia Danecowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the already critically acclaimed athletics competitions, these messages come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was already shown last Sunday, which is used as masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sports Court CAS confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old occupied fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterfly, just 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have been invited to take part in the 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B-trial and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations," quoted Xinhua from a message: "we will cooperate with the International Sports Tribunal for ACT and will accept the judgment."</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history it is no longer the IOC, but the CAS for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news about the positive rehearsal at Danecowa by, the 33-year-old went into the offensive.</seg>

<seg id="18">Danecowa has been suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-rehearsal will also have a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately contacted the athlete with criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't understand why athletes don't pull the right conclusions," "" "" "" "he said," "" "" "" "Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the athletes start, especially the case of Danecowa is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF World Association banned the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic doping the start, also the runner-up nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide blackout hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of contact malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in this process.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware-defense specialist Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, some times victim of an attack using blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the goal of ransomware extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the required ransom to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize their blackmail software to attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially resulting ransom will be significantly higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a startling rapid evolution of malware," says Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the malfunctions were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place quickly in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware actively works for a simple pattern: once on a victim's computer, it searches specifically for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or Database files as well as for archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail press.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin -.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users find the personal photo database on the game, companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases without stopping production.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage is higher if a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent had even had to cancel business operations completely, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we always say to the victims," "" "" "" "does not pay, you only promote the problem," "" "" "" "explained Kleczynski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker again know that and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackheads and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt for free sample files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to return their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively riskless gains from the ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus company SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The so-called malware Kits were created by purchasing malware, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers then search for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums on the underground, buys the set from a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "usually the criminals then commission spammers with spreading," "" "" "" "explains Wisniewski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, the risk of ransomware is known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey rely on repelling ransomware by file back-ups and scanning software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful measurement, the perpetrators will instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing" "" "" "", "says Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators will also be able to take completely new targets on the internet of things on the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a connected thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating might well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the rear seats of the rear bench can be folded up like seats and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor up to ceiling.</seg>

<seg id="21">The remote-light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller responds to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity, however, is only for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and an HDMI jack are under the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped Top Diesel are fine.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is regularly stowed on the bypass road - here a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this is to change: the legal balance needs to be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all drivers who are driving in traffic on the environmental street every evening in traffic jams when they drive over the highway to Zubringer (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">On the coming Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August), road construction will be extended by 700 meters in the area between the Hammer Street and the Weseler Straße exit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then thread directly from the hammer street to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The major advantage: traffic is sharing early on, thus improving the overall workflow on the busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The road narrowing on the feeder annoys drivers above all between 17 and 19 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">Weekdays from the back-stau to the bridge over the Albersloher way and sometimes beyond.</seg>

<seg id="16">However, it has to be reckoned with years: because the bridge has an official rest period until 2034.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one passes eternally, at night, one lies awake for hours, in the morning it is no longer to think of sleep far before the wake-up ring.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of the adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeks, member of the board of the German Association for Sleep Medicine and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands for the time being, however, is the insomnia, i.e. a sleeping and sleeping disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many people feel unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of directors of the German Home Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "very early awakening is particularly common in depression," "" "" "" "says Wealth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated disc can lie badly, wake every two to three hours and begin to greet problems and worries about everyday problems and worries.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I sleep with a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are compromised during the day should go to the doctor, advises them.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: you are beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate the sleep problem, it is important to find out the causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medicines - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dr. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Research Center at the Charité University Medicine Berlin, will hardly be present in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleep problems, one should first turn to the doctor at home, advises them on the advice.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">In order to investigate the sleep laboratory, doctors advise doctors, for example, in snoring with breathing difficulties, in case of sickness, sleepiness, sleepwalkers, or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "just ask no nap," "" "" "" "says Fietze." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After covering, one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes in the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a probe at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">There is also a camera on the ceiling of the sleeping person.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of screws where you can sit for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is not too long to sleep in bed, don't watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and don't look at the watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that's not conducive to it.</seg>

<seg id="3">On Thursday, the police thugs of the Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men between 50 and 61 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several handkerchiefs and baggage theft piles.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30 p.m., civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf airport recognised a gang that was known to policemen from past theft crimes.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several offences this year since the middle of July.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the detective commissary 34 can demonstrate four actions to the thieves who had been recruited to commit criminal offences to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">They carried a total of more than 15.000 Euro.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lime tree ponds, and a rest of cobblestone streets in between: the Rigaer Strasse in Berlin-Friedrichshain is not at first sight, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Walking along the road from east to west you pass playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a bike shop.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "someone" "" "" "" "ugly" "" "" "" "has sprayed onto the façade of a grey house." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">In contrast to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already being built: a house with high windows and 133 new apartments should be built here by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy neighborhood" as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, however, is preferred over the past few weeks with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, now the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel had spoken several times for a hard action by the police against the project, the area designated as a "no-go-zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On June 22 the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, patrolling the police three weeks of official assertions with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers went down under the cheering of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of houses in the sun, others talk about late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who mainly trains three children, are mainly generously protected by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern of increasing rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who wishes mostly police protection against vandaliating left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin senator and the police make up between home occupants and their neighbors, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain, east of Berlin, was actually a traditional working-class neighborhood, which in comparison to the rest of the city has a low average and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, many houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire main street in the vicinity of the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and electors from all over the world. residents of East Germany and former occupants now share their neighbourhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them at dismounted windows or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year as often together with the words "Left-Autonomous Violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes like body injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offences make property damage, which tend to meet the newbuildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenant house for 17 years in addition to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "as for violent acts, it is weightless: people in the 94 are their neighbours who have certainly not been." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer present in the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here you help one another, live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately moved into the Rigaer Strasse - and remains.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was also so important that the residents get their way back: from the police, the politics and the media, who suddenly took the Deutshekness over the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through faceless newbuildings in former construction gaps that suppress the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "indeed, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so well-begged," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what do you want to do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding of the drawn-out people who are fond of color bombings: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who draws, should be aware of it - just like someone who walks into a pub, can complain badly about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All the names presented only have been asked not to be called by their proper name.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the administration team around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the affluent Wollmilksau, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, some - less spotless than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, connected with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, an affluent Wollmilksau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, Annika Deuschle believes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people, and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent position for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it was high time," "" "" "" "says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the supply of connections.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you must place the refugees in their own or rented living rooms." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the District Office to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every host wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find any private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to Deuschle, it does not work so far.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, community apartments must be intimidated as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be installed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a firm stay, there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be fixed or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house master, do not-for-profit work - and that motivates and very neat as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "this is" "" "" "" "no occupational therapy" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity doesn't just mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day requires a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers like sports, contact with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">Administration and Volunteers also jump here.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to the refugees that it takes just time and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach can't work and are useless, he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are also problems, says customer honestly, "people with whom nothing is possible." therefore, the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "" "" "all this is already a" "" "" "" "mammoth task." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: are they afraid of radicalization after the most recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "no," "" "" "" "says Regine customer quite clearly," "" "" "" "some may call naive." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they were afraid that the attacks would bring them completely in retrieval." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "" "" "says Regine customer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary officials have to look for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">In doing so, they are always in the background that a new shock of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">Politicians do not hesitate to answer this question clearly.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Urbach we have not arrived where we want to go," "" "" "" "says Annika Deuschle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "no new refugees, that would relax the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urgbacher is already busy with a reasonable effort to integrate previous people.</seg>
