Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it should also be the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing sett@@ ling of Israel and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal with Obama , the relationship between the two continues to deterior@@ ate .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ can in front of the US Congress , which was partly considered an affair against Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the election imminent election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was it important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
within the house the officials found the bodies of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was stuck on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to undo it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who was in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular skill professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ mark Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has made the fatal emergency call sometime afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after shooting at the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb was motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself was mentioned in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses from both .
at the same time , there were some inclin@@ ations on problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb praised , said he seemed too excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Delta State University had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the promotion , for which the Lamb had worked hard for him , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ ination &apos;s conception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are questions that the Lamb cannot answer any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trail when he went back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parent &apos;s house at the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said she knew that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy .
he did a doc@@ torate in the spring of pedago@@ gy .
one of the long @-@ time girl@@ friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through shared friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar play .
he was at the time of the women &apos;s s@@ warm .
all girls melted away when he was there , &quot; H@@ air@@ ston said now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said she had been divor@@ ced 15 years ago but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared both on a summer festival three years ago .
later they played the one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for different companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a B@@ ark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5 September last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmony .
there was no evidence that anything was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were in the clearing and sh@@ ew@@ ed together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of joke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening , about 900 people participated in the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commemor@@ ative ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ guard , while the Univers@@ it@@ ch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police told him that Lamb made the call after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss called his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox he@@ ats over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simul@@ ated gin and an arrow length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back for the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had premiere 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever filmed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back in Time &quot; will be visible to VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN CEO says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says , &quot; There is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN leader calls again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Secretary of Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to meet the crisis in Syria , Ban requested the same solidarity and unity that they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Change values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to draw Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks among surveys , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no one says that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp stamina and begin to let down their dollars to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values that suggest that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
tru@@ mps have turned 180 degrees around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 per cent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tru@@ mp would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 per cent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next thing about enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 per cent of the republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the Favor@@ it of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans do not see tru@@ mp temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six of 10 independent people say that his temper@@ ament does not pas@@ se into the White House , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their money , republi@@ can voters hold tru@@ mp for real .
if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change since the time four of ten end of July set their money to J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at that time in the last cycle four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P voters will look at the Tru@@ mp campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp beats almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tru@@ mp leadership while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp is re@@ aping the majority support .
he has points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Paul , John Ka@@ eck and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a vast majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their opinion .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tru@@ mp say they have set their votes firmly .
of course , a lot of things can happen to change that , and no one can really say that they will never change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tru@@ mp .
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on the subject of immigration .
since Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign two months ago , immigrants from Mexico called &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; was the immigration and fishing point in the public discourse to 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will hold crucial His@@ pan@@ o Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp in questions of immigration .
as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tru@@ mp seems to do so .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs up to new high levels .
at Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of republi@@ can voters , mainly due to their out@@ sider status .
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; pol@@ lu@@ te . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg you can find the most expensive residential community with a view over the North Sea .
in the street a square meter of a roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers a square meter is most expensive .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , one of the price rises as pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros ni@@ x - per square meter , well marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not an exception here .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double Tor@@ schüt@@ ze in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller made the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her score in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol hits ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth start success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola wants to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich at last .
Müller received at his 28 hits in the Champions League to the Bavarian leadership of good help from Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had a f@@ lange @-@ thought shot of the World Champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria captain Philipp Lah@@ m had promised hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his youngest six home games in the royal class , including famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went courage@@ ously with their offensive efforts , but often too imagin@@ able to work .
the attacks were often initiated by playing on left @-@ right Douglas Costa , who rarely came through against the former Braunschweig O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k struck out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ eck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half one .
first , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the pole of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct arrest , the Tor@@ wart Roberto par@@ ted with the knee ( 3@@ 5th ) .
even though the Bavaria asc@@ ended her usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could put needle @-@ stit@@ ches .
but Manuel Neu@@ er was a discount .
for example , when he took a shot of Ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te steering ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that made it good .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was initially sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero has only given green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Sam@@ mer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is already vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Go@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still put one on it .
before the game it came to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a small group of partly ver@@ m@@ um@@ ed Bavaria fans in their audience @-@ bloc obviously provoked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went with banners against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that puts a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study close .
the good news : in the absence of ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk decreases quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this goes out of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to qu@@ itting smoking , smokers lay the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fa@@ che higher .
the scientists had seen more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth loss are cavi@@ ties and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore go back to frequent gin@@ gi@@ g@@ ums in smokers .
not clari@@ fied whether smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ing again sin@@ ks to the level of qu@@ itting smoking , Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich explained from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must convince people of being non @-@ smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; head of study H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and also leads to good dental health up to high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years are affected by lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared with .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study investig@@ ates the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet at Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on rem@@ nants of late ancient origin
for the repeated time at the right Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne archaeological finds have been made .
in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum Skel@@ ette and remains of historical buildings excav@@ ated , Museum Manager Marcus Trier said on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
at all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always considered a specialist office for archaeological excav@@ ation .
in the third construction phase of the Rhine @-@ bou@@ lev@@ ards , archae@@ ologists have now found five .
from text documents it was already known that in the fourth century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained Trier .
beside the rest of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with some 350 graves which probably belonged to the church .
young woman from freight train captured
after a young woman is buried at the train station in the violin @-@ wander@@ ing lin@@ ders , the Federal Police asks the population for help .
on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 a.m. , the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the railway station and was captured by a freight train that came from the direction of Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach .
due to the acquisition of the train , it has borne severely injured injuries according to the Federal Police .
she was treated with emergency medical care and brought home to a hospital .
on the basis of the noc@@ tur@@ nal crossing of the young woman there is no evidence of the ear@@ nest officials .
the incident was possibly observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
there are residents or pass@@ ers from Lin@@ der@@ ner Railway , Bri@@ ck@@ ery Way , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .

EU Commission propos@@ ing new court in dispute over TTIP
to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private closure facilities for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which is significantly more traditional in its functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the responsible EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström at the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swedish has introduced the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TTIP aims to develop the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings suggest that the EU states and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the USA and third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time a second instance is planned .
it would allow it to rise against judgments .
until now , the parties involved themselves on arbitr@@ ators , a claim against their jud@@ gements did not exist .
in the discussion of the past few months , it became clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström .
in the long term , they want to work on an international investment tribunal according to their own data .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could also be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) are considered to be one of the main reasons for the big resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critici@@ zed by opponents as a sort of parall@@ el@@ ism , which can enforce damages to tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act accepted the proposals of the European Commission as insufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to Canada ( C@@ eta ) for the already negotiated free trade agreement .
the German Economic Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as great progress .
the Commission took part in the reform key points , the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Business Association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Business Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned against restric@@ ting the economy by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could thus be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when discussions on the TTIP free trade agreement TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year .
this date is considered to be no longer durable .
delicate Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
11 years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
the whole audience , about 40 persons , is nearly taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells the story of different places he always draws on the map , which reports his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they were created and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has become a wonderful creative Ir@@ rer .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; published clever@@ ly composed songs , which are harmonious very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can be dri@@ fted at any time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a we@@ ary series : each of the 50 US states should be in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but already in 2004 and in Rhein@@ sberg , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive expectations .

a year later , the musician returns to the series in New York .

the album goes into the American Bill@@ board Charts and is missing in no annual list of influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then operated on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic reference pieces .
this sixth record studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .
since the smaller clubs have long gone , the stage shows are made here for the colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .

even though nearly 2000 guests sit in their chairs , the stun@@ ned St@@ ev@@ ens turned back to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the broad@@ ened album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister Fra@@ gest@@ unde
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unde is expected with tension
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will be able to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unde and put himself to David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to place the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs from nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , because it comes after his appointment to become a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them on Tuesday during the commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has provoked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands at the centre of several titles @-@ stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; respect@@ ful of silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Shadow kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; from his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be stack@@ ed within Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour should make changes to remove all the idea of a limit altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory leader over the last decade , over the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised another politi@@ cian , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
Is@@ lington North MP said that the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ ctions will be confronted with opposition , and that he will refrain from both &quot; perc@@ ei@@ ving &quot; and stri@@ pping with with@@ ers , and instead of concentrating on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n stated that Angela Eagle , the shadow of the economic minister , will be represented if he does not take part - for example , when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the sub@@ house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron told him that he would be able to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ le @-@ Theater , &quot; which is often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ ming .
since it was first broadcast on TV in 1990 , Fra@@ gest@@ unde was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the sub@@ house and its position under his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require extensive reforms .

pound increased by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound was spr@@ inging up like data which indicate an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller building target .
between May and July , earnings without Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest in 2009 and brought assessments over the time of an increase in interest .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index has an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures propose all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - is reporting growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core increased by 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion dollars by a stock sales as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the Packaging and Paper Group Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , and with a decrease by 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment for the company rating .
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.@@ 1 % , having reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger expansion .
the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ gil@@ l says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees &quot; could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power would compensate for the higher labour costs in his company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs could make the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to potato ön@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both - and in the potato d@@ ön@@ er , who developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger Imb@@ iss@@ ant Han@@ i Al@@ hay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen in television .
since then there is a barbecue grill which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of Lebanon has now been registered at the patent office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility model .
as much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

met@@ cash starts ground level campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
Met@@ Cash tries to protect I@@ GA branches in front of an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground@@ breaking campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing about social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in I@@ GA stores and store shop@@ keepers who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will release further details of its defence strategy on 29 September , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy .
it is a lot on the game since South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern states .
however , analysts such as Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and met@@ cash 250 million $ until the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in food and food business and amounts to Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost Met@@ cash about 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will fall in food and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported that Met@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
i@@ G@@ AS market share has declined by 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Retail , which is about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operating debt reduction at equal pressure on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to improve sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week and I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh foods and to deliver a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading rehabilitation programmes at El@@ an are expected and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 for the first time in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and deserves praise for his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight by the not@@ orious confrontation between Kyr@@ gy@@ z and St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbitr@@ ator , with Har@@ rison said : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp@@ f broke a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I am pretty rich is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn up a little in the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat when he lost a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around himself , and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is trained hard , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own services .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take into account the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term solid component into the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick has made it very fast for Ascension , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the ramp , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the state of emergency and fought the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to stop illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted ser@@ bian officials with indignation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter flo@@ ated over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were taken back from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would return , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc with a strict meeting in Brussels could not agree to joint immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the shr@@ unk of Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent on Tuesday .
but Hungary did not put his hopes on a bal@@ ming action from Brussels or his neighbors .
the emergency held on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having ended a fence at the Serbian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison races were used in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East as a major bott@@ len@@ eck and the entry point to the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , among them Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws which came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected to be expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said authorities 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come out by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences of crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are able to quickly repair the fence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and squee@@ zed a crowd to push themselves there .
some 20 succeeded , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is gaining ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is chann@@ elled for the presi@@ dency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections .
more than five months before the start of the election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates will support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders achieved some profits .
Clinton holds a great lead in women and vegetables , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support in men has declined significantly , and S@@ anders back here only with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under 50 years has fled , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
Clinton still has a big advantage among the older voters .
last month Clinton was before S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election nationwide say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some reservations and further 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are stronger mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - just about one quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
while 48 percent of the presidential elections say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can voters say this about their top channel data Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question , why they want it to be the candidate is the most common answer that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with the problems and the vot@@ ability are also cited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the vice @-@ president raises a potential for the presidential office , 57 per cent of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election would see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked for the election who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
from Clin@@ tons followers more than half that Bi@@ den would be far ahead of their second choice .
if Bi@@ den decides to channel not for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s head increases before S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this number of 78 per cent in the last month dropped .
Bi@@ den has risen by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , with the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the vot@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
similar to the last month , there is no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this election as unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics in voters of the elections of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
bi@@ ds best cut the lead with the three candidates , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic voters in the elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server continued as an external minister during the term , most of the Democratic voters of the elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions altogether .
but it is a different story in the American public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion was even worse .
it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views are worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy of the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the voting rights they do not hold for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the voting rights have seen Tru@@ mp as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , receive good notes in leadership .
the six tested candidates cut Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best in hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 demo@@ cra@@ cies in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves near Donald Tru@@ mp with a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey behind Donald Tru@@ mp
on the two candidates , half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically
republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers nationwide . support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month to 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son sur@@ passes well in demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tru@@ mp under republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ isa , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ te Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is at the deepest , and 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are on the third place .
the error margin at the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son increases in the poll@@ s - he ends up with 19 % support in the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp clearly before Car@@ son .
at a glance at a Car@@ son rising up in the last week , Tru@@ mp found some side si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question tru@@ mp faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean Sea is sufficient to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares .
bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east there is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is 25 degrees in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student died during a deportation ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder complaints were submitted to five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 brutal and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police .
officials said that he was charged with connected eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field on a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g became im@@ potent and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , his symptoms to goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , members of the Brotherhood began to hide and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning to his injuries .
after a Aut@@ op@@ si@@ e@@ Report , Den@@ g was repeated repeatedly with mu@@ te force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families have been destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the ship since 1970 each year , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be drawn to account , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of sham@@ eful attacks and education of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that has been officially or in@@ officially - this is necessary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest
a interest rate comes , and the house is getting into being , ren@@ ders for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into a recession .
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy is only a small guide to the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank stressed that investors should not concentrate on when they begin to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end of the year , market participants could find that the whole fuss might be exagger@@ ated because of a interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at low levels to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that seem to fear many .
this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the delivery of interest rate increases may make things volatile for a while .
as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets rose from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study to what happens after interest rates of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is usually in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , chief plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the stocks tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return on return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in a interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants have taken the whole year to an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week that ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could approve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all growth cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and placed pre @-@ rec@@ essions very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months .
the fixed income was also volatile as the market takes a interest rate , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in bonds , the Ren@@ di@@ tes seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle is carried out .
at the end of the awakening cycle , the bond yields immediately fall , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in the interest rates will lead to a closer cooperation between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending has expanded and the volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed has intensified its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that handle the larger part of their business operations in the United States will benefit if interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt are becoming worse since a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure stock markets , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts are in different opinion how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ver@@ du@@ mm@@ ung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between commercial ri@@ vals .
he also cited the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament @-@ Col@@ lins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ lins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took the &quot; Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts &quot; to Classic FM , claiming a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that does not do the private sender .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ver@@ du@@ mme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also cited the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be the Br@@ its just under another name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Director dismissed the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that really is uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 to find new music and put new works on behalf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to work to engage the audience when it did this in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the choice of culture , media and sports under fire to enter commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; in particular BBC mode . &quot;
he added , he wants the company to find a hit out of our in @-@ house barn , &quot; if it &apos;s the next time an entertainment series star@@ ed .
however , he refused to exclude the order from other ranks of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the record in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed the expenditure
for over a decade , virtual shopping has been dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say that there are indications that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales editor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he declared that online sales increased three years ago as buyers started to make purchases with their mobile purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now it oscill@@ ates , and we will possibly experience that growth decreases .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for downstream sales .
experts believe that buyers keep their purchases from this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers gathered around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the purch@@ as@@ ers fought for bar@@ gains , buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that of £ 5 was issued a bit more than 1 £ online .
with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of men buy clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident Get@@ ö@@ killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is s@@ ank@@ ed
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first burial moun@@ ts in Mec@@ ca by the streets .
Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse of some of the huge Saudi bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ sch@@ ee .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the route to clo@@ the her respect , when the first of the dead came to the Al @-@ Mo@@ Renaissance cemetery .
the funeral procession passed over to the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane passed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king over the construction company of the Bin Laden because of the catastrophe , which left 3@@ 94 injured a san@@ ction .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 people killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city will continue .
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group would not have been allowed to stand the arm of the crane , when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership was forbidden abroad .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which crashed into a courtyard of the Great mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place in this month , gathered themselves together .
the Bin Laden Group has no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal decree also took the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been involved in Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was born in the 1990 @-@ s from the family .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is necessary at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim .
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the members of the people who were killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other wounded receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q boss says that the time of cheap East European arti@@ sans is over
British employ increasingly craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen behind
this means that 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that aim at tra@@ des@@ people will be opened
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q sales offices nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Brit@@ ons put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out their work in their homes
if you can handle a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
because British increasingly employ arti@@ sans to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , thus the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices is now out@@ dated .
for this reason , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales points from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions are hit by women .
at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households than in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this stronger towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions about buying articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also changed her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and the turnover after the group retired the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trends King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball court A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and assignment .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also indic@@ ted for office abuse .
from this accus@@ ation , he was acqu@@ itted legally in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigation that the defend@@ ants were allowed to disp@@ ose of club accounts in 2006 to 2011 , on which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes .
the damage caused it to roughly 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports function@@ aries are also indic@@ ted for financial years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fact divided the chair of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the accus@@ ation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence was that the association had not occurred at any time an asset .
the sports function@@ aries have only compensated for damage and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , from debt - the Passi@@ va entered into the year 2001 about 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4,000 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then we stood in front of the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have sent money to put our life insurance as security at the Bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the confis@@ cation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , no debt must be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , in the case of a corresponding financial - success , the withdrawal of the damage compensation has been re@@ acted retro@@ actively until 1991 .
for this reason , one part of the postpon@@ ement damages only years later , namely from 2003 , was paid off as a plus on the account .
therefore , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes .
the accounts and savers administr@@ ated the two defend@@ ants together , said the second accused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the withdraw@@ als have not been disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association is not interested in the details of financial support , so it was important to have the freedom of debt so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account in 2011 .
these were set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants declared .
this securities account ran to the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
then he said finally , he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary was justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims of claim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why claim attorney ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never been a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all of the tailor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the function@@ ary said he never got a c@@ ents salary , he merely counts mil@@ eage money and diets .
in Di@@ eting he charged EUR 1,000 per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants were unable to show accurate documentation for the early years .
these are according to an audit , in which everything was judged correctly , did not have been kept .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
in his statement , he explained in his statement by his place of residence from the international market to the bank of Blei@@ burg .
the main trial will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard st@@ aves additional 30,000 jobs
in addition to the development of personnel mining for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will be able to build more jobs at the company &apos;s spl@@ itting .
the positions in the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ esen H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) find no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
this will reduce costs amoun@@ ting to EUR 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , shared the company on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the mining of 5@@ 5.000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed approximately 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share accounted for 2.3 percent .
the group of printers from the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto currently spl@@ its up : this is how the computer and print business will be bund@@ led into a new society - separated from the most promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
another dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand of corporate customers according to his services , set the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to the end of the year .
in the third quarter of the quarter of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
this was the result of the proceeds in 15 of 16 quarters .
HP responds to the change in the industry with a spl@@ itting and massive pro@@ positions .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has recently re@@ acted that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and always do more business online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans have a total of around 5@@ 5.000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct participation of German soldiers on combat operations in Iraq , however , would mainly result in rejection : 54 percent said , on the other hand , 35 per cent showed themselves .
the fact that other States are flying air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , are 61 percent positive .
on the other hand , 24 percent are to intervene in conflict .
a collaboration with the Syrian government of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad amounted to 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be for this purpose .
29 percent could not decide .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : demo@@ lition of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police were employed at the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tear gas and water lights against several hundred displaced refugees .
the correspon@@ dent correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has experienced the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police , a police line had formed and behind the police stood a water @-@ light .
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially set pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now declined slightly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had breath@@ ed the tear gas .
other refugees gathered together and suffered from breathing .
the press crew of the Serbian police also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; time of decision on interest rates for US bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world is watching when the US bank accounts for two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest will be raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will continue to wait a little longer and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will be stopped .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest was on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and starts a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ ć , Chief Executive Officer at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is based on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and only generate a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ aring outlook on global relations .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs suggest that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 20.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death shake at Delta State University left exc@@ uses
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted to make it happen , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social scientific education at Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shot on someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that the police had to send polic@@ emen to his home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but it will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to undo it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening , when polic@@ emen killed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ ination &apos;s conception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said that she was married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but stayed friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Pr@@ enti@@ ss was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he calls relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police arrested him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb was awarded a doc@@ torate in the spring of 2015 , as his life of life on the university &apos;s website .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa plans a large group conversion .
a half billion euros per year will save the Lufthansa Group alone with a better organization .
150 of the world &apos;s around 1000 executives will cost the workplace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the pilot union , there are new negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lufthansa builds up its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheap Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution margin of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , shared the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will not be responsible for the passenger business in the future .
the budget airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the board of directors of Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new presentation , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airline operates under the umbrella of the airline airline group , which represents three quarters of annual sales of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the court @-@ driven strike on this Thursday .
this shared the union .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wanted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a forecast result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between union and airline led to various strikes over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; background is next to the transition supply of the pilots &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right wing during the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left external def@@ ender to cry and exclude it for at least six months from the game , Louis van Ga@@ al is not hoping that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was burned into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before it was brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had a oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be able to escape a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a T@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ ws account said : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I &apos;m getting stronger again . &quot;
here : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
the England Defender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very serious injury . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the World Cup in 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that there is a very serious injury , it is not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad here . I &apos;m sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ play by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it seems always a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the story of the book , instead of giving an index of the movie version of 2012 , added the new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win a real tree , &quot; he reads .
as if it would not be suspi@@ cious : the text presented by Cameron is partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the walled city Th@@ y @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he is admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is the action of the book so little familiar . here hears an un@@ named boy , like the local environment through the c@@ ash@@ mere , trees fal@@ tering , Th@@ ought stri@@ cken Once @-@ ler , despite the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ vering , schn@@ ur@@ r@@ b@@ är@@ y being , &quot; which is called &quot; in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times a child each other .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come from Camer@@ oon &apos;s electoral office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ oon &apos;s staff , but there were no further comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still hard
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the Ka@@ der that England has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a downward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks Page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the joint spirit is strong ; they will not carry s@@ cars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as Sp@@ in @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
this news @-@ related message : Adam Ly@@ th divor@@ ces from the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that crime players are geared towards results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said that - players are their own best selection .
a long time ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully gets further purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not make good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and out@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that could be raised was that England first introduced Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in the highest form - but this lost chance now lies in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer I set up highly .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he achieved 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must receive at least the same chances as before him , but this depends naturally on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to suggest mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra @-@ spin @-@ bowl and receive four squ@@ ads , di@@ pped up , and I don &apos;t have anything against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this link has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined Open@@ er in 2001 .
he took three hundred us immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited use he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made a few smart additions to the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece .
he is one of the n@@ ett@@ est cores of the game that will bring a wealth of experience , as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in tune with the previously predicted .
Coll@@ i &apos;s team@@ mates at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be used at the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team manufacturers do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions will not be made easy .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit Britain from the EU ) could gain access when the economy up to 2017 in a f@@ lau@@ ght unit
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ completed new negotiation strategy to keep the UK in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C that viol@@ ently dis@@ sol@@ ves Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend said recently that some member states , as deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always out of their own fault , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disturbing changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of itself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend who wishes to look outside the UK inside the EU @-@ Zel@@ tes - &quot; L@@ ass not only with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as with the exagger@@ ated long endurance like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also an end @-@ to @-@ end force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they will pull up a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British to prevent their energy from going from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may not intentionally plan helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , while the Great Britain Spe@@ aker campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new trial was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ lei@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of the re@@ trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they were not in 1975 by Tony Ben@@ n &apos;s inspired referendum in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opport@@ uni@@ sts who have made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s .
with all his dec@@ eption , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
for this purpose , the Med@@ ley belonged to tax @-@ fear@@ ing ch@@ ur@@ ks , telephone chi@@ pping foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ in@@ lands that most of our big newspapers have .
actually , Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar to her , but realized that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one gets better ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of getting to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself when he was opposed to Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had rejected the principle of the un@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that opened a backdoor .
the press has never left him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he had no time to forgive me - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s years , a mistake back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe - I think it &apos;s friendly - in development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps are traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff Ten@@ dency and the wild battles of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can everyone say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in Radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ s when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet , without going too far and to lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; stay &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow stri@@ kers and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the stru@@ del of social media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks this way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for the EU membership - in accordance with their Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ungs @-@ Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the Nar@@ z@@ is@@ sm of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is sure that J@@ C will not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British if this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government on power , which was reminded by the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 persons , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the capacity of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; on which P@@ he justified his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the present best estimate is that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision @-@ making ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the 12 participants agreed to receive funds from an E @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for selecting the board members will not be delivered , but these include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which include a sector finance in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco management of P@@ he participated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , no such connections or limitations are discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; there have been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that the alle@@ gations of BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted beforehand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the unique duty to inform the public about what the proof proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people die annually on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion euros per year .
through the clear demonstration of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ calendar , says former boss of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK radio stations .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and tran@@ smit@@ ters like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC general director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he tried to contact BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs were commissioned or sent , which were clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson the Upper House Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to keep the broadcasting fee , what I consider medi@@ - or long @-@ term not for a good idea , you should at least put his production on programs that do not do or put them on behalf .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve a wide support for their future .
the idea that no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ calendar is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to see how this should be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s fault on the hunt for reviews was &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts will return what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how to sell East@@ on .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions for justification of 4 billion £ radio fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ tru@@ sive programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they lay them in a time window where no one wanted to see them ever .
Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here .
of course , think everyone , we all think that one receives a great value for 150 £ per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot , ask me if that is true because they do not consume much from the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their Rei@@ thi@@ an mission . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and they should take a look at the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a handful of television are shown , and with the commercial channels alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by frac@@ tures of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they have sound effects that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultras@@ onic waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , which can be used by ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an inv@@ asi@@ tic procedure that releases electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves appear on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells that are assigned to them , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels carry .
when he uses ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred into the worms where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that has to be revealed on an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered tissue and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily attack the associated human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added .

V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence , which dominated the advertising for the arms trade fair - and thought : &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ eli@@ ke company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have made a fantastic job by helping us shar@@ pen awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty .
what we need now is to enter the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not illeg@@ ally tra@@ ded outside our door@@ step .

eight golden rules for life in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old I moved into a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have been angry - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student resi@@ dences ranges from slightly annoying to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ ew : people tell where you come from where you get to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &apos;re saying &quot; honestly , Mar@@ mite does not love nor hate because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people that you like in contrast to those you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let &apos;s leave people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks recipes , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and move their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not remember to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
their room should be a refuge , but many student dwell@@ ers form a space @-@ to @-@ room b@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go further , but you must go away so that I will return the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS rather than kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos anchor : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
since you start the university at the peak of back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I bake you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to talk and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep dor@@ man@@ t if you anchor .
ste@@ aling foods is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the ho@@ of of chickens is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check that with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say they themselves serve themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your things , it is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate who added their milk a pur@@ ge to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise , which keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glass house .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbours if it makes them something , Drum &amp; Bass somewhat qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an exam in the morning .
she re@@ acted with even more loud music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she closed her own music , closed her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
vice versa , it would not be very embarrass@@ ing if you keep a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , to separate them again and see them every day and perhaps experience how they move all together friends to themselves ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to speak a little reason to your sub@@ lim@@ b .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good thing is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give you a valuable and am@@ using lesson through security - but never forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys into a glass of water , which you will then put into the freezer - but use your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
holiday homes for refugees , single educ@@ ators , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ nis@@ m
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds in Central Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental Rei@@ h@@ ouses for people who do not have a lot of money .
for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the only educ@@ ating Mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ nis@@ er . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show how to build a cheap and well @-@ done today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : it builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gymnas@@ tics has no sustainability .
for people stay in a large part here .
in view of the refugee flow , we need enough space in the coming decades .
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a holiday house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if one puts the people into living blocks .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it may be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace , I go back .
then the houses can be converted easily according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without property .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I made my project correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially complicated , it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the pitch regulation .
gr@@ assy .
it will still be under@@ lined who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is no place for this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced project ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what definitely is not true .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competition for affordable apartments ?
Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but they were built in luxury apartments that can hardly afford more .
my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the only educ@@ ating mother or the poor .
I &apos;ll show you how to build a cheap and well @-@ priced today .
that is why it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
the new operating system can be requested by going to the adjustment app , select &quot; General &quot; and then &quot; software update . &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then to install .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they receive an error message that tells the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to do when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it once the process is finished .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may turn off half way and could lead to a breakdown of the updates .

you should also make sure that you have seen our chec@@ kl@@ ist of all things before your download , in order to prevent things wrong and to protect themselves if they do . iOS 9 brings new functions , including a much smar@@ ter personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad , as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; was founded three months ago , and has recorded another member in his ranks , so the number of members increased to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who held more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to cure .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the Federal Administr@@ ative Cross 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation supporting Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot bring the membership fee .
youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wants the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; as an expression of his connection with the spa town .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain to the city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square .
a new district office was recently opened .
here , right next to the shopping market , you will receive sen@@ iors and advice information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of health and nursing homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for years we have established our out@@ patient care service that often nur@@ turing relatives are left alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are endless number of questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new household in Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is responsible for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; department of care and for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , you can use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or a physio@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .

witnesses seek the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were walking distance from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , followed according to the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
on the premises of the gas station , there were also three persons .
one of these men now scre@@ amed up the young people and struck this with the fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al @-@ leg@@ ged and bleeding strong out of the nose .
when his two friends were ha@@ unted and appe@@ aled to the bat , he initially dismissed from his sacrifice .
from his friends the injured young man was brought home .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their home and drove demonstrations several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle anymore , the injured was before the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked by the bat and another male person .
under the aid of a stroke , one checks on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be brought to hospital for medical care .

Dr. Frank Müller acqu@@ ires practice Fel@@ enh@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lowship .
in addition , Sam@@ t@@ Community may@@ meister Bernd Bor@@ mann , Business Development in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places on the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : Dr. Frank Müller acqu@@ ires the practice Fel@@ lowship on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ enh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich stands at half a point in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested € 3@@ 10@@ 000 in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at the first glance , when the Fel@@ lowship had learned to meet Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who currently completed their medical education in the hospital and also wants to enter into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the litter would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ enh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I simply called it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller pleased the idea to operate in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clos@@ eness and constant contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon .
and so one agreed that the garbage cans bought the house with practice .
however , they will continue to live in frac@@ ture Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ fold family @-@ father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a leading emergency doctor in the circle of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the DR@@ K readiness frac@@ ture @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ est@@ ausen , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the land@@ lords , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle themselves as household doctors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and endurance EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
furthermore , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a supplement of a total of 50@@ 000 Euros will receive a donation from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that practice continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ t@@ Community mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , approximately 2000 patients are coming into practice Fel@@ enh@@ ausen , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
there is another house practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ enh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if there was no successor , it would have gone .
those who visit Müll@@ ers speaking lesson also continue to look at their faces above all in familiar faces : over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors have practiced for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly will feel her after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are staying in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the dormit@@ ory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that everyone who wants a asylum application can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people are in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia
the Croatian government had previously reported that Slovenia would continue to travel to Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Minister of Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , did not look like this in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as an external border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Prime Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to shut down its borders for refugees but not abri@@ dged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced that the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to pass in eastern Croatian at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police attacked them in the near corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik constantly meet police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with around 4000 refugees , Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo were transferred to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , in the direction of Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was to propose certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the morning , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were the whole night out of the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border from Serbia on the way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has made it , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
thus it could actually come to a somewhat further west track for observers already predicted by observers of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had pointed out that his country for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees prepared appropriate plans for possible exclusion situations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not mention details , but pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you perform strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since been a good witness to the country since the standard of border controls .
on Serbian side , around 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian Gren@@ zz@@ au@@ n .
according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the remaining refugees want to go on to the Croatian border is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic still tried to calm on Wedn@@ es@@ days at a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he stops the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be a very high refugee rate .
one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still not yet cleared min@@ e@@ fields after the end of the Croatian border .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ e@@ aters was sent to the border region .
stock H@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is supposed to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals which is accused of having gained insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
insi@@ der information should be made by insi@@ der transactions on the financial markets .
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were added to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the processes against 32 other defend@@ ants were di@@ gest@@ ed in the case .
most of the defend@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid Mannheim has been established for 20 years
around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz there is a lot of operation .
people carry out their concerns , partly fast pac@@ ing , partly comfortable walking .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life in glorious autumn sunshine and in the middle of four large panels each with the heading &quot; Before I die I &apos;d like to die .... &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce helped with this action on their 20 @-@ year anniversary and is quite faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we have walked in the midst of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leader of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is also available to the pass@@ ers as well as questions and talks as the volunteer staff .
while man@@ ch interven@@ ed spontaneously to chal@@ k and set the sentence around &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; read &quot; the war , &quot; or &quot; not long &quot; suffer , others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again on the ver@@ ge of small discussions about the action on itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is just on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize the end of this world , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian plant Mannheim , which together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband bearer of ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore this public effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
the fact that not everyone wants to publicly inform themselves on the boards is understandable , but finally it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still subject to tab@@ oos , as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ z@@ ine movement in recent years have contributed much to the fact that people can open themselves .
an assessment that shares An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid .
the death and funeral service belongs to the volunteer staff of the first hour .
confronted with personal experience with the topic , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was sought by the appeal of volunteers , she immediately reported and was at the beginning of 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in Hos@@ pi@@ z Saint Vincent .
they are all trained carefully .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another war@@ ts , stop it for precious and value the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations allows training as well as training and supervision of the dying and ob@@ itu@@ aries .
every two years training for new employees will be offered .
the tables described on Saturday are now exhibited at the home of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
further personal wishes can also be recorded on postcards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook reduced for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the final quarter , and the supply giant sen@@ sed his profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its bo@@ d@@ transport service .
the company also said she plans to hire about 5@@ 5.000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a win between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the fiscal year , which ends in the next May , 20 c@@ ents less than the previous forecast .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes in spite of the price increases , which are average 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and in spite of higher increases for bo@@ ilers of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November .
the company said that the result was expected to increase the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online stock .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company brings solid income , considering the weaker economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
plans for holiday employment have been announced a day later than the rival U@@ PS , who plans to set 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5.000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the first quarter , the F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million , earned on 31 August , earned 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research analysts .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .
six of Z@@ acks sur@@ vey@@ ed analysts expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex reported a decline in international priority shipments , which brought sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter turnover increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result was decreased because of higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they included 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most expected session in the year Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time for almost a decade to raise the body .
threatening above them at an end of the finished , two @-@ storey sitting room is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set up the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the central bank has a two @-@ time mandate from Congress : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maxim@@ ising U.S. employment and prices are stable here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive by the short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets will make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which will contam@@ inate the financial market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists reported recently by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a interest rate this week .
however , the financial markets expect to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which indicates only a 30 % chance on an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts dimin@@ ish the impact by promise that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average j@@ umped 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go far too far to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
even before a month the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the discomfort of liber@@ als , it would be necessary to increase the proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
although inflation continued under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered together at the end of the last month , after China had exploited its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average was worth more than 16 % under its peak , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would cho@@ ke global growth .
the market has recovered slightly in this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now around 10 % below the H@@ och of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when one should increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would put on the breeders in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US bank .
now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the grip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the health of the world economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision making process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere hint of the former body Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could close its monetary expansion , dissolved confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected that they are not only monitoring the developments in other places , but also with other central banks and experts to get better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of re@@ perc@@ ussions on financial market movements linked with apparently not associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
var@@ n@@ ishing , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is committed to a interest rate , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its Lei@@ tz@@ ins by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited recogn@@ is@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ er .
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis like the market collapse of 2008 at the first place , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Inter@@ est Point of the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ence does not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which they fear a interest rate because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany in Germany .
to prepare a warm welcome , not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they belong to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still loves her 74 lessons .

Brazil Pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to clarify women about how important good food is during the lac@@ tation period . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by around 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the joint venture Bern@@ ried approved the construction request for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be flat for solar panels .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ key building at the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent church meeting , the elabor@@ ated building application was dis@@ soci@@ ated without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the committee , among other things , the committee had decided to adopt an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the valid construction plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be constructed with non @-@ mit@@ re first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; this way we get a wonderfully large southern roof together , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; Liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was prescribed for energy reasons - unlike in the construction plan - under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan does not allow &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Joint Council usually drives more restric@@ tive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
at the expense of costs , some 2.3 million euros are calculated .
subsidies are expected from school and lati@@ tude funding .
in the next step , the construction request for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be submitted to the district council office .
hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees pull from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this was confirmed by the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the tra@@ itor Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
a decision about this , however , is the Supervisory Board , and the day on Wednesday , 23 September .
should the plans be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au by fishermen and the wider inner station .
the rooms are present .
the employees who can &apos;t work with Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change is triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year , and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the line from 1 October and to change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a distribution of the offer in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ emaker and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board has agreed to accept both houses until then next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ hip , which is still over 35 beds , is supposed to be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
up to now , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital was completed .
J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal government , is to be used as housing for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I conclude , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; As it goes with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say , there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer talks about the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understandable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as chief physician for over 30 years have not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened with closure in the past decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand b@@ aller of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are called tonight ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ ische HC .

hunting event with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been severely injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the aber@@ ration on a corn field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in use as the police ha@@ unted .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought into hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the criminal police are determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violence
a crime suspect has led the police to the body of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted to have killed young people and thrown their bodies into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
since Saturday 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to violence .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as the prosec@@ utor and police on Wednesday .
as a fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old arrested on Tuesday evening is also considered to be a suspect and the investig@@ ator led to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported on Sunday morning , after having arrived at home after a visit to a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the suspi@@ ci@@ ons , a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was finally found .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the authorities , the authorities asked the authorities to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the bodies in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented at the Haf@@ fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put it to the burden .
the further investigation will take place on the closer circumstances of action .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking a affordable lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is faced with a challenge .
the distribution of distribution on the German housing market has long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable apartments .
in order to meet the demand for affordable apartments , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this result is a study on behalf of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units will be finished in Germany .
this is missing 140@@ ,000 apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees are no longer obliged to live after the first three months of their stay as asylum seekers in an initial income . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of them hit the apartment market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the rental apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes significant changes in the housing policy of the last few years .
Germany is shooting a housing deficit which will be larger from year to year .
currently there were some 77@@ ,000 living units already missing in the metropol@@ itan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed un@@ willingly in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the lau@@ ts on the apartment market .
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita over the past few years has declined again for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to revi@@ ve new incentives for social housing .
this could be wai@@ ved to the tax @-@ tax tax and the basic tax for subsidi@@ zed dwell@@ ings are subject to temporary exposure .
according to the alliance , attractive fiscal depreci@@ ation possibilities are necessary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funding programme for refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state bank Kf@@ W &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes well with cities and communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a good week after the start was on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available .
now the project could even be raised up .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia arrange corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , there is practically no breakthrough anymore , since more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb An@@ no@@ un@@ ces to grant transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to deal with the neighbouring country Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked with the Sloven@@ ian Interior Minister and if it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the demo@@ lition of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees went to Croatia to reach from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported by the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
Hungary had sailed its border to refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , also make decent asylum procedures in Hungary practically superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to leave the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can travel through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbourhood of Croatia .
most stem@@ med media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came to the Serbian border town of S@@ id , both with the bus and Ta@@ xen .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to get on foot on the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter Gren@@ zz@@ ä@@ une .
for this , the border strip has other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v Civil War in the 90@@ s .
mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , however , no more refugees come after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 .
shortly before the closing date on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws are the overcoming and damage to the Gren@@ zz@@ a@@ ea as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted threaten prison sentences up to five years and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , there was a total of 94 asylum applications in the newly established &quot; tran@@ se@@ ons &quot; on Tuesday , almost all - 93 - the most important crossing of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were 40 refugees .
practically no one has a view to get asylum in Hungary .
according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the expi@@ red asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered before the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage which tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side last week .
shut@@ ters were disman@@ tled and one of the shooting camps in the border town was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express themselves to the purpose of this conversion .
after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants , however , were still in the country .
in Salzburg , approximately 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing regularly smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge festival , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy with the clearing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ern@@ stein Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train to Passa@@ u .
but because Germany was un@@ expectedly dis@@ continued on Sunday because of the refugee flow with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein concluded , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and followed the rocks together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border to the Na@@ he Passa@@ u .
before that , we had the un@@ hoped guests at once , with a snack and a drink .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have said the same , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not take it to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this very pleased us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the str@@ anded train passengers went to a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u , after the announcement that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still trying to try the border .
but the regional train was posted in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge festival connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , day before a two @-@ b@@ lower run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of an apparent policy :
instead of helping in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in order to help the establishment of structures that guarantee human@@ eness , our Chancellor has officially opened the position of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this policy is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the poultry will also have to find that the &quot; landed country , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp .
it will be a great challenge , considering the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , with us to produce decent conditions for protective seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 hi@@ ber@@ nation @-@ solid neighbor@@ hoods
Konrad has filled all hands with the refugee support .
Christian Konrad is accustomed to his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to raise neighbour@@ hoods for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen &apos;s initial acceptance centre has already received a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees came to Austria on Monday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; masterpiece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the Interior Ministry spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad calcul@@ ates with a demand of 8@@ 5.000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5.000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal states .
should there be more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Konrad said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already led talks with the heads of the country .
they would have assured him to create quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it &apos;s good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , and will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator also sets great expectations in the ORF promotion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps as we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
private individuals can easily offer accommodation on the platform .
in addition , you are hoping for hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it may not be that quarters have to comply with a certain amount of towel holder or size of the upper light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he was successful with his experience in contrast to the Interior Ministry .
I am an older gentle@@ man , whom you do not say without further ado into the face .
persu@@ asive power is its most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier don &apos;t produce any costs as they explained themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees three to four .
the own source search was not yet successful until now .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with approval .
Linz calls for a better distribution
for the time , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees plans the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as one can currently refrain from taking these measures without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for the emergency , however , other locations should be checked for their suit@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ise the city leader in the division of refugees within the federal state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other districts also have to contribute their contribution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , provincial governor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has acquired further action in the refugee question on Monday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the protective seekers , however , were brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger asked once more increased solidarity in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria takes control of its borders again , for P@@ ühr@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general san@@ ction of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industry line is officially concluded .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly tra@@ ded IT Group S &amp; T is drawn , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clever minds are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in start @-@ up companies of the New Wer@@ ft and later on which to acquire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is distributed by Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for further 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the ar@@ cade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of the new shop .
in fact , Jut@@ ta wanted to get a dog .
this project had to move the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the exchange market ar@@ cade : after all , it has now gained growth in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which they sold bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets from 75 Euro .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously several weeks were rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I thought about whether I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , which are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has placed Br@@ eit from her mother into the cra@@ dle .
I think most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in galvan@@ ization , can also not answer the professional woman with the last security .
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag is upgraded every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also connects some of the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
whether he expresses himself foreign @-@ hostile , journalists are concerned or revealing knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office is pushing the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ an town of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate million are coming from .
the New Yorker with the com@@ eback fresh@@ ur is a concept for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road .
some people in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant place is related to him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they are somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter species , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous sp@@ ines , to which in addition to Tru@@ mp also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of the heart .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp is already a bit a big mau@@ l , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ ference , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - to Hoch@@ deutsch : the An@@ ders , she says .
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a place for gold mines in the USA .
the foundation stone of the real estate company were first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to the homeland , failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time .
he didn &apos;t record Tru@@ mp because he once had been cut off without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ic History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , explained to the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ ated , it is not so symp@@ athetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative tru@@ mp ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks rather dis@@ soci@@ ated by the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so hot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm , like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , men@@ tions that a descend@@ ant of the family Heinz came to the church organ for a visit to the church organ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is better if he doesn &apos;t want to vote , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wouldn &apos;t have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , who was inter@@ viewed for the Tru@@ mp for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 Kin@@ o@@ uns , even in the USA .
the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain@@ eering village . &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president at the Deutsche Alpen@@ verein , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the neighbouring country is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protective area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hurry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there are no major shifts in today &apos;s reviews .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the state capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the board seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers since Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities , compared to today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase in the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August , Today , the average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 60@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
so far in September Sun@@ rise stands at an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics had asked if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and struck easily The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe yiel@@ ded 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour was 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will vote confi@@ dently that Hot Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ ride the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three voices agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have probably un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , finally lan@@ det at Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was envel@@ oped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not be cheap if it is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we arrived with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you might accidentally have a clu@@ e to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed up to the final on Thursday
all three women have settled in a ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is put &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers become the game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house and saw ( Sar@@ ahs ) and S@@ ame energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible , and I have thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet on the ground , making it so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made it clear that Wood &quot; could be &quot; one . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now subject to him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was t@@ resp@@ ass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s an un@@ decided between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor &apos;s degree will be broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests for their impressive open day of training at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a smart decision .
some coaches had ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a fight as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ t at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a pun@@ t return and also into the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , who was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ent@@ ail for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine any worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne finished the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

El@@ ton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mik@@ hail K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky , Russia &apos;s rich@@ est man , was arrested on a Si@@ berian wheelchair with arms .
after having challenged President Vladimir Putin , K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky was condemned to confis@@ cate his oil company Yu@@ kos and under@@ took his democratic efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free voters demand the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
party and leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Herbst@@ kl@@ au@@ sur in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt in front of a heavy crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get into the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday to Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually , quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the Free voters meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will be transferred to the Klau@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it gave them during Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we don &apos;t go further , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
expi@@ red asylum seekers want to push the Free voters as quickly as possible .
for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W leader critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a uniform standard of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria shifts , others do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more handy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
many years of permanent bur@@ ners remain on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , the Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; middle level plus , &quot; where an extension of the gym@@ nasi@@ um intermediate level of three to four years is being tested - in the result it takes nine years to the gradu@@ ation .
but this is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all grammar schools who want this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
free drive at G@@ 9 anywhere , where it is desired .
fixed Wall Street helps Da@@ x on the jumps
after a long distance , the German stock market has closed its trend @-@ less and nervous trade course with profits .
only in the afternoon there was a strong start of the US exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upwards .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .
the Tec@@ Da@@ x technology @-@ resili@@ ent Tec@@ Da@@ x increased by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6,@@ 69 points .
Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 as Lei@@ tin@@ dex of the Eurozone declined by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
solid profits also booked the trade places in London and Paris .
the D@@ ow Jones Index recorded some 1 percent in the US in the US .
many Bör@@ si@@ ans expect that the markets will be on the spot until the end of the interest decision in the US and also for the great decline in the fut@@ ures listed on this Friday .
the debate around the loads from the nuclear issue has meanwhile pushed the shares of RW@@ E to record a record low and left deep traces even at E@@ on .
according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros on provisions .
the Federal Government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the Da@@ x tip .
according to a dealer , a positive report of the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; worked out from the weekend .
accordingly , investors gave a little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
in doing so , investments in promising w@@ afer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August , more cars were sold more than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show in Frankfurt .
the papers of the Daimler Daimler and BMW grew by 1.@@ 34 percent or 2.@@ 21 percent .
Volkswagen benefits declined by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market , the return on stock exchange rates fell to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
the Re@@ x pension index rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the federal government lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
the price of the euro fell at least 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars in the afternoon .
at mid@@ day the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars .
the dollar cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) euros .
4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber sh@@ outs on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rub@@ b@@ ish into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said a be@@ amer on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ stret@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , leading district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , with some of you threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said , the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before they resor@@ ted to rubber floors .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber floors , known by those known to be able to kill , which are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal at the southern level , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
August killed when the four large political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been governed centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legislature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legislature agreed this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
planning is a mixture of trade , commercial and residential - concrete offers are not yet available .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market some 4000 square metres of land in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and living .
you are waiting for appropriate offers , called it by the city .
which investor is in@@ quired is not yet clear .
no contracts have been concluded accordingly .
the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / Corner Large street , already a few months ago and let the building be disman@@ tled .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented publicly plans for the project for the first time .
some investors are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure activity
months had been negotiated behind closed doors , smil@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday settlement on the little sea near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the urban development committee of the Em@@ der Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , which preceded the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ asing went out of the system construction management into the offensive : &quot; we have not yet to answer all questions , &quot; he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to meet all ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
the project has been around ten to twelve million euros in the discussion for months .
the pictures and new details for the desired hotel building were highlighted by violent reactions among marine land@@ owners who had come to the meeting .
Roberto Schulz , sea owner and member of the Board of Directors at the Pres@@ i@@ dency of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that domin@@ ates all other bones . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears how many other project critics would greatly increase the traffic by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must come complete bus charges , so that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the good one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant , however , is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the plans are still variable .
welcome young at Gor@@ illas at the Frankfurt Zoo
the Frankfurt Zoo is looking forward to young people at his gor@@ illas .
the 26 @-@ year @-@ old Di@@ an has brought tw@@ ins to the world yesterday .
twin @-@ bir@@ ths are rare at Gor@@ illas .
the last one in a German zoo lies almost 50 years back and was also in Frankfurt as well , it is from the zoo .
the gender of the new@@ born Gor@@ illa @-@ tw@@ ins is not yet established , as Mother Di@@ an keeps her close to the body so far .

N@@ HC predic@@ ts 60 percent chance for cycl@@ one south of Cape Verde Islands
the US National Hurri@@ cane Center predicted a broad low @-@ pressure system about 350 miles ( 5@@ 60 km ) south of the southern Cape Verde islands , which has a 60 percent chance to develop into a tropical cycl@@ one in the next 48 hours .
another clearly defined low @-@ pressure system in the middle between the Cape Verde islands and the Little Anti@@ lles has also a 60 @-@ pro@@ xy potential , in the next two days to form a tropical cycl@@ one , added the weather experts in Miami .
Google launches dou@@ bling donation campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to help thousands of refugees who have over@@ rolled the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of the donation call on his blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey belonged to many dark railway and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family desper@@ ately seek help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google said that the first globally collected donations will double up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be doubled to 11 million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many fled from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .
reporting of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity sur@@ geri@@ es have proven to be efficient , but most studies have been performed at people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c acid formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained with those who did not have surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease decreased completely and at 28 % in part .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes only dissolved in one percent and partly with only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; were generally better found in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood levels of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , so the guiding researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reached greater return in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study did not show an advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 that are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because she says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long before we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have stuck their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is becoming increasingly important in Bell@@ et@@ r@@ istics : a young woman , too popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond love history , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her home town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot absorb all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to stop violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries was ad@@ mira@@ ble to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , it is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and set out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that has provoked unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of disinf@@ ect@@ ant infection by children over the last 4 years
poison control centers in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ lowed strongly alcoholic beverages , so Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue from hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years reported that the toxic@@ ity control centers report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them goes out in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children do not drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some are doing to impress their friends or because of a mutation in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragran@@ ces of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent which are very attractive for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
a few spra@@ yers can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation especially in small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t let a si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , recently taken four sp@@ her@@ ons of after straw@@ berry fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought into treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laugh@@ ed her words and was not able to walk when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors over@@ saw them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had hit his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store suspension disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario following the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contains meth@@ anol , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; gem@@ a &quot; teacher by using anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the promised plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ges@@ w@@ ät@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

Griff@@ i@@ ths playing talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates were not under increased control since they are preparing for confrontation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid@@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they do not show highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of the R@@ angers .
they speak about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent expul@@ sion from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men came from Aber@@ deen , which is now at the top of the table now with five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had already bad times before and we will come back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly so - but we must go on .
we really need really the support of Celtic because that makes the player better .
now together is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it rises in total .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 during the period of May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the offices for National Statisti@@ cs ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent in the course of the quarter - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year that Scotland has made the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later , except for late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
if it happens , and I hope it will not happen I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day came closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell all the story about the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available as places to decide who is chosen .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ ally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I developed my own relationship in the course of the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work against the death penalty will help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve done .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can &apos;t say that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty to be a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe there is no evidence to justify a death sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters to which you can contact .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man to see an unnecessary death .
man after damp police chase , persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he spoke the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt of a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he found himself in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want to &quot; see how too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to walk around the head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had uploaded the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stable .
&quot; before eighte@@ en months Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will call - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do in my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a fraud .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they have failed to grasp me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , the current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should I think that it will be personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and makes people outside trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it now .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will exercise pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration level was built up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him to &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the beaten master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the day @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ its , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take the full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has mistakenly applied mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day , which was so .
but it had so on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one has gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested for driver cur@@ sed
the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver cur@@ sed in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray @-@ Valley motorway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the driver continued to stop without stopping the injured driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy fights against ri@@ vals due to claims for ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling of his player as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbitr@@ ators allowed the Storm players &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a hardly covered note to the Storm team after his crew had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; good &quot; in rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the t@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said she was only concentrated on her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team will be confident , as they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring struggles when she met us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything at our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ tics to a real center of gravity , and that has provided us the trend revers@@ al .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny , as this always appears again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and recalls his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he would take care of a divorce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play them .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they did not think of us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks doing and there are no points of tension ?
for me , it &apos;s the game plans .
if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm team released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on Dru@@ gs
a man who might have a lifel@@ ong penalty threat@@ ens to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that were mu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Bundes@@ poli@@ z@@ ei found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America over Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ accused in the yacht harbour during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota Echo .
in spite of a potentially life sentence for trying to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the danger of flight at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of punishment , he lied the police over his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the secret explanations of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his Australian and his Serbian passport , in the police daily reports and is holding an initial lock from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : driving cab tears apart
on Tuesday evening , a truck driver has been severely injured in a vehicle accident with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe .
two of the three trucks participated in a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to ev@@ acu@@ ate the last moment to the left , as the police hur@@ ried .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ cause was completely apart .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed over six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to attract p@@ anc@@ ophi@@ le to sending images
a p@@ anc@@ ophil@@ er used the phone of an 11 @-@ year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , logged in an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children that were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately aler@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of this and looked at the five pictures , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research that used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
Ho@@ gg then claimed that he had done it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le in the internet , &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction to frigh@@ ten people .
he admitted that searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was to be done because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are p@@ onder@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and he said he would then see pictures of rape and murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on the trem@@ bling and crying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak with girls who looked much younger than he was .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , declared guilty in the sense of the indictment , in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , and did not appear before the court of hearing on 24 March this year .
defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ mes , as one can argue that &quot; there is no significant sexual element &quot; in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ cha@@ el dis@@ covers the verdict until October , in order to obtain background reports about social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted the deposit in this case , but was kept in custody due to hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was still recorded before the date of the judgment into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
tow@@ ing soft to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up from the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many bad users from fear of discovery and arrest increased people on smaller border transitions
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
along the border river Inn , Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn have been taken up more than 1000 refugees since Tuesday .
they were on foot through bridges and st@@ ow@@ ls to the German side .
there they will be accepted by federal police and for@@ warded to registration .
at the Munich Central Station , more and more refugees arrived at the Federal Police Station in comparison to the weekly start on Wednesday .
around 700 people have arrived in the state capital alone until 8.@@ 00 o &apos;clock , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
following the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : runners of Trop@@ ical Tower &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area across Western Europe , warm sea air currently flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful T@@ ief is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the Trop@@ ical Tower &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who had gone over the Atlantic over the past few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , the Black Forest continues to count on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the bottom of the ground with arches of 60 to 90 ho@@ ur@@ ly kilometres .
on Friday , the sun again leaves the sun again .
the mass makes it : every two years the motor@@ bikes at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , the compact car has to be seen , which is currently particularly well @-@ selling .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for by the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment alone .
this is reflected also at the IAA ( publication stage 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new top class and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand in autumn at the dealers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann said at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .
Opel launches a step below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen also offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively available as five @-@ door in a conventional and a sporty GT version .
in trade he comes next year , then also as Kom@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan depos@@ itor wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact infin@@ iti with its curved lines fit into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s declarations at 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which is visible at the IAA .
on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ er laid hands on the front part : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the folded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cells are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the judicial body Te@@ gel right , which was housed in a small cell for months .
due to the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this decided the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the judges , the judges can even hope for money if they were imprisoned only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man , who is now on the open foot after his lawyer , was moved into a larger cell .
his detention centre failed because of the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the country of Berlin .
but the Constitutional Court raised the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and transferred the case to the renewed examination there .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
although for legal reasons , only a few days of imprisonment for the compensation were decisive , there was a compensation for compensation .
otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a disgu@@ sting of the legal protection of the personality would be afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber of Appe@@ als must now clarify the amount of money compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
so they said only in April a prisoner of damages because he was imprisoned naked in a cell .
according to the decision of 2011 , the multiple allocation of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ worthy .
in addition , in addition to Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed with a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parallel fall in November 2009 .
the former plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated over three months daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ ago case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had also come into the head@@ lines in recent weeks due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included in 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to bats it should have been due to the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Court of Justice , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of young talent , 19 are to be dropped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
about 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany according to the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can create this , and we can create it . &quot;
what comes to Germany is the following overview .
according to different forecasts , between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) dwell@@ ings annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental properties : 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments come out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments , refugees will also apply .
the Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing should be created annually , and the federal government would have to invest a funding amoun@@ ting to 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , scientists and federal ministers agree that there must be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates of the Institute for Employment Research and Professional Research , 55 percent of the poultry slaugh@@ tered in Germany can be employed .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says Migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , a political change has been given : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the prohibition of employment for refugees to recognition of labour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while there was previously a ban on asylum seekers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation to restrict asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour , the view is enforced , that refugees should be able to get access to the labour market faster .
a great hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German knowledge .
so far there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most common through personal contacts .
the building of networks is therefore based on Thr@@ än@@ hardt the Königs@@ weg to work integration .
the Berlin school administration found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the root @-@ rooted parents it is only very important to hold the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ et@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ books in different languages .
if the demand for educ@@ ators increased strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students will be prepared without German knowledge in welcome classes .
they will not always be taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also of teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ables from Berlin &apos;s school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state prohibited asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , interior sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) but has abandoned its attitude .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prospective refugees could be facilit@@ ated by access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will not receive any benefits after asylum seekers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter generally do not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the eligible persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this financial gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam will play a more important role in future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state should gradually take the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state churches right to develop a new state religions relationship .
it is also important that the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights also belong to the rights .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on a clear contact person and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give him certain control possibilities .
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried in to Germany .
those who wanted to refuse such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
in the future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
in this way , the majority society will also need to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism becomes more urgent .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination point for a decade and a general equality law .
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U assass@@ ination series showed that the rac@@ ist motive was systematically ignored in the police and authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants organizations and the interests of non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time and why international agreements like the anti @-@ racism convention must become reality in the coming years when the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is capable of providing medical care to the previously expected refugees , says Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there must be additional money to flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to susp@@ end all arri@@ vals equal to the registration of health cards .
the services could be expected later with the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able , so many people have to leave with the limited power catalogue called the asylum seekers law .
otherwise , the doctors are making the language barriers .
so far , the Berlin Health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are more aware of their disease than other patients .
not only in clinics , but also in medical practices , interpre@@ ters would have to be taken over .
many refugees , however , have helped with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee camps , there are much more un@@ treated disabilities , and for the young people it is about HIV @-@ enligh@@ tenment .
with the partly other diseases of the disease German doctors from their training were clear , however , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as far as the doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may even allevi@@ ate relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly ex@@ ams ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees coming in Germany is psych@@ ologically ill after estimates of the Federal Psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; particularly vulnerable to refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z explains , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently published study of TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugees are traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called &quot; Flash@@ backs &quot; with breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms from chronic would be an early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
up to now , only four percent of psych@@ ologically sick refugees get a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically sick asylum seekers can provide an application for psycho@@ therapy , the processing usually lasts several months .
in addition , in the social offices most of the staff or doctors , who are not trained for the psychological illnesses , would decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ estim@@ ations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new staging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst takes back to the traditions of the cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to attract every age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the man@@ ege on the brick .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage staging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family for more than 33 years .
the gift for lovers is the family therefore in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to take people away from their everyday people and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ kind cocktail with world city flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus program convin@@ ces with talented artists from around the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family attracts the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , it wants to loose the Cuban duo loose .
ease and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast should conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with finger@@ tips and articul@@ ation .
balance with the wheel on a ball ?
no problem for He yu@@ an .
snake men fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , as little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mis@@ understand@@ ings in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also believes : &quot; it is not good for our animals , we don &apos;t go well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , as they are aff@@ ection@@ ate , will be read by the eyes of each desire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to get into the man@@ ege .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the top commandment therefore : good for the animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on their zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
so for every visitor , there should be something for everyone .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all our hearts . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to his performances every day from 17 to 20 September .
on Sunday , the program starts at 11 and 16 o &apos;clock .
Thursday is a family day , for the presentation at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained unchanged , but the video of the fall quickly spread over the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also deceived by the claims of members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech to the situation of the nation in parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the speaker of movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones who warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members of the Parliament that the immunity in parliament ends , and once they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 up to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
in this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service business activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , which should lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue and &quot; will be concentrated on the provision of un@@ riv@@ alled , integrated technology solutions for companies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says a company &apos;s explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electric plants and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring in order to manage the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field that is based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
the great shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that is not well healed .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ iel@@ en in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they were in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most injury days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from injury , you have a time period , a time when you have to strengthen your body and win battle force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
Arsen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger poses a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need to give a little break break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to pass through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , whereby the Ri@@ chter@@ sk@@ ala 3,@@ 2 was measured .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains from distant hopes to lead the association to its first European triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked with arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open , now more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove to be a 15 @-@ year @-@ long .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ism ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ a@@ ign against a miserable life ) 2015 was announced as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to question the men to seek help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study involving more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that if the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends so that a friendship can work .
in the age of social media @-@ guided communication , with their focus on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at cost in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
every character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality that gle@@ aned through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when football matches in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to each case even if they often hold back to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone counsel@@ ing it explained to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk is really clearly shown to me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she clearly presents the little moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you attend this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with which to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed backdrop , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could do .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets PS@@ G to help break Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head @-@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and chess j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish master , since they are not only aiming for the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities before the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he began his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 to create problems and look back to our opponents , even if there are certain things we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we have won , although I regret it was not yet another or two further goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which in the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was poured out in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ inian wing stor@@ mer was referred to as the man who was taken over the PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he ran in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he shut off Johan Wil@@ and to the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , it was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off hit in order to reach this level , stood at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle @-@ field is a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some fla@@ ws and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was not less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a passport from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , whom Di Maria turned into a shot , which was diver@@ ted by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ yer achieved his sixth season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and out of a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result could be low before replacement players E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern obviously stood before the obligation of Spain Super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played at the time for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times poker champion , four times champion league winner , two times champion champion , two times champion champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was standing before the departure from Barcelona before the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything , we do nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and also the FC Bayern registered .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern in summer 2008 .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change didn &apos;t come about .
and the decisive man is working today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he has done me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavarian Spiel@@ zeit would run in 2008 / 2009 with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , out@@ dated the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the reign of the King at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
as a result of the Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives and in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brown re@@ acted shocked , with offensive un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the act@@ ress of The Mar@@ tian were captiv@@ ated .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - as they treat the character of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te , which is beaten by her white sugar .
the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that her direction &quot; could give us something we do not want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded on Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; talking about the only black person in the room so he can explain its diversity - that &apos;s SO KNOW that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nationwide action and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to address discrimin@@ atory practices against color content .
in February the singer Prince made an appeal to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation , as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le that are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portra@@ yal of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope , is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowns the first champion
professional sport climbing and control aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of 1 million $ with home .
the competition show , which had just completed her 7th season , had never experienced a contest participant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Camer@@ am@@ ann Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten until the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete who finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fighting victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than $ 10,000 or have had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he gets a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he did .
he received a lot of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they would have changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was extended for an eighth season that will start filming in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins got a chance to climb to Houston Ast@@ ros in the second half of the American league game card .
for Detroit , if only for an evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp on a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inner ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw each game in the bull@@ pen and therefore I want to concentrate completely in the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the designated tiger H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the first triple hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he worked well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( stroke training ) , looked much better from the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three races at the end of the seventh inner , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape from the Right @-@ wing Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finish Run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the major league of the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a double play
after Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings , the Wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed man , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Detroit benefited at the start of the game from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been painted before the game from the injuries list after having missed more than a month because of a spinal cord .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was not very well beaten , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rel@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three races at six hits and a walk with four strokes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to an injury to the worm school .
he is studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August , on the injury list because of a shoulder @-@ down lashing , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP is kn@@ itted by Daniel Mor@@ ris from the list of injuries to start the T@@ wins .

the most enriched people will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the City of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 upcoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case over the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily accommod@@ ated there .
they should then be further distributed to other municipalities .

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collec@@ tives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , it was happy that the cup of a military involvement in Germany has passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends in front of our door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive up@@ surge of international aid on site for refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Austrian Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF , after Hungary no one will be sent back .
even Germany sent no refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the General Director for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concrete figures did not call them and rejected discussions on Wednesday in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came across the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria .
their goal is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU leaders , requested a special summit for next week .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the strong refugee crisis in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial intake and distribution of people .
the Federal Government will manage this together with the countries , announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who need protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany too .
this view was expressed in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia during the night on Tuesday .
a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to seal the border to Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ boat routes across Romania , Hungary Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new Gren@@ zz@@ au@@ n .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
in Turkey , because eye witnesses reported thousands more migrants on the way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the Eis@@ p@@ anz@@ er of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sw@@ apped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the moon dri@@ es easily on its way around the ring planets .
this num@@ bing movement is only small , but still too large for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it means in a communication of the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers are presenting their analyses in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even longer it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
in 2006 Cass@@ ini had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of the Saturn , the water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn .
at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .
R@@ ama is missing several weeks in Munich

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich &apos;s Lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expected to take four weeks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of a unified professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
Man@@ gos are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because Man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - above all su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them B vitamins and the vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain much vitamin A and its pre @-@ stage beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits , thus supports sight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too hard to smell and smell pleasant .
the color of the shell@@ fish only says nothing about how ripe fruit is - so green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
you should store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special note .
it mel@@ ts the slightly bitter taste of some bl@@ at@@ ts@@ al@@ ate like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

first f@@ atten@@ ing tower , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ ord side of the hair dryer , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz hur@@ ried on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night on Thursday , the hair dryer blows partly with storm strength due to the f@@ atten@@ ing valleys .
after f@@ atten@@ ing on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front that brings strong rainf@@ all , wind bows and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area over the British Is@@ les in a strong Sou@@ thwest flow .
on the alpine side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn breaks through the valleys in the night .
as a result , the hair dryers blow up until Thursday morning in the valleys with arches of 60 to 100 km / h , occasionally and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land , partly also with over 100 km / h .
the hair dryer can reach out to the adjacent centre of the centre , and on the mountains are even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , moisture begins to st@@ ow on the alpine slope .
here rain takes place , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , South of the Alps must be counted in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter , which after the last days have already fallen large amounts of rain .
on Thursday morning , the F@@ öhn enters the air , in which a cold front rolls with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from West to east across Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind winds strong until stor@@ my , and the temperatures go clearly back .
the following days are present in the north , with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the weekend , it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther seat
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of city president Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Reform@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was applied by the Arbeits@@ gemeinschaft of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es were often only able to live in secret their faith .
the place will be visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
in 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 , Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held in Rome in 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months .
he felt the city back then as a comm@@ anding sin@@ ful ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him in the view of historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
no , not at Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has won the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is not syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : the respective topics are adapted , which can be quite dark .
Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for about three years , for which he has met a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles which focus on topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , commandments , or fa@@ ther@@ land .
he was fascinated by several partners spontaneously : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , which is based on painting with the respective Bible points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he interpre@@ ts the Bible points selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into current relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible text of Martin Luther and each one of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old is allowed twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rohr@@ stock &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminds Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work up to carry me back to the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to help the art become more important in the fast @-@ lived time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is marked by advertising today , and it is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and joy to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer fall into the images , let them appear , discover and feel what force they have : &quot; the image is looking for his counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art has been to be : &quot; I like to live with his paintings . &quot;
old did not care to fully comprehend the Bible , but also selected for him important , also mysterious themes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alt@@ ep@@ ost says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from the Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened at Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on 15 November .
construction start for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn approaches
plans made , place found , companies commissioned to model Earth &apos;s hill for a round course : one year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was finished .
sec@@ rec@@ y in politics and administration , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want to tolerate the train .
so hill is de@@ ported to new place - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will take place in October , the first community in Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees from 2019 to 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football re@@ acts to the gl@@ itter@@ ing situation in Germany and safegu@@ ards politics to cope with the problems pending . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no one to say in principle , that &apos;s nothing about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone is interested in getting this topic in the handle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chancellor &apos;s office and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a key role in this topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could help and wants to help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the decisive turn@@ out has to put politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football League therefore has extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach declared at the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal states also support this program .
already at this weekend , the 36 professional associations set up a clear sign when they are held on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logos ( Her@@ mes ) , &quot; We will help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s Sport@@ chief Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes to everyone , nobody can see away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can use football states , no , we have to use our bla@@ sting power , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national team of women &apos;s 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale invites for the European Quali@@ fication Game against Hungary on this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large joint work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements have started their own projects , be great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a welcome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association will jointly provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees in cooperation with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP Management Board loses an eye in accident
the board of directors of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost the left eye on several reports by a fall in the beginning of July .
during the accident at the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he had fallen to a water glass after midnight , which he held in the left hand , reports the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost bleeding , was im@@ potent , has then gone out to the street - that he told us so last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ zard &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung , &quot; he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full of SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I stood in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually oscill@@ ates between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen so much . &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes of a com@@ eback by Marco R@@ eus have defini@@ tively sm@@ ashed in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the football league in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B @-@ Coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only alter its trunk eleven on the R@@ eus position .
thus he announced a change on the door@@ keepers position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of tribal tru@@ sts Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all Europe @-@ league games , Tu@@ chel left open .
with high probability he will also win the second game .
the for@@ ceful statement of Mit@@ er R@@ eus , that the final entry for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , holds mid@@ field player Julian Wei@@ gl for comprehensible : &quot; that &apos;s why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead a pioneering role in Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a pioneer in the change of cars .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , envis@@ ages investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the Autom@@ esse IAA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IAA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less stress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , which also come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase in digital radio broadcasting .
for testing new technology there is currently a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will review the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to employ around internationally that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has hitherto only seen the people as a driver .
when automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver gets more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
after a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still cars on public roads are expected to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far from 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location Germany value the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD traffic policy S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied .
the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute is the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the coming decade , 32 per cent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents expect up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the US 33 percent .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey of the digital verbal Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire journey on all roads .
on the highway , this could be 15 percent in flowing traffic , in the St@@ au 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car to control under no circumstances .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ ville Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM apprenticeship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who was among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant in Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at Kunsth@@ alle des Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his initially rejected attitude towards a show of his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when one dies , one gets into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ whose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having a training .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed overall artwork for which much effort was carried out : to fr@@ ze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired .
14 tons of material used the makers according to the Kur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October celebration there was still a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather h@@ osen outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy is also shown in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , delicate fashion tries of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he dressed his ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him .
he later taught the dra@@ fting of fashion .
he made fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it , of course .
for his first fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as fashion niche
in the past it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , which they worked for example for blankets and she@@ ers .
today , that alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ ors P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the beginning times of the P@@ lau@@ ener tip , fashion played a major role , was then pushed out by the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects past pens , is a growing potential .
anyone who does not operate in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
mo@@ dest@@ als P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener lace and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they may wear the protected label .
over the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private specialist shops and wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
today , mass goods are produced much cheaper nowadays in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains .
it also weak@@ ens export , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the USA .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to focus on environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the Nit@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg exterior office of the West@@ Saxon University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroi@@ dery and tips .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , it is necessary to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historical snow@@ ball tip .
at the same time , the machine sticks small chi@@ cks at some places .
the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße inspired me : &quot; before , I couldn &apos;t start with a traditional P@@ lau@@ ener top . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and the surrounding area and who would like to be a souvenir .
that is why I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener .

XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wide for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy has to open wide to the outside to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday a group that was commissioned with the steering of the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
encouraging new start @-@ ups and pushing forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; Xi said .
the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promoting state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population milking system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created which identifies sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance since it points to the market a major role in the allocation of resources , ensuring a right @-@ wing business environment and open the market open , said the statement .
the government will also have controls on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how they manage their business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
the law of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also attended Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to make consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve tissue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Consumer Organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding working paper on the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of mis@@ leading industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and infants , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous po@@ ison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; will be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m of fish .
however , big predat@@ ory fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury , that , on the basis of the current limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the catches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ comprehensible .
in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m .
but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they keep the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the distra@@ ction of distra@@ ctions , which only helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal that is strongly enrich@@ ing over the food chain especially in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; low volumes can cause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; premature damage of the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury comes primarily through coal burning into the environment .
according to a written information by the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants will come out more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount in Germany em@@ itted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish , such as in the Elbe , the Rhine and the Danube , was &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; had quoted the &quot; Spiegel &quot; in March out of paper .
last year , European warnings of mercury in fish have already been reported to the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
