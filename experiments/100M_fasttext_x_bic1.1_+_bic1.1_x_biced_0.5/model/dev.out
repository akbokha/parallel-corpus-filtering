Obama Rec@@ ei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington critici@@ zes Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement expansion and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
Barack Obama &apos;s deal on Iran &apos;s nuclear programme has worsen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu launched an controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not pronounced with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the election forthcoming in Israel .
in an emergency call professor , to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb excit@@ edly told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
within the house the officers found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was written according to the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , already had 300 miles to the school grounds , where according to the police he shot and killed a popular historian , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that all staff members have heard shooting at 10 : 18 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life as the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
a day after shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said that they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time , there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers who praised Lamb , said he seemed to be a bit nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would be no guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Professor William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs later , when he went back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 Lamb started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and education .
he completed his doc@@ torate in the spring in pedago@@ gy .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs called him intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
at that time he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a bath in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said she had been divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb meets Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertaining co @-@ ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 . September last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and dialect playing in front of a sp@@ oo@@ ky audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the clearing and j@@ oked with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of joke .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized on American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and student committee .
on Tuesday evening , about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commem@@ oration ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ enk@@ guard , while the Univers@@ it√§@@ tsch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect the police now saying that Lamb made the call after he shot Schmidt and that Lamb called Pr@@ enti@@ ss at his emergency call , but there is no indication that they have ever married .

while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is getting closer and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equi@@ p stores with employees who sell , ship , and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an im@@ pending documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated y@@ aw@@ ning and an arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back for the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever filmed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year @-@ long conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN Chief again ur@@ ges all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Secretary of State of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the Council &apos;s meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban requested the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in overcoming the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Survey results showing that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to fire him out as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks in surveys , it has ( yet ) not worked .
ten of the last 11 national surveys revealed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously question what it means for the opportunities of nomin@@ ating real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was led to the rise of Cain , none of whom had won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PAC@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tru@@ mp &apos;s per@@ sever@@ ance and start dropping their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values indicating that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp Pop@@ ular values revol@@ ved around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans looked at the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good view of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters were happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tru@@ mp would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they are &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see Tru@@ mp Temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , &quot; ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is seen in the nation &apos;s first pres@@ election state , I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality of a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his office , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament did not fit into the White House , as ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their hats , Republi@@ can voters think Tru@@ mp are real .
if asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nomin@@ ee , according to a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey from the past week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change from the time four of ten end of July set their money to J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet it is clear that a variety of GO@@ P voters consider Tru@@ mp campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp still beats almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tru@@ mp leadership , while anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed over more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp harv@@ ests majority support .
he points ahead of C@@ esar Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally in front of Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who hits him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the business@@ man with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans says they have formed their minds .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters supporting Tru@@ mp say they have set their votes firmly .
of course a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say that never change the mind .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
yet Tru@@ mp is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they match with Tru@@ mp in the subject of immigration .
since Donald Tru@@ mp called for &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , the immigration was turning and pi@@ voting in public discourse in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re @-@ orientation efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they match with Tru@@ mp in questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , it seems that Donald Tru@@ mp seems to do too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fru@@ stration over the government is climbing up to new levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all due to their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they would rather have a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; pol@@ ari@@ ously angry . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : Germany &apos;s five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods
here you find the most expensive residential complex in the Hob@@ s@@ ini@@ weg - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , one square meter of a re@@ usable roof house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special locations one square meter costs the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential locations , however , the price rises like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; V√∂l@@ kler has published a ranking of the most exclusive German resi@@ dences - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter , well noted .
but good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria &apos;s dream start thanks to M√ºller and G√∂t@@ ze
tw@@ os Tor@@ sch√ºt@@ ze in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas M√ºller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas M√ºller paved the way to FC Bayern &apos;s way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas M√ºller and Mario G√∂t@@ ze gave FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to M√ºll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ s. + 2 ) and i@@ dol hits ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth start success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot to Munich in the third run .
in his 28 @-@ th match in the Champions League to the Bayern @-@ leadership , M√ºller received the generous help of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who made a f@@ lange @-@ thought @-@ out shot of the World Champion .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the match in the Kar@@ ai k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 fans - and the Munich held word .
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his youngest six home matches in the top class , among them famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ √©@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went courage@@ ously , but often too mon@@ oton@@ ous in their aggressive ende@@ a@@ vors .
the attacks were introduced too often by shifting the game on left @-@ wing Douglas Costa , which rarely crossed the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
M√ºller had more luck on the right than his flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field sm@@ ashed in the left upper tor@@ so .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half of one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ St√ºr@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown hit the Polish head ball ( 26 . ) .
then by direct tak@@ eover , the keeper filed Roberto with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians came up with their usual domin@@ ating game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set up con@@ i@@ fers .
but beware of porters , Manuel Neu@@ er .
so , when he led a shot of ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er Guardi@@ ola left a four chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well .
Mario G√∂t@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cabin , was sitting outside .
the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training session , said sport steering Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; if you want to do something different from it , this is already vi@@ cious . &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
G√∂t@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , mil@@ led by El@@ f@@ meter .
before the game , it had come to Kra@@ v@@ alle in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly m@@ um@@ bled Bayern fans in their spect@@ ator block obviously provoked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces seized and went with clas@@ hes to the Munich fans .
at least one Bavarian fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study of Potsdam .
the good news : when ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk is reduced quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is the result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ val tissue , accentu@@ ates the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the relationship between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore due to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it may take over ten years to return to the level of qu@@ itting smoking , &quot; said Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich of the Birmingham University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Smo@@ king shor@@ tens the lifetime &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health up to high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness have been affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
archae@@ ologists find clu@@ es from the L@@ ate Anti@@ quity at Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer
for the first time , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said Museum leader Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction works on the Rhine , historians have been looking for so @-@ called ground monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as an expert office for archaeological site preservation .
in the third construction stage of the Rhin@@ e@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards , archae@@ ologists have now found what they are looking for .
it was already known from text documents that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , explained Trier .
next to the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with some 350 graves which probably belonged to the church .
young woman of freight cap@@ tures
after a young woman is inf@@ ring@@ ed at the station , the Federal Police asks the population for help .
in the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 o &apos;clock the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from M√∂n@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach .
according to the Federal Police , she has borne the most serious injuries by collecting the train .
she was treated with emergency medical care and brought to hospital by rescue staff .
on the basis of the noc@@ tur@@ nal crossing of the young woman , the investig@@ ative officials are not aware of any findings .
the incident could possibly be observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute on TTIP
to raise the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Free Trade Agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning corresponds to considerably more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ str√∂m in charge of the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the Free Trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TTIP is to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration are concrete evidence that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should come from the EU , the USA and third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against judgement .
until now , the parties united among themselves on refer@@ ees , there was no objection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; commented Malm@@ str√∂m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she wants to work on an international investment court according to her own data .
there could then be clari@@ fied , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , especially demanded by major corporations , are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , on which companies can enforce damage compensation of tax@@ pa@@ yers , lev@@ y national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements anti @-@ TTIP ( TTIP ) organizations such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; act the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was mainly critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German Economic Secretary , Matthias Mach@@ hart ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as big progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission included key points in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel elabor@@ ated in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ str√∂m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the business opportunities of the economy by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this meant that especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) talks can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered un@@ sustainable .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart on which the timi@@ d acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells the story of various places he repeatedly records on the map of his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they originated and what it looks like , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be wonderfully creative .
with the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; published in 2003 , clever@@ ly composed songs appear harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can drift into the great opul@@ ent at any time .
rum@@ or , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 US states should be followed .
but already in 2004 and in the near of the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has had positive expectations .
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
guitar and ban@@ jo are enough for him .
one year later , the musician living in New York is returning to the series .
in 2005 a celebrated masterpiece is published in 2005 with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exu@@ ber@@ antly in ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in none of the most influential music media at the end of the year .
after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then served on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic pieces of interest .
this sixth decent studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and rever@@ ber@@ ation .
since the smaller clubs have long gone away , the stage shows become a colourful spectacle of ne@@ on brow@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a band of five .
in the dark@@ ened ham@@ burger More !
he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell , &quot; which has been available since March .
although nearly 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the St@@ ev@@ ens , which has become clearly more mature , returns to in@@ timacy and folk music .
without directing a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the enriched album .
one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent , &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; sla@@ b . &quot;
only after an en@@ core is St@@ ev@@ ens mo@@ dest@@ ly thanks , plays acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally gets under thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Q &amp; A
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut has been eag@@ erly anticipated at the Prime Minister &apos;s Q &amp; A session
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Q &amp; A and to mark himself for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be raising himself in order to place the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , and his performance is prob@@ able by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; less &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s guidance , because after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet , he will attend the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration ceremony of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has provoked criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the centre of several front pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a speaker by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabin , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news night program , he advised Labour President to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of Shadow Mini@@ esters have refused to serve as leader in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are referring to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stance to the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour would make changes to eliminate the whole idea of limiting altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ worker and pensions minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to lower the 26@@ ,000 pounds limit to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory boss , across the Dis@@ patch box in Parliament over the last decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader , who promised a different policy statement , says he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crowd @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s question is too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he will refrain from &quot; striking &quot; and stri@@ pping with hooks , and instead endeav@@ ours to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister , will represent him if he does not take part - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally speak the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House of Com@@ mons to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy show , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted that he failed in it .
since it was broadcast on television in 1990 , the meetings with the prime minister were regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Com@@ mons and his position under his parliam@@ ent@@ ar@@ ism , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound is rising through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound boun@@ ced curi@@ ously for data showing a rise in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK increased by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the quick@@ est and quick@@ est estimate since 2009 at the time of an interest increase .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to ‚Ç¨ 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index made an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over offer of rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
based on encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that it had taken $ 2.5 billion by a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares of Mon@@ di &apos;s packaging and paper group were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % drop after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had placed his valuation for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports sales company reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages threaten the expansion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ gil@@ l says that a higher minimum wage for the UK workers &quot; could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labor costs of his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese on potato d@@ √∂n@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ √∂n@@ er ?
there are both - and in the potato d@@ √∂n@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger Imb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the &quot; potato instead of don@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay baked potato and meat together on a sk@@ ewer .
the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ √∂n@@ er , &quot; which he accidentally saw on television .
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer spaw@@ ns in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is multi@@ cultural for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea was to register Lebanon at the patent office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as a utility model according to the authority .
therefore , Al@@ hay is not willing to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the culinary tradition of international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash launches ground fighting campaign to combat al@@ di@@ - invasion
Met@@ cash attempts to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ a launched a land @-@ based campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ a and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
I@@ GA distributors and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and store shop@@ keepers who sell dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ a will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day .
there is a lot of stake in the game as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to about 14 percent in the Eastern states .
however , analysts such as Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and met@@ cash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
Mr K@@ ier@@ ath , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath , said that the loss in food and food business and the quantities at Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s could cost around 13 million dollars from interest and tax .
at the same time , cash divi@@ des market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s turnover in food and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade .
cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the executive committee of Met@@ a has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ G@@ AS &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Retail , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operating debt reduction while pressure on sales and margins .
wholes@@ al@@ ers , however , are resist@@ ing and investing more than 150 million dollars to match sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths every week for hundreds of products and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by fast @-@ growing fresh foods and delivering a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s CEO Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading refurb@@ ishment programs are going to grow at El@@ an , hoping that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit again for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ and , according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly deserved praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght by the not@@ orious confrontation of S@@ isi with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated by the arbitr@@ ator twice , with Har@@ rison pron@@ oun@@ cing : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat , and I should hit the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp tel@@ ev@@ ised a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the sing@@ les behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m interested in is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the argument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too tightly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he goes into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also did not consider the decision to take a look at the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term fixed component . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversy surrounding ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick made a very quick reference to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray pointed out . he climbs into the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary states emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those trying to illeg@@ ally enter the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no @-@ man land and re@@ acted with rebellion by Serbian officials .
the people who had fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two check@@ points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations grew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vers over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian pro@@ ot police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants would be returned from Hungary while more and more came from Macedonia and Greece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
talks with Brussels and other countries have to take place in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence in the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc could not agree on a common immigration policy during a meeting in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who had taken refuge in the conquered Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that , after the next month or until the end of the year , an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
however , Hungary did not put its hopes in Brussels or its neighbours soon .
the emergency situation held on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after having ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison passengers were deployed in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck and entry point in the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has , however , insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and non @-@ war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares state emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected to be expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , State Security Ad@@ visor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come here by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences of crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are here to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived .
chaos surrounding the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and press a crowd to push themselves there .
some 20 managed to get in but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton is still holding a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at a national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over against the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ election ( 58 percent ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is chann@@ eling for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the beginning of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored some gains .
Clinton keeps a huge margin in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased .
their support in the men has sun@@ k significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points back .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters for less than 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
however , Clinton has a huge margin among the older voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin for the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic elec@@ torate of prim@@ aries nationwide say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusi@@ astically support them .
while 48 percent of democratic voters say that Clinton is enthusi@@ astically supporting Clinton , less republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president becomes ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
from Clinton &apos;s supporters her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned .
consent to dealing with the problems and the elec@@ ti@@ bility are also cited .
as the vice president casts a potential for the presidential office , 57 per cent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - though a third believes he should not do so .
if democratic voters are asked of the primary elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
by Clinton &apos;s followers more than half say that Bi@@ den would be far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to can@@ oni@@ ze for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s edge ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; is increased .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Demo@@ crat voters call questions about the eligi@@ bility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as in the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters remains unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates perform good results in some key features among voters of the prim@@ aries of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best suited for hon@@ esty in the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic voters don &apos;t believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion on him .
democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no view of S@@ anders .
as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server will continue to be provided as Minister for Foreign Affairs , most Demo@@ crat voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions altogether .
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on their overall views of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion was still worse .
it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views have become worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy among voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the elec@@ torate do not regard it as an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of voters across the country see Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tru@@ mp receive good notes .
among the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush respond best to hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders to be honest , but as with Car@@ son , many don &apos;t believe him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Demo@@ crat voters in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to the nationwide survey close behind Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey close behind Donald Tru@@ mp
half of voters &quot; support in the new pol@@ l has dropped to the two candidates , and others dramatically lose their footh@@ old
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers nationwide . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also found that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and has sur@@ passed Tru@@ mp in Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is the deepest , and of 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former governor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at 6 % in third place .
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son goes into the poll@@ s - with 19 % support from the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest ABC News / Washington Post survey also showed Tru@@ mp clearly ahead of Car@@ son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a view to a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tru@@ mp &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go to the sea anymore : the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with it .
on the other hand , swimming temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of Bar@@ uch College Neul@@ ings
almost two years after a student died during a religious ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which contributed to his death , divided the police .
officials said he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the 911 emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ fully power@@ fully and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , thus the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide and put the welfare of the Brotherhood over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ zi@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was added repeatedly with a dul@@ ler force injury to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies on the ch@@ ic@@ anes each year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer representing the D@@ eng@@ es family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment due to murder of the third grade for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of victi@@ mi@@ zed attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also take this to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
an increase in interest rates , and the household is stag@@ gering , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long this will last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy provides only a small guide to the process .
a recession came after the first interest rate increase within just 11 months and took 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial investments react .
therefore representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so sharply that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could notice that the whole excitement could possibly be exagger@@ ated due to an increase in interest rates .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
here is a view based on historical trends , how some sectors of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can make things volatile for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there seems to be a tendency for asset records to be tra@@ cked 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest increases in the F@@ ed .
more specifically , the market has been in the past 35 years mostly in up@@ turn - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate increase , rather flat in the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average yield over the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , Head of Plant Strate@@ gic at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ denti@@ ally occur later in the raising cycle and the return will start to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that had not existed before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , nominal GDP has only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect that this will last and forecast only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such fragile economic cou@@ l@@ isse might be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants agreed all year on an increase in the interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could approve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading will only increase the likel@@ ihood of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increase cycles between 1950 and today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and placed before rec@@ essions very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shade , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
the fixed income was also volatile as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than when stocks change their strategic course .
in bonds the returns appear to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the hei@@ gh@@ tening cycle , the bond yields immediately fall , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer cooperation between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting that Jones states that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted itself to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending margins have expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that handle the larger part of their business in the US will benefit if interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt become worse , as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debt .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; stocks tend to react very positively for three months after an initial interest rate increase , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers .
firms with strong balance sheet have exceeded the average rate after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt becomes a major problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
savers could see profits through higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are , how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Member of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , &quot; says a leading member of the parliament and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not .
Conserv@@ ative member Andrew B@@ ingham also said BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen said that the public @-@ legal radio station was &quot; stupid &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishable from its commercial competitors .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; stupid &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also cited the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC general director dismissed the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works , I really consider it important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Contro@@ versy Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it was necessary to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC &apos;s production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport to hit the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated 22 million ¬£ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced &quot; in a special BBC fashion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to complete the order from further rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee pa@@ yers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose the slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 there was seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones
experts believe Black Friday slow@@ ed spending in November
for over a decade , the shopping mall has been bo@@ oming and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say there are signs now that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only show seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , then it has evolved over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that comm@@ utes and we will possibly experience that the growth will decrease .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing sales .
experts believe that buyers keep their purchases prior to this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers gathered around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that ¬£ 5 output was issued a little over ¬£ 1,@@ ¬£ online .
in some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident Get@@ killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first funeral in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia dis@@ covers the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane r@@ ushed
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed on Mec@@ ca &apos;s wholesale mos@@ que .
mour@@ ning crowded , largely dressed in white , the track to declare their respect when the first of the dead came their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession passed by the holy place , where only days before a building crane went through the roof of the mos@@ que and then fell on the worshi@@ ppers .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king ordered a san@@ ction over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the catastrophe that left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 Bet@@ ers who were killed when a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane under@@ pinn@@ ed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already said that the H@@ add@@ lers will go to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group should not have stopped the arm of the crane when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man v@@ owed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , pl@@ ung@@ ing into an inner courtyard of the Great mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which is taking place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group has published no statements on the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ amed the group for not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surrounding Mek@@ ka &apos;s big mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden family has been connected to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a sub@@ du@@ ed son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s .
the collapse of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of each healthy Muslim .
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( ¬£ 17@@ 4,000 ) to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other injuries receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European arti@@ sans is over
British are increasingly employing arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has risen behind
this leads to the opening of 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops targeting professional tra@@ des@@ people
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q shops nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out their work in their homes .
if you can handle a hammer or brush to paint walls , you seem to belong to a minority nowadays .
the British are increasingly employing arti@@ sans to carry out do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their homes , &quot; said the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V√©@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new CEO of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices has now sur@@ passed .
for this reason , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 new Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that focus on tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 points of sale from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions are hit by women .
at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households who make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must move this more strongly to a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a matter of principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the top of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group owed the cost of closing the stores .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , at the State Court of K@@ lagen@@ furt , two officials of the Austrian Volleyball runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and ev@@ asion .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
he has been acqu@@ itted by this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , the accused had cryst@@ alli@@ zed out that the defend@@ ants in the years 2006 to 2011 funds from club accounts , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , used for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials are also accused of financial years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact separated the president of the Sch@@ √∂ff@@ el@@ sen@@ ate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
the defence was accused of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity that an asset had not emerged at any point in time .
the sports officials were only charged with compens@@ ations and the sports club , for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , out of debt - the Passi@@ va amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then we stood before the situation : do we continue or lock the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread@@ making business of the financial department . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his co @-@ worker and co @-@ accused , he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have taken money , put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , no debt can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , in case of a corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of the reimbur@@ sement compens@@ ations had been made retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , a part of the compensation claims were paid off only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump sum and not detail bookings appeared , the former chairman explained the events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accounts and savings accounts administered the two defend@@ ants together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the second accused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the judge asked why the dis@@ bur@@ s@@ ements were not disclosed to the association in detail .
the association was not interested in the details of the financial crisis , it was important that only the freedom of debt had been , so the answer .
in 2011 an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the Club &apos;s account .
the defend@@ ants declared that these were appropri@@ ations .
this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know about it for a long time .
then he finally thought he believed that this was the best thing for the club .
if something happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claim res@@ titu@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why claim compensation ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first defend@@ ant explained that he did not agree with this wording , because the association had never done any harm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never received a cent salary , he merely calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ eting .
on diets he charged the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants were unable to show accurate documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept after an audit , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
the second defend@@ ant also referred to mil@@ eage .
all the exercises had to be done in cash , for which he had to go to the Bank from his place of residence to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard supplies another 30,000 jobs
in addition to staff cuts that have been ongoing for three years , the Compu@@ Ser@@ esis will reduce further jobs in the division of the company .
the sub@@ missions at the US Compu@@ terri@@ esen H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the breakdown of 25,000 to 30,000 locations in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs in the amount of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special burden of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be incurred as of the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 associates .
the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ share contracted 2.3 percent .
the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto group , which has become a company with printers , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printing business is to be bund@@ led in a new society , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data store for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a further dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services ranked the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo last last .
in the third quarter of the financial year , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
as a result , revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions on the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only late responded to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and getting more and more stores online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflicts : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct participation of German soldiers in hos@@ ti@@ lities in Iraq , however , would mainly result in rejection : 54 per cent spoke against it , 35 per cent expressed themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent find positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
24 per cent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
a collaboration with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , rejected 51 percent of the respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be responsible for this .
29 percent could not decide .

R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke : violence in the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police employed at the Serbian border at R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke tear gas and th@@ row@@ er against several hundred displaced persons .
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ √°@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the breach of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police , a police line had formed and a water @-@ th@@ row@@ er stood behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officers started to use pe@@ pper@@ mint first .
after that , the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees j@@ umped together and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Serbian police spokes@@ persons also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
times of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world is observing if the US central bank is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the most important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest was raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates will last at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Managing Director at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global relations .
she warned the markets to adjust to an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision will be announced at 8 : 00 p.m. CE@@ T on Thursday
death thro@@ wers at the Delta State University left ap@@ ology
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot at someone and killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb told the staff of the emergency call center that the police had to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening and he also mentioned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
as police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 that said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to , I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Professor William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss by Sun Her@@ ald .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a polic@@ eman caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb was awarded a doc@@ torate in spring 2015 from the Delta State University , as his life @-@ law on the university &apos;s website is available .
stars who have lost their lucky charm

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
150 of the world &apos;s roughly 1,000 executives will cost the Group restructuring the workplace .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot @-@ union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and appreci@@ ates Eu@@ row@@ ings &apos;s low @-@ cost eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment was a contribution to earnings of around ‚Ç¨ 500 million a year resulting from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will not be responsible for the passenger business in the future .
the budget line Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
Mr. Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the Management Board of Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new order Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the company plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employee has been complex .
the airlines were operating under the roof of the airline group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
the negotiations after the court @-@ stopped strike on this Thursday are to be resum@@ ed in the tari@@ ff conflict with the pilot &apos;s agreement cockpit ( VC ) .
this shared the union with .
the topic of conversations should be the retirement control for pilots .

the conflict between the union and airline resulted in several strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United not to play for months due to double cont@@ our
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven &apos;s Champions League defeat at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left def@@ ender to cry and will close it for at least six months from the game , Louis van Ga@@ al gives hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old sha@@ w had collap@@ sed into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it has a hard time and then plays fantastic , and then it happens .
he had an oxygen mask in the locker room .
he cried .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the im@@ position of an el@@ f@@ rom@@ eter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al presum@@ ed that the Italian arbit@@ er had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery now begins , I am coming back more strongly . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the PS@@ V &apos;s defeat
the UK distributor has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very serious injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the seat with this type of injury , all are very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno has suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction , so it looked as if he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very badly with it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ √©s Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ play by Chris Sm@@ alling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely , David Cameron is better known for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Lor@@ ax &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost extern@@ ally .
unless you are David Cameron .
when asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister opted for The Lor@@ ax , who was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it always seems to give an image or message we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
all nicely and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron re@@ port@@ edly describes the story of the book , adds instead a summary of the 2012 movie version that added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; amid the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage was , and who died in 1991 , however completely unknown .
as if that wasn &apos;t suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads partially as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears the local environment distorted by the money @-@ gre@@ edy , trees , Th@@ need kn@@ itting Once @-@ ler despite the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ly , car@@ eless creature , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a down@@ ing street spokesperson said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s election circuit .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there were no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still hard
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a down@@ fall .
A@@ last@@ air Cook &apos;s side may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali developed as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity at test level , is an option for the attack .
based on this news : Adam Ly@@ th is out of the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to let Adam Ly@@ th out is of course hard to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are geared towards results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , da - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully turns out further races for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not get so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is mainly a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer receives to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only repro@@ ach to raise was that England first introduced Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top shape - but this lost chance now lies in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a drummer , whom I highly in@@ timi@@ date .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this naturally depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of suggest@@ ing mos@@ ques beside Cook , which would provide an extra spi@@ der and receive four qui@@ cks , turned up and I did nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined Open@@ er in 2001 .
he made three hundred re@@ inde@@ ers straight away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made some smart additions to the training station .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes in for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can profit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the cabin , even if the messages are in tune with what has been said before .
Coll@@ i &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in the heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from the EU ) could gain approval if the economy gets into a sl@@ ump by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ equ@@ alled ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting into trouble with every day , even without the election of genius Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought fi@@ erc@@ ely because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at fre@@ und said recently that some member states are deeply ent@@ angled in various crises such as the EU it is and not always from own fault , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not wish to be sati@@ ated .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wishes a great Britain outside the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point in some capitals that they don &apos;t care about whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Angela Merkel chan@@ cell@@ or is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened in the exagger@@ ated long endurance like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French Fran√ßois Hollande is looking back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left one .
it is hard to imagine that they will break a leg to help the sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may intentionally not intentionally plan helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign is in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain won &apos;t gain anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did during the referendum in 1975 , which was inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can weak@@ en at Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opport@@ uni@@ sts , who has made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90@@ s .
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who was his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone hack@@ ers and the pseu@@ do @-@ non @-@ nationals who own most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar to her , but realized that when sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one better distri@@ butes ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
indeed , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , as Bla@@ ir had set the principle on the un@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him this .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly ch@@ aps on his back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s , a mistake then and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff tendency and the wild relatives of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary said &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &quot; s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet @-@ mates without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - keep in mind that he even stir@@ red me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe that allows him to maintain Lab@@ ours support in the reference campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n basic ambig@@ u@@ ities about EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of do@@ gmati@@ sm .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try , in all , to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already pretty disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health Report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partially with links to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
indeed , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to produce their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously reported by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also under@@ wrote the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that he received funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received after reports from tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not included , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also attended the tobacco management of P@@ he .
the Group &apos;s research work &quot; is sign@@ al@@ der@@ wise &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most of the criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , none of these links or limitations is discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Head of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that the BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually on a disease related to smoking , and smoking is the national health system two billion pounds per year .
by suggest@@ ing current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ on , For@@ mer Chief of Channel 4
the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ on and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs probably seen by a smaller audience in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC general director Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said he had been trying to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC commissioned or sent programs that were clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the House of Communications in his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to hold the broadcasting fee , which I do not consider in the medium or long term for a good idea , one should at least put his production on programs that others do not do or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time frame because they want to achieve as broad support as possible for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ oner is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
honestly , other channels would give their right arm .
I am trying to see how this public television should be .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who managed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for valu@@ ing reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts reflect what former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart speech in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ on .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they perform their tasks , and they can argue that if they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
for the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value from this .
of course you think all , we all think that one gets a great value for 150 ¬£ a year , but for people who are for the 150 ¬£ a lot of money , ask me if that is true because they do not consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their travel ethics mission to &quot; educ@@ ate , train and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC &apos;s production would now officially be classified as education - he said that there were 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and they should take an example of publicly available television channels in Australia and Canada , &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
to the question of partnerships El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a handful in television will be shown , and with the commercial tran@@ smit@@ ters will enter alli@@ ances to make all available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change direction at the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change direction at the moment in which they are be@@ amed with sound impulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ azi@@ ani , Res@@ ear@@ cher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the deep brain stimulation , a inv@@ asi@@ vely method that diver@@ ts electrical impulses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
th@@ read@@ worms usually do not respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ azi@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells that are assigned to them , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ azi@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels .
when using ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities to Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with pulses of light .
but Chal@@ azi@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that has to be sent down at an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ azi@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added .

V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertisement for the weapons fair - through a laying of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic shad@@ y company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ei@@ sh with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is the intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not illeg@@ ally traffi@@ cked in front of our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student residence halls
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved into a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have made angry - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entry into student residence halls ranges from slightly nerve @-@ wra@@ pping to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to chat : people tell wh@@ ence you are from , whether and where you have taken the Sabbath year , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; frank@@ ly tell Mar@@ mite to love nor hate because in serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not speak with , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burned in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave .
people &apos;s rooms are often transformed into drinks reception , movie night venues and community meeting points , but they are also places where people get dressed and put on their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ vert receives a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences are a space @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble@@ bee culture , which is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy that I have spent on interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow milit@@ ant is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos tank up : do it .
a guy in my residence halls had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship closes by baking .
since you start the university at the height of back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck at the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the greetings of the 1950 &quot; s welcome in the neighborhood , I have baked something . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad mixes of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the saying .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors if they had something to do , drum &amp; bass qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted to this with even more loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut off her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it would not be very embarrass@@ ing if you keep a room@@ mate for your future spouse , go to it , separate yourself again and see it every day and perhaps experience how it draws together all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot co @-@ inhabit@@ ant is definitely not your future spouse , at least try to persu@@ ade your body a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys lying in his non closed room , the boundary between an ul@@ k and mo@@ bbing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good coup is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give through hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson over security - but never miss one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but do not stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ cell@@ ed , low @-@ ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner relies on terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
for instance , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need housing space , but also the mother and the less ear@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how one can still build good and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push to the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner suggests to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for men remain largely here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have legally gone through my project .
especially complicated it always makes the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Ord@@ in@@ ance Reg@@ ulations .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees and asylum seekers have no cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which definitely is not correct .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true that we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but they have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the less ear@@ ner .
I show how to build a cheap and good building even today .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , typing in &quot; General &quot; and then &quot; software update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they receive an error message indicating that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush returns or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
that may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps in order to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by linking the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue because the phone may shut down half way and this could lead to an abor@@ tion of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , &quot; which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the membership number to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to K@@ ur .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1 . class and honorary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ √ºb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the Schach@@ club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , the chairman of Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players , which cannot bring up the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search are also to be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club &quot; Rot @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
district office is looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the senior centre Anton@@ ini joined the social foundation &apos;s coat and opened a new point of contact at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consultations , one can also take part in courses there .
the social foundation trains it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office has been opened there recently .
here , directly next to the shopping market , you will receive sen@@ iors and advice on questions such as the care insurance or services of the health and nursing homes .
for many years now , we have been using our out@@ patient nursing service to ensure that often car@@ egi@@ vers are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; not in@@ frequently , many services of the insurance companies are not taken into account , because the complexity of the insurance policies is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new manager Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ini and the Om@@ bud@@ sman as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to do this , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , you can use additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the Senior Centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is seeing both business leaders in particular demographic change .
because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future essential .
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined during the inaugur@@ ation ceremonies , the district office also dedicated itself to the association in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite you to a regular soci@@ al@@ ising . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar surroundings .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Saturday from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 .

Vienn@@ ese architect , Karl M@@ ang , 92 years old
Karl M@@ ang , one of the do@@ y@@ ens of Vienn@@ ese architecture , is dead .
he already died on September 5 at the age of 92 , as the K√ºnst@@ l@@ erhaus shared on Tuesday .
with M@@ ang , the K√ºnst@@ l@@ erhaus was a honorary member and , at the same time , &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was called in the Foreign Office .
born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical College in Vienna near Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute leader .
from 1972 to 1983 , he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the 1980 &quot; s , he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury in the Vienna Hof@@ burg and the refurb@@ ishment of the Lob@@ ko@@ witz Palace to the Austrian Theatre Museum .

men beating in 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ em@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 p.m. , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den to Sal@@ omon &apos;s side .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters according to the police and called them to wait for him .
at this time the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now cried out to the young man and struck him with his fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al leg and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first dropped off his victim .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their apartment and passed several times there demonstr@@ atively .
when the vehicle wasn &apos;t seen any more , the injured one went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
under the aid of a head@@ stock one re@@ counts on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured person had to be hospit@@ alized for medical treatment .
to date , only a vag@@ ue work description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 metres tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police are asking for witnesses and sign@@ posts to sign up under the telephone number 0@@ 6@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros
Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank M√ºller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ill@@ ausen .
also , the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about that .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : there Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over the practice of Fel@@ low@@ ausen on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his side in the next few months .
after a conversion phase M√ºller opened the practice again on 12 October , until then he invested ‚Ç¨ 3@@ 10@@ 000 into the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us stra√üe 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when Frank M√ºller and his wife , Dr. Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , met , who are currently completing their vocational training at the Dresden Hospital and who also want to enter into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the garbage cans would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was time I just called it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea was pleased by the M√ºller couple in the future to pursue their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old M√ºller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also see his own boss .
and so one agreed that the mil@@ ler bought the house with the practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank M√ºller grew up there , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several doctor &apos;s offices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen . in addition , he was appointed Chief Medical Officer in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district in 2009 .
from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ low@@ ausen , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ istin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mil@@ ler , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a general practitioner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
furthermore , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the mil@@ ler receives a total of 50@@ 000 euros as part of a funding programme of the county ( 25,000 euros ) as well as from the community ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that practice continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sam@@ t@@ Community Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients are in the field of rock breaks each quarter , while in North German average practice there are about 500 .
there is another GP practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank M√ºller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ de@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor has found himself , she would have gone too .
by the way , those who visit M√ºll@@ ers &apos; consultation hours also continue to look especially in familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms .
with their farewell in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminds Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long time , she sen@@ sed a little melanch@@ oly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients even more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pushed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone seeking asylum can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is par@@ amount .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia fails to consider &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses to
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to continue the incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Minister of Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , did not look quite like this in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the external border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia does not want to comply with its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to arrive in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id during the night hours to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police could pick it up in the nearby cor@@ n@@ fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have constantly been taking place in the Croatian town of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country , with some 4,000 refugees , said Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ lava from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , consistent with Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the Belgrade Government , however , denied that it was the people to approach certain routes : &quot; we can neither , nor do we want to do this , &quot; it said .
according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses were expected .
via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the way all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border crossing Serbia around 500 kilometers away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary closed , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could in fact lead to the postpon@@ ement of the Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary already predicted to be a somewhat further west route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control possibilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country prepared for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees plans for possible exceptional situations .
he did not call details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot;
strict controls are performed to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since consistently delivered a good testimony to the country as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on Serbian side , there are approximately 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the remaining refugees want to continue travelling to the Croatian border is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down Wednesday morning at a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be a very high number of refugees at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields , even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
B√∂r@@ sen @-@ H@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who has been accused of gaining insight into un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the collected information , insi@@ der businesses should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , according to the investig@@ ators , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately trapped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 other defend@@ ants in the case continued .
most of the accused come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators are to have acted in both the United States and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mann@@ heimer Par@@ ade@@ platz .
people do their err@@ ands , sometimes fast pac@@ ing , partly jo@@ vial .
they control the two stations of the Mann@@ heimer Aut@@ os@@ al@@ on at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep urban railways .
puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with stunning autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four big plates each with the inscription &quot; Before I die I want .... &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid drew attention to her 20 @-@ year anniversary with this action and is quite faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by for questions and conversations as the volunteers .
while some people spontaneously grasp the chal@@ k and take the phrase &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; can read , &quot; &quot; stop war &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t suffer for long , &quot; others remain briefly , read , say sentences like &quot; I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on .
over and over again little discussion about the action on itself , about life , dealing with dying .
also Peter H@@ √ºb@@ inger is on site .
&quot; only if I realize that at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian work Mannheim , which is in common with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ que carrier of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ic hos@@ pi@@ ce aid .
this is why this public effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
the fact that not everyone wants to share it publicly , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , even though the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the opening of the people .
an assessment that An@@ geli@@ ka shares Go@@ def@@ roid .
the death and mour@@ ning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted with a personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid looked for volunteers by calling an honorary official , she immediately reported to her and had been there during the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the victims and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
they are all trained meti@@ cul@@ ously .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can handle her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity , hold it precious and value the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations for relatives and associations enables the training as well as further training and supervision of the death and mour@@ ning companions .
every two years training for new employees will be offered .
the pla@@ ques on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
further personal wishes can also be recorded on postcards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered its profit prospects for a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body@@ work service .
the company also said that she plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at that time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell more than 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said a gain of $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than with earlier pre@@ diction .
analysts expect a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
despite the increase in price increases , the lower forecast is 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on January 4 , and despite higher sur@@ charges for ground transport of heavy and large packages , which are raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected the result to be increased compared to the previous year due to lower costs , higher revenues and growth in online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; delivers solid earnings when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for vacation employment were announced one day later than those of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to stop 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve analysts at Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ ack &apos;s questioned analysts predicted $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has experienced a decline in international priority shipping over the past few years , which brought shipments to stagn@@ ation in its Express shipping unit .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales in the Bo@@ dden transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the express unit recorded higher revenues because of higher prices while the result decreased because of higher labor costs in the freight business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the market trading , about an hour before the opening , F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at its most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strateg@@ ist spent two days this week sitting around a 27 foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the benchmark for the first time since almost a decade .
threatening over them at an end of the orn@@ ate two @-@ story cour@@ t@@ room , there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set up the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a tw@@ o@@ fold mandate from Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices stable here .
but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision which is too narrow to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be re@@ conc@@ iled by the unprecedented stimulus from the close @-@ to @-@ zero current interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in global financial markets may make the already careful F@@ ed representatives afraid to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest for federal securities - and even though it is only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which will uns@@ ett@@ le the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest rates this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a wait of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance for an increase .
this points to a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts sof@@ ten the strike by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average j@@ umped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she must go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest rates would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the sentence was expected .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate sank to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although the inflation ran continuously under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial mean value fell by more than 16 % in May when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would th@@ wart global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation when it is expected to increase interest rates .
&quot; if events had not occurred on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Basi@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US central bank .
now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed has become the currency authority of the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can expect that they not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noticed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ner , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates interest increase , made decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited discern@@ able impact on the growth in the US , &quot; Lack@@ er said .
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives cleared these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only put aspects of financial stability to the first place during a severe crisis such as the market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s Inter@@ est Con@@ fir@@ mation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent tur@@ mo@@ il doesn &apos;t come close to that level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation where she is afraid of interest rates because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think it should hurry the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Leben@@ shilfe for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees are coming to Germany these days .
preparing a warm welcome does not work without the dedication of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still loves to teach her 74 lessons .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er home at the D@@ ill@@ inger Stra√üe .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language .
of course , this is quite different from a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes healthy breast feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck breasts that are painted with portra@@ y@@ als of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build up a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adap@@ tion that mothers should carry out .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ried sports hall
the Bern@@ ried municipal council approved the application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited gym@@ nasi@@ um building on the Bern@@ ried sports grounds is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent municipal council session , the elabor@@ ated construction application was consec@@ rated unanim@@ ously without any major discussions .
prior to that , the committee had , among other things , decided to submit an application for an &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; or &quot; liberation &quot; from the current development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a non @-@ mit@@ otic first and roof survived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
in the case of &quot; liberation , &quot; in turn , it was about the a@@ version that was supposed to lie below ten degrees for energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
for this reason , a &quot; liberation &quot; was necessary because the development plan for the a@@ eg@@ ulation of the roof does not allow &quot; exceptions &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ ina municipal council usually de@@ parts more restric@@ tively in the case of liber@@ ating contracts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs are estimated at around 2.3 million euros .
grants are expected from school and lati@@ tude .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall will be submitted to the Council of the Council for review .
clinic P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg Hospital should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time Dr Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is seen by the surprising plans of the District Court of the County , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü confirmed .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board and the conven@@ ed Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü .
employees are informed of the plans .
the change is triggered by the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now changing to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
the question of who should succeed was according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; in the game , who agreed to take over leadership from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means &quot; upgrading &quot; and spread the range of &quot; internal medicine &quot; in each case , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees , will lead both houses until then next year the former hospital of the squ@@ ad , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met ru@@ mo@@ urs that the house , owned by the Federal Government , will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; I close it . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several considerations .
currently , there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a day @-@ care psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer said about the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; positively and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fisher@@ man has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg Hospital ( once 100 beds ) was seriously threatened in recent decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand @-@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar @-@ Li@@ ons is required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 hrs ) at Berg@@ ischen HC .

Jag@@ glo@@ omy with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the aber@@ ration on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Witt@@ enberg County ) several hunters were in use as the police informed .
after a firing sl@@ ump , an 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old suffered serious injuries and were brought into hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the crime police investigated .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate missed since Saturday .
in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young were killed and their bodies thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to a crime of violence .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as the Prosec@@ ution and Police shared on Wednesday .
as a matter of fact , a 20 year old arrested on Tuesday evening is also deemed to have taken the indication and the investig@@ ators led to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after having returned home in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the case of interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , a suspicion arose against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the presum@@ ed perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the arrested , the authorities said that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the cor@@ pse was placed in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be brought before the magi@@ strate on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a dead stop to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; information about the immediate circumstances of action should bring further investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns of apartment gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable ble@@ ach .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution of distribution on the German housing market has long since begun .
with the arriving refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they compete with low @-@ income citizens for the last affordable housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units will be finished in Germany this year .
this means that 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
refugees are no longer required to live in an asylum seek@@ er after the first three months of their stay .
many people then come across the housing market and enter the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers were living in the last year .
the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant savings in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is shooting an apartment deficit larger from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently some 77@@ 0.000 living units were missing in the metropol@@ itan areas , Matthias G√ºnther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in need of accommodation in flat @-@ house rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained un@@ willing to stay in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the dol@@ drums on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita had fallen for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social Hom@@ ebu@@ il@@ ding &quot; proposes a restart .
new incentives are to revi@@ ve the social housing construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could be dispens@@ ed with on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real estate tax &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats will be suspended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also , according to the Alliance , attractive tax depreci@@ ation possibilities are necessary .
the supporting programme for refugee accommodation in the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the roughly 300 million euros have been retri@@ eved on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the project could even be raised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia direct cor@@ rid@@ ors
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no passing through to Hungary , as more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous however .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior , and if it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian interior minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and belongs already to the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the deportation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees went to Croatia in order to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television channel RT@@ L .
Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , practically eliminate decent asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring Croatia in the morning .
according to media reports most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as with taxis to the Serbian border town S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk through the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter border f@@ ences .
for this the border strip boasts other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
in Hungary , however , there are barely any more refugees after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 .
shortly before the closing of the gate on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws stages the overcoming and damaging of the border fence as a criminal off@@ ence .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted are threatened with sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authorities , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; Tran@@ sit @-@ ons &quot; on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important crossing R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two elderly persons .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees stuck there .
practically , however , no one has any chance to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the transit zone in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in the past weeks .
barriers have been broken down and one of the host families in the bor@@ der@@ line has been rebuilt .
no one wanted to comment on the purpose of this reconstruction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reaches only a few refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but around 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government instructions .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees frequently met on foot .
mayor ro@@ uted &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; after the bridge festival on Sunday we were busy with the cleaning up when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ einer mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted by train to Passa@@ u .
but because Germany had suddenly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flood of refugees , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the bor@@ dering with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border to the Na@@ he Passa@@ u .
previously we had the unexpected guests first dressed , with snacks and drinks .
we said the same , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ √ñ@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the train passengers str@@ anded on Sunday evening had moved from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u , after the short announcement that rail traffic was shut down to Germany , but still trying to cross the border .
but the regional train was set off at the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge festival linked with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday , Monday before a two @-@ b@@ lower run sports - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ √°n sent more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of an apparent policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of helping R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke in order to help the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has raised the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ly@@ re @-@ bear@@ ers of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praised land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has invited them and welcomed them , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , in view of the ongoing refugee streams and the coming winter , to produce decent conditions for protection @-@ seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad at the look@@ out for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ resistant quarters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the support of refugees , Konrad has all hands full . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place districts for the thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chaos at the first reception centre in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gotten a grip on Con@@ rad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was also carried out without great fuss , said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the last year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide the federal states , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no drum without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the Gover@@ nor of the Republic .
they had promised him to make quarters for the coming refugees too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it is well done , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂n@@ born , which will explain how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations on the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help like us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily provide accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for placing them as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it is not possible for district providers to comply with a certain amount of the towel holder or the size of the upper floors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a limited time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ rad explained that in contrast to the ministry of the Interior he was successful in placing an accommodation , Con@@ rad explained with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man who doesn &apos;t say fal@@ seh@@ ood without further ado . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier don &apos;t inc@@ ur any costs in the republic , as they themselves explained .
they want to increase their number of employees in three to four .
his own quest for maps has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
however , there are obviously problems with the approval .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center for accommodation of refugees plans the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons concerned can currently be accommod@@ ated without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , other locations should be checked for their suit@@ ability .
the chief of the city council is critic@@ ising the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make a contribution here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed off &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , provincial governor Josef P@@ √ºhr@@ inger ( VP ) has set out further proceedings in the refugee issue on Monday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be no more special trains with refugees in Germany for the time being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the protection @-@ seekers , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ √ºhr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Run@@ t@@ astic is a Mat@@ ter of Time
the general renovation of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Linz Industrial Line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group is sub@@ trac@@ ted in S &amp; T , while the rest ( 27@@ 00 sq@@ .@@ m. ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can imagine investing in startup companies of the New Wer@@ ft and later to acquire which ones to acquire .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of remaining area in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent there are en@@ quiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on fur@@ row hand@@ bags .
actually Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog .
this project had to be moved by the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the pi@@ geon market ar@@ cade : after all , she has grown up in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which they sell among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets from 75 Euro .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I had a long time thinking about opening a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Linz area that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has put Br@@ eit from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
to me most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women are rap@@ ed at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional woman cannot answer with the last safety .
maybe it &apos;s due to the fact that a beautiful bag will enhance every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ f√§l@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp arrived from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
some people also associate this property with billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become U.S. president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for set@@ offs .
whether he expresses himself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , concerns journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office ar@@ gues vigor@@ ously for the election campaign .
and cut it off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ √§l@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property billi@@ on@@ aire deri@@ ve .
the New Yorker with the fo@@ eh@@ am@@ fresh@@ ur is a concept for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road .
some people in the 1200 inhabitants &apos; village is related to him over ei@@ ghty places .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in election mode .
the K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del filmed a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they are somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their &quot; K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , including Tru@@ mp also includes the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t bring it to the king of the hearts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , there is also the opinion that Tru@@ mp &quot; is a bit &quot; a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - to Hoch@@ deutsch : the don@@ or , she says .
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a ta@@ vern for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
foundation stone of the real estate company were first real estate purchases in New York .
but the lives of the grand@@ parents were not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland for a long time failed by the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged .
he did not record Tru@@ mp , because once without permission , the Director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly spoken absurd about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall in order to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; as he pol@@ ishes , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tru@@ mp ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the American rather dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so dev@@ out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the landlord Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some c@@ aller stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the family Heinz ended up with something for the church organ , which was generally well anchored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that of Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t win the election , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who were sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah B√ºh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tru@@ mp has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , even in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .
the Upper @-@ Bavarian commun@@ e Ram@@ sau bei Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
from the hand of vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the mand@@ ated Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to assume leadership in today &apos;s Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son come to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there have been no large shifts in the Today reviews .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side seemed to have no role for Australian TV viewers to play since Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators in the five major cities , compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today , a slight increase in the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , Today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed .
in August Today , Today , 3@@ 18@@ ,000 achieved an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50.000 .
up to now in September , Sun@@ rise stands at 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change concern this morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ st@@ ar from Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently swe@@ at@@ y father who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand achieved a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and struck easily The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos; Ke@@ efe , gave an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour there were 7@@ 20,000 people .
average of 6@@ 20.000 Hot Se@@ at .
the decline in the odds of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that failed to over@@ shadow the Mc@@ Gu@@ ys Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may unknow@@ ingly obviously know who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , where Sam Wood finally ends in The Bachelor , was sh@@ rou@@ ded in sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before from three two , you might accidentally give an indication of who will be the vic@@ tor .
Sam Wood continues his lips to the final on Thursday
all three women have ly@@ rical phr@@ ased out why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , when the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods Last Rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; could their answers become a game destruction who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the whole show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
from their point of view M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit made it clear last week that Wood &quot; could be the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this obviously is not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ condition@@ ally set on it , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in moving to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent en@@ quiries after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ nes for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a don@@ ald as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ t at his first pun@@ t @-@ return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a pun@@ t return and also to the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the match .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also openly strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the match .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Zel@@ in@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , who was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian band had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut then in 2007 , when a passport at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free voters demand the employment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn l@@ ump in Gro√ü@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned against a serious crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools , when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; Ai@@ van@@ ger said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get into the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Friday election of the Free voters conven@@ es in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e until Friday .
actually , quite different main topics were planned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the Free voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ camp the retreat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ van@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ van@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as it gave during the Yugosla@@ v Wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not like that , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ tor Chief . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ van@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards for federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria is shifting from , others are not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in the big wall should not fall under the table .
a long time favourite remains on the agenda : the educational policy .
for the new school year , Minister of Culture , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; Middle @-@ stage plus , &quot; in which an extension of the grammar school intermediate level of three to four years has been tested .
but Ai@@ van@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums that want this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

fix Wall Street helps Da@@ x on le@@ aps
the German stock market closed with profits after a wide range of direction @-@ less and nervous trading developments .
only in the afternoon was a fir@@ mer pr@@ el@@ ude to the US stock exchanges for a clear direction that ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points upwards .
the M@@ DA@@ X average values gained 0.@@ 54 per cent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .

the Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 as the leading code of the Eurozone dropped by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
solid profits also booked the trading places in London and Paris .
the D@@ ow Jones Index in the United States recently noted about 1 percent in plus .
many B√∂r@@ si@@ ans expect the markets to take place until after the interest decision in the US and also for the large decline in the fut@@ ures markets on this Friday .
the debate about the load from the nuclear phase has temporarily pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low and also left deep traces at E@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3,@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
on the Da@@ x peak , Infin@@ eon shares rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent .
according to a tra@@ der , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; looked after the weekend .
according to this , investors are paying too little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
investments in future w@@ afer technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid off .
car values were in high demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August , more cars were sold than in the same period last year , such as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .
the securities of the automobile manufacturer Daimler and BMW increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ in@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior district official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , some of them threw stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal told the police had deployed tear gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , known to be capable of killing , which are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ k@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal by the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th century .
killed in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal which has been ruled centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators ha@@ sten@@ ed the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week , and officials have said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the land at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter space .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers yet .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den town wants to market an area of approximately 4,000 square meters in direct proximity to the Old Post Art Centre .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
wait for appropriate offers , it is called by the city .
the investor in@@ quired is not yet clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no contracts were concluded accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which lies at the ring road / corner of the street , already a few months ago and the buildings being demol@@ ished .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of a holiday housing estate on the Small Sea in Em@@ den take shape .
the Investor creates plans for the project for the first time .
many residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure activities
for months I was negotiating behind closed doors , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den are situated on the table .
the prospective customer , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Municip@@ ality Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP Group , which repro@@ ached the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y management , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ased went on the offensive by the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all the questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
the project , which is around ten to twelve million euros , has been in the discussions for months .
violent reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ d owners who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details for the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and member of the board of interests of the An@@ gli@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge block that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears how many other project critics will strongly increase traffic through the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be entire bus loads to make it worthwhile &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what is happening on the well @-@ established grounds of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the development plans are still variable .

Google La@@ un@@ ches Dou@@ bling Don@@ ation Camp@@ a@@ ign to collect 11 Million $ for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ run the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google has an unusual personal approach to announ@@ cing the donation request on his blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather than letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google associate , f@@ lown with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; our journey included many dark train and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations tot@@ alled $ 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / Phoenix to $ 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven over 4 million people this year .

coverage of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; editing by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if obes@@ e people with diabetes continue to live longer after losing weight surgery than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss sur@@ geri@@ es or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity sur@@ geri@@ es for type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient , but most studies have been performed in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng general hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c lymph@@ oma - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation sank from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 .
among those undergoing surgical intervention , 36 % of the diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was completely dissolved and 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and , in some cases , only about two percent .
in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c reflecting the blood glucose levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , according to the leader researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater dec@@ lines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete overall overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was about 29 percent less likely to die during 15 years with obes@@ e people who were subjected to obesity surgery - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study did not show any benefit to survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I among 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point in this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies between 27 and 30 with his BM@@ I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long before we get people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated those genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ r√ºck
it is a topic that is currently attracting increasing attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
so even in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story , the novel should be especially interesting for H@@ uns@@ r√ºck readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist Guide called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech to the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also emphasized that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he emphasized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and comm@@ enting on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; toxic Control Centr@@ es in the USA report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who swal@@ lowed strong alcohol dis@@ infection agents , &quot; said Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income from hand dis@@ infection products rose from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are getting more and more interested in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children dis@@ infection products intentionally drink while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ing in the social media .
YouTube videos show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
young people have said that disinf@@ ect@@ ants are mixed with alcohol containing mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ infection products ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent , which are very attractive for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for infants , a few sp@@ lashes may lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Po@@ ison Centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not let si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave these hand dis@@ infection products within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume plenty of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sp@@ lashes from straw@@ berry odor@@ ant hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought to the clinic in an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered dr@@ unken with an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated her at the twin Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah defeated their words and was unable to go when they arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through alcohol and hit his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ h &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been fatal for my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were connected with death cases .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing suspended disinf@@ ect@@ ants , containing toxic , non @-@ declared ingredients .
health authorities associate that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students from the fourth grade in New York state planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ gs them out of their room .
the police viewed the simplified plan as &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p , &quot; and referred to disciplinary action to the school authority .

there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about Dish@@ ar@@ mon@@ ie at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch tab@@ ular leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scotland te@@ ens Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers @-@ Mittel@@ feld player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they do not show highlights of Celtic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will turn things around , swear by Dei@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ √∂ and the following departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who now has a five point lead clear at the top of the table .
Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we feel this exactly the way - but we must continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton careful in January transfers
despite his comments only a few weeks ago , suggest@@ ing that he r@@ ushed a few January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious in signing new entran@@ ts and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x squ@@ ad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former head of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the storm , and added , &quot; It is safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ dice &apos;s Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that the management board of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but it is said that the decline must end in the field of play .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back on track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen was desper@@ ately struggling against Hamilton &apos;s cies to see a seventh successive League victory , which brought them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no team that won anything , in cups or le@@ agues , which games of this type won &apos;t win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK , it is growing overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period of May to July , while the number of people without labor for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Office for National Statisti@@ cs ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland dropped to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken interfer@@ ed with the process

why I Will Be Wit@@ ness of an Exec@@ ution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I shall see a man being put to death .
when it happens and I hope it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day came closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and since more applications are available as places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the course of the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we laugh often when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a bl@@ amed me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better phr@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he &apos;d do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to mention all the details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of deed .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I &apos;m sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after wet police persecution , persu@@ ades to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he persu@@ aded the man of the c@@ anning river .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang up the police was un@@ successful when he found himself in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , just a few yards from a police officer trying to &quot; persu@@ ade him gently to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called to remain in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t get too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited to make his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
championship football player Ben c@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy states that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy states that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at Ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobal@@ t @-@ t@@ amp@@ on test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he had retired 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age charges and did not want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have long been waiting for it , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know it went on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk raised head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy to rac@@ ing.com .
they evi@@ dently believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if this is the case , they should certainly grasp their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to seize me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard K@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the point that it will be personally ?
did the R@@ V@@ L behave in a cow@@ ard@@ ly fashion and maybe makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and cast me away , and I have no doubt that what I say makes them think about it now .
but I have now arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels were set up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t examination , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the beaten Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , usually called the &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; day @-@ to @-@ day treatment , after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my colleagues wrong@@ ly applied mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday all day , which was so .
but it also had it on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one has gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made an almost disgu@@ ised note to the Storm Team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the tri@@ ck@@ lim@@ b of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; at the tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers in his team agree with him confi@@ dently , since it meant that they were worried about being hit by the Storm Team .
&quot; this time and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson replied about ring@@ ing when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we did not change anything about our defensive system or techniques all year round . but in the last six weeks we made our contact with Tac@@ tics a real focus , and this has provided the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and obviously he has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is strange , as it always appears at this time of year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting it was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he would take care of a mess .
but now he has a team that can play and that we view as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have these kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like them .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ x was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me , it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm Team released this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ eed for Dru@@ gs
a man who may face a lifel@@ ong penalty for his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and put in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the yacht port during the morning and later in the Caf√© Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole crowd and that in the caf√© could have been a harmless reason .
the judge on the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the Court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ lu@@ ent declarations of the two people it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions he aband@@ ons his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police daily and feels at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : cab tears apart
in a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late , trying in vain to turn to the left at the last moment , as the police informed .
the driver &apos;s cab of the crash culp@@ tor broke completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 am .
the result was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when he was asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of incomplete pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the bewil@@ dering messages and immediately aler@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used terms to search for in@@ decent images of children .
Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction , that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people .
he admitted that searching for the computer was done by him , but he said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
after his talks he was asked with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did so to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , saying that he would see images of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone , she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and weeping .
she also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the charges viol@@ ated by children on 14 June last year , on 25 January this year , and not to appear in court at a hearing on 24 March this year .
defense attorney Gregor S@@ im beg@@ ged that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the sexual offen@@ der &apos;s register , argu@@ ing that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; can be found in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ cha@@ el postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to get background reports on social work .
in this case Ho@@ gg was granted security deposit , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings on other pending cases .
he was included in the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
smu@@ g@@ gler switches to Germany &apos;s small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken up from the main control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from fear of discovery and arrest increased the number of people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
along the border river Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were walking through bridges and wei@@ rs to the German side .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and for@@ warded to the registration .
compared to the week start on Wednesday , the Munich Central Station again met again significantly more refugees .
some 700 people arrived in the state capital until 8 : 00 a.m. , a spokes@@ man said in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city .
Stuttgart : deser@@ ters of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the south @-@ west expected
meteor@@ ologists are warning of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe warm ocean air is currently streaming into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) distributed in Stuttgart .
the strong low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn over the Atlantic over the last days from the Bermuda Islands .
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , even up to Thursday morning the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and the Lake Con@@ stance Circle with bows of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour can be expected .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer .
the crowd makes it : every two years , the car manufacturers show their innovations at the IAA .
in 2015 , the compact car segment , which is particularly well @-@ selling , is especially noticeable .
cars from the compact class are particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Pub@@ lication date September 17 @-@ 27 ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year .
one of the major premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel is launching an entry below the largest competi@@ tor VW Golf , starting at 17,@@ 650 euros .
the current Astra cost from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse also offer other diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time .
unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially just five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which will also be seen at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault M√©@@ gan@@ e : Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor to the race .
at the trade fair , the M√©@@ tro is only to be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and sporty GT version .
he enters the trade early next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan driver wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti fits into the brand &apos;s design line with its curved lines .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is in accordance with manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe will be launched in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
outside the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ √´@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger put their hand on the front part : the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the resur@@ rec@@ ted Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy of human dignity
the Federal Constitutional Court gave a right to an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary institute Te@@ gel , who was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was lod@@ ged in a solitary cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on the loose foot had been moved to a larger cell .
his position of office because of the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the Land of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Court raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and rejected the case for re @-@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of pen@@ al days for the compensation were decisive for the compensation , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cal@@ am@@ ity of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ als must now clarify the amount of money la@@ under@@ ing .
in the past , the Constitutional Court has often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
so they only spoke to a prisoner in April because he was locked in a cell naked .
according to a Dec@@ ision of 2011 , the multiple allocation of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ worthy of human dignity .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had att@@ ested to a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parallel incident in November 2009 .
the former plain@@ ti@@ ff had lived for three months between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had come into the head@@ lines over the past weeks because of lack of staff .
for this reason , prisoners are imprisoned again and again for 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to massac@@ res it has already come about because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justice Press Office , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of lack of young talent , 19 are to fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
according to the opinion of Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to accept a million refugees according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Interior this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do it and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany is the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments yearly - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 250@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings ) .
but the lack of living space is dramatically due to affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social hous@@ ings are out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
far too little is this from the perspective of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social housing would have to be built every year and the Con@@ federation would have to invest an amount of 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
scientists and Federal Mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in residential construction .
according to estimates of the Institute for Employment Research ( Institute for Employment Research ) , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mig@@ ration@@ alist Dietrich Kaiser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , according to the Thr@@ es@@ man , there has been a political revers@@ al : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Resi@@ denz@@ pflicht , which limits asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in the society , even because of the shortage of skilled workers , the point of view was that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market faster .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lack of knowledge of German .
until now there is no sufficient offer in general and professional language courses .
research shows that jobs are most often facilit@@ ated by personal contacts .
for this reason , the structure of networks is the Royal Road to work integration , according to Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the de@@ pu@@ dent parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ et@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration .
in order to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ bills in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators rise sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for instance by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students without any knowledge of German will be prepared for classes .
but they are not always taught by teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , Be@@ ate St@@ ones reports from the Berlin school administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , no federal country prohi@@ bits asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception has been Berlin , the sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; willing refugees could facilitate access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a compensation or dump@@ ing receive no benefits from the asylum application law more if they begin studying .
in principle , the latter do not receive a B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of voting persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 1 January 2016 this can be shortened to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this gap also needs to be closed , for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually admit the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ of @-@ government law to develop a new state @-@ religion ratio .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
rights also include duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be ready to work with the state in many areas and to grant him some control options .
this also includes the willingness to deal with religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
those who wanted to take up such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law into Arabic .
in the future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole of society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more urgent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law for almost a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it slowly learns how the NS@@ U mur@@ ders showed that the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive systematically .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long been calling for and requiring international agreements like the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany have to become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to use its possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care for the expected refugees , &quot; says Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all newcom@@ ers to hand out health cards immediately upon registration .
provided services could later be bil@@ led with the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to leave as many people with the limited scope of services that the asylum seekers employment law provides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from that , the doctors especially make the language barriers possible .
so far , the Berlin @-@ based health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are less educated about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , but also in medical practices , interpre@@ ters would have to be taken over .
it would have helped many refugees with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
for example , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities in refugee camps , and with the young people it is about HIV / AIDS .
with the partly different clinical pictures , German doctors are aware of their training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ asi@@ tism or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a sophisticated education system ; some refugees are even doctors .
in order to practise , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly ex@@ ert ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill according to estimates of the Federal Psycho@@ therapy Associ@@ ated Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; particularly vulnerable be refugee children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Dietrich Mu@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich demonstrates that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with breathing difficulties , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ burn and death .
other symptoms are sleep and concentration problems , strong timi@@ dity and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
Mun@@ z explained that in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment was necessary .
to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can apply a request for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the social offices , cler@@ ks or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .

&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , an animal teacher and junior chef .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current stage production .
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
so the gift for fan@@ atics is in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take people away from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; increase cocktail with world city flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
cir@@ cus &apos;s program convin@@ ces with talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the International Cir@@ cus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v c@@ lown Family attracts the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of silent films , the Cuban duo wants to take in easily .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is meant to capture female hearts by storm .
apart from numerous salmon alt@@ ough , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the cir@@ cus also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and articul@@ ation .
balancing with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascinated with her mot@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphas@@ ises Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often the subject of different animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we are not doing well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each mat@@ ing unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called will be read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to get into the arena as well .
the top priority is therefore : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together for eight years in a enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
for each visitor , there should be something about it .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if there are five or more 200 people , we always do our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks at his performances every day from 17 to 20 September .
on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is a family day , for the show at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , the animals are open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , stepped down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by the opposition &apos;s alle@@ gations that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned against accompanying Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s intervention with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
last month they had booked it and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; Death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members of the Parliament that the immunity in parliament ends and as soon as they leave Parliament their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers of politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will be split into two listed companies this year , and will separate computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the expected job cuts will lead to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said HP in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive Officer , who will lead the unit after separation .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today and we have a broad and deeper portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ matched , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s declaration .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electro @-@ plants and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring in order to tackle the turn@@ out of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that closely focused companies perform better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand before the match against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and when his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , his participation in the European Championship will certainly be uncertain next summer .
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to its old momentum during the previous season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this type of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in conjunction with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injury , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has listed 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ al 157 league players during the last five seasons .
the broader picture of Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight game times since 2007 / 08 that have recorded most of the injury days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a resp@@ ectable time period , a time in which you must strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself to a rotation within the team .
H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ √≠n and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , which means that Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow players who need to have a little break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although arsen@@ al is clear favor@@ ites to advance through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measured at the Richter scale 3.@@ 2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and remains driven by the far hope of leading the club to his first European Cup triumph with his management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked with Arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ a@@ ign against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from looking for help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms discovered that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication @-@ guided communication , with a focus on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when watching football in cozy arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to it , even if they often hold back to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide really showed me how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that make sense when I try to offer more long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the little moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ si@@ ders status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the backdrop of the day totally re@@ designed , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k ?
or , even better if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know which difference could make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from start to finish - the entire 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ √∂
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ √∂ .
di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G pass by Malm@@ √∂ .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held classes when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ √∂ in the Prin@@ zen@@ Park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ √º@@ ts as PS@@ G player , who led the French Master on the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and chess Y@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris requires a strong start against Swedish champion because they do not only aim for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic example of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents problems and to look back relaxed even if there are certain things we still have to perfect over the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored another or two other goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could last on the weekend a 2 : 2 un@@ decided at his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ inian wing storm was called the man who could take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why when he entered into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ √∂ defense , before he completed Johan Wil@@ and beautifully into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , it was disappointed .
Malm@@ √∂ , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined the field at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field .
but besides a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in advance .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave itself up , with some mis@@ ses and bad conclusions , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who had sli@@ ps alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he showed a lot more skill in bringing his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who turned Di Maria into a shooting , which was hang@@ ed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . thus , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an received his sixth win of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all thoughts that Malm@@ √∂ could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and out of the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before substitute player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ √∂ , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core g@@ athers $ 2.5 billion through stock sales
the Swiss @-@ based mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is affected by the collapse of raw materials prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday by a stock sale as part of its huge debt settlement plan .
the London @-@ registered company Gl@@ en@@ core said in a statement that it sold new shares worth approximately 1.6 billion pounds to pay off its own debt .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling raw materials prices as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn presses the demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of reference rights brought Gl@@ en@@ cores stocks to the top of the London stock exchange on the early Wednesday morning .
the share j@@ umped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which was 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced last week the 2.5 billion dollar share sale as part of the more comprehensive plan to wipe around a third of its 30 billion dollar debt .
the company sold the new equity hol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 per cent of the Group .
concerns relating to long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by around half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .

the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
the Chinese president , Xi Jin@@ ping , will make a state visit to the USA at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and responds to President Barack Obama &apos;s journey to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the U.S. president and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also be hosts of Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ yu@@ an at a Sta@@ ats @-@ D@@ iner after the two leaders carried bilateral talks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President X@@ is visit will offer the opportunity to extend the American @-@ Chinese collaboration on a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but simultaneously President Obama and President Xi give the opportunity to construc@@ tively approach areas of dis@@ agreements &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was first announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on its way to Washington before moving to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and Xi are addressing a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged Chinese cy@@ ber sp@@ ying and increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 switching to FC Bayern
world champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona at that time .
eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champion league winner , twice World Champion , twice World Champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to Qatar for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was already in front of Barcelona before the European Championship 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ √ßa wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we did nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 J√ºrgen Klin@@ smann acquired the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this works today for the German record champion : pe@@ p Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ √ßa has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with that he got me . &quot;
who knows how Bayern &apos;s playing time would have gone with X@@ av@@ i 2008 / 2009 .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the lawn , the red turned out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays a great role in the film@@ making
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown tac@@ kled the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen script .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comment@@ aries of the actor of The Mar@@ tian began to soli@@ di@@ fy .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer @-@ mates Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to ask people to think about them - who will always be the director - how they treat the character of the Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said at first .
the only black person , and she is a nun defeated by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of De@@ ar White People chose the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film . Dam@@ on answered that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval via Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Mr Po@@ oni &apos;s Twitter user pushed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain its diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the head of the social debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement had a national impact and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to command discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured people .
in February the singer Prince made a recording on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
recently , leaders of the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate @-@ group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and guidance by Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of 1 million dollars .
the competition show , which just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten managed to finish in the final .
climbing on a 75 feet long climbing rope was part of the last task in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge for three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under shock at the prize of the Big Prize of 1 Million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had it for life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , it gets the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he has a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m happy that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , filming will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers gone past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
in the past they once were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins wa@@ ved a chance to climb up in one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American league game card .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to write about a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad An@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and enabled three ranks .
it was only his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw in the bull@@ pen each game , and therefore I want to go completely concentrated into the game .
the designated tiger hat Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two races , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has well sw@@ ung the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better at the Bull@@ pen and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back at the end of the seventh inning , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get into play again .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ te , and Simon finished his second bass driver Brian Do@@ zier before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy survived the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run away from right @-@ handed Dre@@ w ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the end run at the second , we brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a double play
after he added an insurance @-@ run at the end of the ninth inning , the Wall created a R@@ BI Double against the C@@ loser of the tiger Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
but the right @-@ handed guy stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
at the start of the game , Detroit benefited from an even non @-@ mo@@ ve@@ able Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been removed from the risk list before the game after he had been missing more than a month due to a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first place , H@@ ushes delivered a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos was followed by a single on the right , creating another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers ranked second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a big hit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not strike especially well , but he caught the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ Count , did not score points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and one walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z was eliminated because of a violation of the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the list of vulner@@ abilities since mid @-@ August , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris will be stri@@ ked by the infrin@@ gement list to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he was missing in the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees arrive in Wiesbaden
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people involved in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden shared on Tuesday evening .
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily accommod@@ ated there .
they will then be distributed to other communities .
over the past ten days , according to the presi@@ dium of the government presi@@ ding over for the first time , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse have arrived .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au , too , have arranged emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the resol@@ ute re@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective way@@ far@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , it was glad that the cup of military involvement in Germany passed by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria has again introduced control on its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday evening Austrian Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening no one sent back to Hungary .
even Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s agreed as it was agreed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did not call them concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come from Hungary to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of more than 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
in view of the strong refugee suffering in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial absorption and distribution of people .
the Federal Government will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel in the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Ministers in the chan@@ cell@@ or &apos;s office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined the people who needed protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was strongly divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort of force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees meanwhile stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest to turn the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary &apos;s foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , said that Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from visiting Romania .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
in Turkey , meanwhile , witnesses of e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported thousands more migrants on their way to the Greek border .

at least at the South Pole we had to give an underground sea , closed the astronom@@ ers back then .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear .

no Di@@ et Fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy and sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to their slim line are often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially sac@@ char@@ ose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nonetheless : in them B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Pri@@ marily , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
anyone who eats the fruits supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying man@@ goes , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too tight and smell pleasant .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then naturally they taste pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go also gives hear@@ ti@@ ly dishes a special note .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaves like ch@@ ic@@ ory and ra@@ dic@@ cio .

first torch @-@ tower , then striking cold front
in the coming night , the F@@ √∂hn winds through the valleys of the Alp@@ n@@ ord@@ seite , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and on the night on Thursday the F@@ √∂hn blows partly with stor@@ my strength through the F@@ itz@@ t@@ eler .
at the end of the Thursday morning a striking cold front crosses us , which brings heavy rain , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a strong south@@ western current .
on the mountain@@ side , the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys during the night .
as a result , the F@@ √∂hn blows from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ i land , with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ √∂hn is able to advance to the neighbouring centre and on the mountains even the hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ my hair dryer ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees Celsius , moisture begins to st@@ ow on the mountain slope .
here the rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in sum , in the next 48 hours , some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter have to be reck@@ oned south of the Alps .
on Thursday morning , the F@@ √∂hn winds up the air , in which a cold front rolls with powerful , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind picks up strongly until stor@@ my , and temperatures clearly go back .
the following days are in the north @-@ east@@ erly with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south on the other hand it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Square in Rome .
on Wednesday a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former in the presence of President Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino .
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
on Wednesday , Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could live their faith only in secret for centuries as a minority .
with the square , it becomes visible in a symbolic way that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held a few months in Rome as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
he felt the city back then as a welcome sin ba@@ bel .
according to historians , his negative impressions might have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against the ab@@ duction of the Jews .
hammer Artist invested three years in the Bible &apos;s personal interpretation
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) thorn crown is one of the master@@ pieces that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with glorious pictures .
in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but this is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite dark .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
we have created cycles dedicated to topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , commandments or fa@@ therhood .
he spontaneously fascinated several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
and above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has been dealing with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
he interpre@@ ts the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and so into today , translated into current inter@@ relations .
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible text by Martin Luther and a set of the artist who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the cord has golden letters .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old to give twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter @-@ Orden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up , perhaps to carry me back with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim is to bring art back to more value in the quick@@ est time : &quot; today &apos;s perception of visual worlds is characterized by advertising , and it is loud .
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different delight and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wanted the viewers to &quot; fall &quot; into the images , let them work , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst has been : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
old did not care to fully capture the Bible , but also selected the mysterious topics for him .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; Alt@@ ep@@ ost says : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot;
for Hans M@@ √∂h@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ √∂h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas models - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opening on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn ( BM@@ X )
plans made , place found , companies commissioned , earth moun@@ ts for a round course model@@ ed : a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train , it was finished again .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration caused chaos , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill de@@ ported , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
permission will be received in October , the first joint venture Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen even more visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with works in the former indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga supports a clear signal on the weekend .
football re@@ acts to the worsen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures politics its help in cop@@ ing with the problems that arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to do with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B Chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chancellor &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the state minister Mrs. √ñ@@ z@@ ƒü@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and will help .
but the decisive course must be pursued by politicians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some federal lists support this program .
already this weekend , the 36 professionals set a clear sign when they will support the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports chief Ru@@ di V√∂l@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as a &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes to everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can help the Bundes@@ liga , no , we have to use our radiation power , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ heim managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Quali@@ fication match against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach called for the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large joint work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license clubs have started their own projects in their places is great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a welcome that we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government provides 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have also called for the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses an eye in case of accident
according to several reports , the head of the board of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the accident on the steps in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he dropped onto a glass jar after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost bleeding , was power@@ less , he then went out to the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go after his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the supervisory board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an interview with the S√ºd@@ deutsche Zeitung , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full of SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually oscill@@ ates between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such personal history , said the manager of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally sm@@ ashed .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the soccer Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ eling with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7.@@ 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot use it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ play against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B @-@ Coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from it to the training session on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high strain of its professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only alter its trunk position on the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change to the door@@ keeper position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of tribal keeper Roman b√ºr@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , whether wil@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all of the European league games in the future , Tu@@ chel kept open .
with a high probability he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ ceful statement of Mit@@ ch@@ man R@@ eus , that the final suit for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the target , means that mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wid@@ gl considers it understandable : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to take the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead the way for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in changing the car .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which envis@@ ages investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t talked to Frankfurt on Wednesday at the br@@ ink of the auto show IAA from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who also come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
among other things , the transport ministry &apos;s strategy paper highlights the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid increase in digital radio communications .
testing new technology is currently underway on a test track on the free@@ way 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks be imposed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wishes to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework and adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use it internationally for the maximum speed limit for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which until now only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver .
when automated driving , the car takes the lead increasingly , the driver becomes more and more passengers .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads will not be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German site for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD transport policy S@@ √∂ren Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the Germans are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey carried out on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the test organisation Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect it at all in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed expect up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the US 33 percent .
in Germany , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey of the Digital Network Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire drive on all roads .
at least 15 percent in flowing traffic could be expected on the motorway , and 45 percent in traffic jams .
well , every fourth would leave the car in control under no circumstances .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from September 25 to October 4 , the D√ºsseldorf Congress will only take up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the final decision shall be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to win the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer J√∂rg Ro@@ √ü@@ kopf during the European apprenticeship in D√ºsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor mine in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to come back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo the down@@ side , we are now no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; said one @-@ European @-@ champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the se@@ ed@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by this we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the World Ranking Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figur@@ ine cab@@ in@@ et : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : mannequins that look sc@@ ary human thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men into skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk on the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a little bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you die , you get to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely surviving work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed total artwork for which much effort has been carried out : to freeze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list has been hired .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers travelled to Munich for 14 tons of material .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , hes@@ it@@ ant fashion secret attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put clothes on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
with a doll to play , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him .
he later joined the design of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it , of course .
for his first fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewels instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener head as fashion niche
it used to be on the long stit@@ ching machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were produced in large quantities for customers , which they processed for example for blankets and she@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this alone is no longer working today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en automobile industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead , fashion is important again .
fashion plays a major role in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , and was then replaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt names some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styles , is an increasing order potential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they account for half of all orders .
together with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery .
only they must bear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , some 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private trade and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
our products barely reach the customer in this way .
today , the bulk commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively through chains .
moreover , exports are weaker , up @-@ to @-@ date after Russia and the USA .
enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association tries to score also through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains about the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been leading a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch office of the West@@ s√§ch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ der@@ ies and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , it is necessary to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ treated the historical snow@@ ball tip .
in doing so , the machine sticks small balls at some places .
the P@@ lau@@ en Gold@@ schmi@@ ed master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ √üe took inspiration from it : &quot; previously I couldn &apos;t do anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland , especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and the surrounding area and would like to have a mem@@ ento .
so I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plan new &apos; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &apos; film
legends are not to be touched , but Disney dar@@ es to find a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about a re @-@ in@@ filtration , but a kind of continuation which takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical n@@ anny .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the Great Depression in England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

XI ur@@ ges to open the world wide for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open wide to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was t@@ asked with the steering of reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote new start @-@ ups and drive forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group has adopted a set of directives , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , encourage state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) to absorb private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list will be created that identifies sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments .
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance since it as@@ cri@@ bes to the market a greater role in allocation of resources , guaranteeing a legal business environment and shaping the market more open , the statement said .
the government will also lo@@ osen controls over the powers transferred to the businesses and make sure that companies decide how to manage their businesses .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
within the framework of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
the right of the lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es and to provide consumers with a significantly higher dose of the nerve agent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding working paper in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industry and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch announced .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams mercury per kilogra@@ m of fish .
however , large predat@@ or fish are already so strongly polluted with mercury that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 percent of catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ conceivable .
in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams per kilogra@@ m .
F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p , are mostly so low @-@ strain that they already comply with the planned limits of today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering at Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous distra@@ ction which alone helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , which is particularly rich in predat@@ ory fish above the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts of particularly un@@ born damage to the nervous system can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Ministry of the Environment says on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
mercury is mainly due to the burning of coal into the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants run more than six tons of mercury in the year , according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish , for instance in Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and comprehen@@ sively exceeded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
