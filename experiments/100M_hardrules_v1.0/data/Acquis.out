&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol together . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedure to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of the section I on security measures .
the aim of the safety precau@@ tions set out in this Convention is timely detection of the tur@@ no@@ ff of significant amounts nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ r@@ ence from such a junction by the risk of early detection .
in order to enrich the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial interference and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the inspections by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the material quantity for each material forming zone is specified for a certain period of time , stating the accuracy limits for the specified seas .
in carrying out their audit , the organization makes full use of the security system of the community in accordance with article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material account zones .
in the application of their security measures , the Community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following type and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are intended and intended in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measuring system for determining the quantities of preserved , manufactured , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and inventory ;
B ) the evaluation of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estimation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , checking and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures for the evaluation of accum@@ ulations of non @-@ measured hol@@ dings and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and report system that displays the core material inventory and changes in the material balance zone for each material balance zone , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ures for the reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures under this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore preparation .
B ) ur@@ an@@ ium - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c ) , is introduced into the states , so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or is this nuclear material or other , in a later stage of the nuclear fuel circulation produced core material in the states , so it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not met , the Community is deemed to have temporarily not been possible or desirable from residues , so the organization and the community should consult each other on the use of suitable security measures .
B ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community agree that this material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
upon request of the community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the security measures according to this Convention :
a ) special spl@@ itting material when used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material when it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such nuclear material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
on request of the community , the organization fre@@ es core material , which would otherwise be subject to security measures under this Convention , from these security measures , if the entire core material delivered in the States due to this article is at no point more than
a ) a total of one kilogram of particular p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment , which lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium , is calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the core material is to be processed or stored together with the core material , which is subject to the security measures under this Convention , precau@@ tions are taken for the re@@ application of the security measures on that material .
the Community coinci@@ des with the organization of supplementary agreements which are necessary in the scope , which is necessary for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the organization under this Convention , in the individual , as the procedures laid down in the Convention are to be applied .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or amended without any amend@@ ment of this Convention in the agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake every effort to make these agreements come into force within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
based on the initial report stated in Article 62 , the Organization shall present a summari@@ zed inventory of the entire core material underlying the security measures of this Convention in the States , regardless of its origin , and continues this inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of its audit .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organization ) on the other
( GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EW@@ G decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource transfer problems .
C ) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States shall be bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement and , as far as possible , be issued within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
( D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the central bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organization of the EEC has presented a table that is visible in which way it intends to apply the criteria laid down in this agreement -
the Organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; Special transaction account , &quot; which consists of the funds that the member states contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this agreement ; this account is managed by the organization as &quot; ste@@ ward &quot; ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; ste@@ ward &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement , and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes of the member state , which must be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state at the order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the deposit point of the organization in the respective country .
B ) The payment is made in two inst@@ al@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the order within 30 days of entry into force of this Agreement or to any other between the EEC and the administrator at the appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the balance sheet as of January 1 , 1979 or at another time agreed between the EEC and the Administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may be able to make payments before the above dates on request .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes approximately proportional stro@@ kes to the cash or the school eye to cover expenses for the special transaction loan and balance the special transaction account in a reasonable way .
in the granting of these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC :
the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) of the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its other lending capacity to loan conditions without per@@ ks ; and
VII ) The extent to which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
any special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it is part of the organization &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices that are considered , approved and managed by the ordinary resources of the organization , whereby the objective of this agreement is to be taken into account under the b ) pre@@ am@@ ble for this agreement .
the funds of the special transaction account must not be used instead of regular means of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which is bound by a loan or credit scheme for a program or project , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of entry into force of this agreement .
apart from section 4 , special loans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms , which are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the organization ; thus , they are re@@ payable in ten free years each in 50 years .
special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this clock are to be paid directly to the organization which it retains .
each special transaction loan is to be as@@ cer@@ tained by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is specifically stated .
the proceeds from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services manufactured or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization and who according to what the administrator has specified at the time of loan granted , could be a recipient of a special transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments of a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in the currency of a member state is to be transferred to the Member State as soon as possible after its receipt as soon as possible .
the car@@ et@@ aker shall inform the EEC on the purpose and programs approved by the directors until the complete publication of all the re@@ active loans .
during the time of payment of the special transaction loan , the Administrator informs the EEC about the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this .
the car@@ et@@ aker communic@@ ates the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed statement of the transaction account with a statement from the external Audi@@ tor of the Organisation to this account statement .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC soon conve@@ ys a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account .
the administrator creates and conduc@@ ts appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid from the account to the account received and from the account paid out from the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker are working closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator until full output of funds from time to time provide an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the continuation of programmes or projects financed by a special transaction , and on all other issues affecting the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date that the EEC and the organization may possibly agree , the agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting from it are due immediately .
if the total capital amount of all the re@@ actor loans required by the recipients is paid back in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting from it will be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
the Govern@@ ments of the Member States notified the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
the General Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper authorisation of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organisation .
this agreement will be effective and will enter into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two signatures in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each word being equally authentic .

I honor you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes and suggest you as an appointment for the entry into force of January 1 , 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm with me the approval of your government .
I honor you to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm to me the approval of your government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of the Member States &apos; demands as part of the medium @-@ term financial state
the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit a corresponding request .
the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery opportunities from the member countries .
however , some conditions are already mentioned below that the BI@@ S would be ready for their application .
with each stand@@ by credit the BI@@ S would first assume an obligation for two years , whereby the possibility of extensions would be continu@@ ed@@ --@@ but not exceeded for a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans , as well as for any extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening fee .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draws are not made before the exp@@ ir@@ ation of a month after signing the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be taking into account the means of the Bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those applying the BI@@ S at the respective time on under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S has to proc@@ ure the required resources on the market , then the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum which corresponds to the corresponding margin of increased Li@@ bor .
I would be grateful if you would like to inform me about the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit a corresponding request . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would like to inform me about the consent of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I honor you to share the consent of the Council of the European Communities on the content of this letter .

- fresh or ch@@ illed h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( tari@@ ff point 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff ) ;
- frozen chicken , lamb and goat meat ( tari@@ ff point 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff ) .
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay to the Community are determined by the following annual amount :
in order to ensure a flaw@@ less operation of the agreement , Uruguay is obliged to ensure that the quantity in question does not exceed the agreed quantity and is carried out in accordance with the traditional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form be possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee under number 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the Community takes advantage of the protection clause , it under@@ takes to ensure that the Urugu@@ ay@@ an access to the Community market regulated in this agreement will not be affected .
in case the imports from Uruguay in a year exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year in question .
the Community under@@ takes to restrict the exhaus@@ tion to the imports of the products collected from this agreement to a ho@@ of rate of 10 b.@@ H .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay will change the quantity prescribed under number 2 according to the extent of Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall take into account the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion mentioned under number 5 .
the total quantity mentioned in number 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the community on 5 800 tonnes of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ b@@ skin on the community market within agreed quantities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions , so that the sale of intervention stocks on frozen meat is not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the regulation the sale of Urugu@@ ay@@ an conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of ref@@ unds or other support measures for the export of lamb and lamb meat as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lambs only takes place at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products .
these terms are interpreted in a manner compatible with article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement .
Uruguay ensures compliance with this agreement , in particular by the fact that within the quantities specified in this agreement , it is granted export lic@@ ences for the products listed under the number 1 .
the community , in its turn , ple@@ dges to meet all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned products originates from the presentation of a export license which is given by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
in terms of implementation , the competent ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community , in regular intervals , communic@@ ates the quantities for which export lic@@ ences have been issued ; these data may , if necessary , en@@ code to destination country .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Ö@@ st@@ lich of Uruguay on the other .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing within a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this Agreement shall be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government with this letter .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another substance given on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured twice in a suitable medium by dil@@ uting the re@@ agent to be examined .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated solely by volume of blood cell in@@ undation in the total volume .
in Anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on slides , activity is expressed through time needed for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has established international standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are elabor@@ ated at the time .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for the blood group identification of most speci@@ f@@ ties is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating sti@@ ffer , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group identification , available for international standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as complete anti @-@ D ) can be expressed on the basis of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison to the International standard preparation or a state standard preparation in international units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ ers contain according to definition 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory of Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen .

if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents based on the label is based on the results of the durability test ; it must be approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no humidity can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose a maximum of 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ ous pent@@ oxi@@ des in a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic is added to the agent ( or the solution supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group identification must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml liquid or re@@ resolved serum .
the re@@ agents , regardless of whether in liquid form or after re@@ activation , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments nor particles or visible particles .
the re@@ agents for the international exchange of blood group identification should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least until an international agreement reached a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer laboratory has written records of all stages of production and checks of the re@@ agents for the determination of blood groups .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents issued can be stored for so long from the laboratory , until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for the blood group identification can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective component in three groups .
this does not mean that the agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or plant agents cannot contain any substances of human origin .
on each individual container is a black on white printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
