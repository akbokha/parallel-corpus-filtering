<seg id="730">(GRÜNDE - a) The EWG decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is hampered by general resource transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States shall be bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement and, as far as possible, be issued within two years of entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">(D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the central bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the organization of the EEC has presented a table that is visible in which way it intends to apply the criteria laid down in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The Organization establishes a special account under the name "Special transaction account," which consists of the funds that the member states contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this agreement; this account is managed by the organization as "steward" (in this property the organization is referred to as "steward"), and only to the purpose specified in this agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) The payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest notes of the member state, which must be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state at the order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the deposit point of the organization in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment is made in two instalments (i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the order within 30 days of entry into force of this Agreement or to any other between the EEC and the administrator at the appointed time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the balance sheet as of January 1, 1979 or at another time agreed between the EEC and the Administrator, taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may be able to make payments before the above dates on request.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator takes approximately proportional strokes to the cash or the school eye to cover expenses for the special transaction loan and balance the special transaction account in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the granting of these loans, the caretaker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">The extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and foreseeable economic problems of the country;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) of the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its other lending capacity to loan conditions without perks; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) The extent to which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Any special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly expandable development program or project (including a sectoral project), regardless of whether it is part of the organization's loan programme or not, according to the procedures and practices that are considered, approved and managed by the ordinary resources of the organization, whereby the objective of this agreement is to be taken into account under the b) preamble for this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special transaction account must not be used instead of regular means of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization, which is bound by a loan or credit scheme for a program or project, which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from section 4, special loans are subject to the same repayment terms, which are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the organization; thus, they are repayable in ten free years each in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts for payment of this clock are to be paid directly to the organization which it retains.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each special transaction loan is to be ascertained by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the origin of the funds is specifically stated.</seg>
<seg id="751">The proceeds from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services manufactured or provided in a Member State; ii) in developing countries, the members of the organization and who according to what the administrator has specified at the time of loan granted, could be a recipient of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account, and the amount paid back in the currency of a member state is to be transferred to the Member State as soon as possible after its receipt as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="753">The caretaker shall inform the EEC on the purpose and programs approved by the directors until the complete publication of all the reactive loans.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of payment of the special transaction loan, the Administrator informs the EEC about the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The caretaker communicates the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed statement of the transaction account with a statement from the external Auditor of the Organisation to this account statement.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator of the EEC soon conveys a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and conducts appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts paid from the account to the account received and from the account paid out from the account and the repayments to the Member States are visible.</seg>
