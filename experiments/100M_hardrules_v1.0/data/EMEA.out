this document is a summary of the European Public assessment report ( EP@@ AR ) in which it explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the packaging supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendation , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. Int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual thinking and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness , in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of anor@@ ex@@ ic high spirits ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when the oral consumption of the medication is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used for inhal@@ ation or melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other drugs at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose should be adjusted by A@@ bili@@ fy .
this affects signal transmission between brain cells by means of &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is believed to be a &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter acts to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize brain activity , reducing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ r@@ ence .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the occurrence of symptoms was examined in three studies lasting up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies of 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased anxiety over a period of two hours compared to a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence , to 160 patients in which the symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest with which by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
all studies examined the change in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution for taking into account ( absor@@ bs ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly more rest@@ less than patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
in four of the five short @-@ term studies , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than plac@@ ebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
in addition , A@@ bili@@ fy prevented up to 74 weeks of effective plac@@ ebo for the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also decreased more effectively than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common A@@ bili@@ fy side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ amid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled tick ) , nausea , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , headache , blur@@ red vision , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( increased s@@ ali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with predominantly man@@ ic episodes , predomin@@ ated in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
furthermore , the Committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. for placing A@@ bili@@ fy on the whole of the European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes were responding to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals .
an increased efficacy in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , independent of the meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
considering the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , even in case of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , conduc@@ tion disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including cel@@ eri@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ien : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
if there is signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia in a patient treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , it should be considered to reduce the dose or break down treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , had an increased risk of ster@@ ility compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sis , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side effects , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ ers , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically important .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
for C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ ab@@ a@@ vers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabolism agents .
considering the common administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be carried out .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose level before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or es@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no significant effect on the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ sm of the substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ morph@@ ine / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ met@@ morph@@ ine ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
this drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the insufficient data layer for safety in humans and because of the concerns caused in the reproductive studies of the animal , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , a total of lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia compared to patients treated with Hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ yst@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS amounted to 23.@@ 5 % in patients with catar@@ act treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with cervi@@ cal treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term development phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , in general temporarily and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects associated with anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy are the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l have been observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dosing with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is useful in the treatment of over@@ dosing , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma penetration .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial ag@@ agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and D3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to the alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks in healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the Put@@ amen .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ dents who had adher@@ ed to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher return rate of 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % in plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ yst@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational dual @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients increased weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a efficacy in week 3 versus plac@@ ebo , which was comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable share of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks for man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed himself superior to plac@@ ebo in regard to the prevention of bi@@ polar residues , mainly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for stretching and hydro@@ xy@@ elling of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean time of elimination is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l for extensive metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ ab@@ sin@@ ers via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a population @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not indicate clin@@ ically significant differences regarding eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no significance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment Acc@@ um@@ ulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al rin@@ ds @-@ aden@@ omas / carcin@@ omas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the mean ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ g@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16 to 8 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 .
however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the bile of apes , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solution .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ien : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial ag@@ agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS amounted to 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial ag@@ agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ yst@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational dual @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients increased weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) .
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l as a solution for taking 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Moreover , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ g@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16 to 8 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used for quick control of ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be terminated and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ise the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deeply into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended in the circum@@ vention of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status under consideration of the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if an additional oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the features of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy melt tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with a@@ toxic@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were otherwise caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with extreme sedi@@ ment or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients suffering from alcohol or drug toxic@@ ity ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , conduc@@ tion disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including cel@@ eri@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing consciousness layers and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , per@@ spir@@ ation and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sis , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ gregation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) was administered in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly and which at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ ers , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically important .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ ab@@ a@@ vers can result in common use with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and should therefore be carried out similar can reductions .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose level before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
if 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) received in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following adverse events were more common in clinical studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 : the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified in clinical trials with oral an@@ al@@ om@@ yel@@ ia as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with catar@@ act treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in plac@@ ebo patients .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term development phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , in general temporarily and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects associated with anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy are the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders were the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of ag@@ gi@@ ti@@ ghtness / behavi@@ our@@ al problems compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms regarding det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed mean improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score for the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe det@@ achment , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be observed due to decreased patient number .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ dents who had adher@@ ed to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher return rate of 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ sc@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational dual @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks involving 3@@ 14 patients and the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) occurred in significantly fewer patients .
111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed himself superior to plac@@ ebo in regard to the prevention of bi@@ polar residues , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % bigger in the first 2 hours after in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time was applied until reaching the maximum plasma level in 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15 or 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular .
in studies on the toxic@@ ity toxic@@ ity of intraven@@ ous applications , there was no safety concern about mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not reveal any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans ; therefore they have limited or no significance for the clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment Acc@@ um@@ ulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al @-@ adren@@ al aden@@ omas / carcin@@ omas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ g@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16 to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dosage , which resulted in ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which three quarters had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medication .
only those patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer were not able to make any difference in the effects of efficacy indicators such as time to wor@@ sen@@ ing disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer were shown in terms of these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients with whom the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and that it does not have to be given to other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not indicated ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ al number &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in the case of sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy , the treatment must be interrupted until an improvement is reached in grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of the kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nano @-@ artic@@ ulated formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
no additional Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated in the patients until the number of neut@@ ro@@ sters rose again &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the number of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes increased again &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was un@@ proven in connection with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac events in the indicated patients range are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if nausea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ ho@@ ea occur in patients after the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual medications and con@@ sti@@ lling methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should consult a barrier service before treatment , as the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very often ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the transport capacity and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most prominent hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
side effects listed in Table 1 are the side effects that have been associated with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in context in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimate of the actual incidence is possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an an@@ tim@@ i@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules substance that promotes the ag@@ gregation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ a and stabili@@ ses mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation results in an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ oc@@ y@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the context of in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ um@@ eric receptor and occurs due to the alb@@ um@@ in protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumor .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ armed un@@ f@@ aded studies and of 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ entre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ cation ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general state ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree of patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ic degree 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for decay to bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the exposure level exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or soft connection of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after a solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative precip@@ itation of the unchanged active substance was 4 % of the total dose with less than 1 % of the total met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
however , only a few data are available to patients at the age of 75 , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected against light light over 8 hours .

member states must ensure that the holder of approval for placing on the market provides the medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials before the market launch :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging inserts . • With a clear image of the correct application of the product , cold storage boxes for transport through the patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that it is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood cancers , in which complications may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if there is no blood donation before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml can be expected .
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ y@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection may also be performed by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided they have received appropriate instructions .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency , or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell containing a gene ( DNA ) that enables it to form epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
ab@@ se@@ amed was compared as an injection into a v@@ ein in a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , compared with the reference drug .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o into a v@@ ein before they were either switched to Ab@@ y@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of ab@@ ec@@ amed under the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who suffered an an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to ab@@ ec@@ amed were maintained in the same degree as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally leads to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
ab@@ se@@ amed must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
un@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for ab@@ sent@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that makes Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for placing Ab@@ se@@ amed in the European Union .

treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in case of planned larger surgical procedures requiring a large blood volume substitute ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ y@@ amed can be used in adults with no iron deficiency , where a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml that cannot participate in a aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients in which the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should lie .
symptoms of an@@ emia and disease may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , it is necessary to assess the individual clinical course and condition of disease by the doctor .
a rise in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels can occasionally be observed in a patient over or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa dosage is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is used at the lowest approved dose , which is required to control an@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the clinical results suggest that patients with a very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results suggest that patients with a very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by an intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the patient &apos;s evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition is required by the doctor .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is used at the lowest approved dose , which is required for controlling the symptoms of an@@ emia .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te Num@@ bers by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be retained 150 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l has increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value has increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained three times a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to the epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood cann@@ ons is required , should receive ab@@ se@@ amed at a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should begin as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program , so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the abor@@ tion therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days before , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine into circulation .
patients who suffer from the treatment with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n at er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive any ab@@ ec@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
the application of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients with a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral vascular disease , vascular disease of the oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n .
in patients with sudden loss of action defined as a reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the common causes of failure ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium toxic@@ ity , infection or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are studied .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes &quot; index &quot; ) , is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ yte numbers are normal , and if no other reason of an effective loss is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row to diagnose a PR@@ CA .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
in clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events was observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit attributed to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the symptoms of an@@ emia and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
the findings of an@@ a@@ emia associated with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , do not accelerate the progression of kidney failure .
in the case of tumour patients receiving chemotherapy , epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa should be considered a 2 - 3 week delay between epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa and the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with paragraph 4.2 in order to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - Dos@@ age adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are fores@@ een for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure , if possible , before starting the epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients undergoing greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular diseases , especially with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in the case of treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa for patients with an initial hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl , an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic / vascular events may exist .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ eti@@ ins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumor patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ emia , or decrease the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
when Epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to increasing ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no indication of an interaction between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
over th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accidents , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , retinal thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n treatment , so also patients under epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the wor@@ sen@@ ing of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can cause th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations .
the genetic algorithm @-@ derived epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and is identical with the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ aesthetic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa specifically stimulates er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ cop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and progression were studied in five large controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n were consistent with an an@@ a@@ emia due to various common malign@@ an@@ cies , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality than in the controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications associated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n treated patients and at controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n in tumor patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as few patients with these characteristics were included in the examined data .
epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa regulations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first administration or 24 hours after the last administration .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and might be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated three years with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
14 In animal studies with approximately the 20@@ ples of the weekly dose recommended for humans , epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa led to decreased federal body weight , to a delay of the oscill@@ ation and to an increase of fet@@ al mortality .
these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumour tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

• If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke within a month before your treatment , if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or increased chest pain ) , the risk of drop@@ let formation in veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) occurs - if , for example , previously such a blood cl@@ an has occurred .
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral vascular disease of the oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) , you recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets can occur within the normal range .
your doctor will conduct regular blood tests if necessary to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , dissolution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , loss of blood , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency should be considered and treated with path@@ ways before the treatment begins .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n was reported very rarely over the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a after mon@@ g@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( sub@@ cut@@ aneous ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a , it will termin@@ ate your therapy with abor@@ tion and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , abor@@ tion must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value may cause the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death can be increased .
in case of increased or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may consider an interruption of the treatment with abor@@ tion until the potassium levels are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically exposed cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion sign due to insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the findings present , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa dosing and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the efficacy of ab@@ se@@ amed .
your doctor will regularly determine your red blood dy@@ es ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your dose accordingly to keep the risk of blood cl@@ umping ( th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
if you &apos;re a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed acts as a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative impact on the tumour under certain circumstances .
if you have a larger orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , you should check the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia before the start of treatment and be treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive ab@@ ec@@ amed because there is an increased risk of drop@@ let formation after the surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are using / applying other medications or recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may need to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory investigations have not shown any interaction between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of building up the immune system , such as cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia ( an@@ a@@ emia ) respon@@ ds to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works properly and does not exceed your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value .
once you are well tuned , you will receive regular doses of ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed to two equally large inj@@ ections .

Ac@@ last@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ tures ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered a low traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture as at the stroke ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of the bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; before the first in@@ fusion patients should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ last@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ last@@ a .
the first study included nearly 8@@ ,000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures has been studied over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a was tested in two studies of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) again norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the plac@@ ebo patients .
in comparison with all patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under Ac@@ last@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ last@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ last@@ a must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ last@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion area and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( loss of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ last@@ a provides information for doctors who prescri@@ be ac@@ last@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information about how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for the launch of Ac@@ last@@ a in the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • Con@@ trac@@ tual indications in pregnancy and in nursing women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance
oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg ac@@ last@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Pa@@ get with Ac@@ last@@ a , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure a sufficient intake of calcium for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ last@@ a in@@ fusion .
the incidence of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol can be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and teenagers Ac@@ last@@ a are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data on safety and efficacy are missing .
Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended for patients with severe kidney failure ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before the treatment begins with Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid insertion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone conversion , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure a sufficient intake of calcium for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be examined before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive denti@@ stry .
no data is available for patients need@@ ing dental intervention , if the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw area .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the incidence of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen can be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of cases reported as serious side effects of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to those receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ last@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in table 1 .
kidney Dys@@ function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron A@@ ci@@ d was associated with kidney function disorders that have been associated as a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as impaired ren@@ al function were in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a versus 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , showed up at 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get @-@ studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study on the prevention of clinical frac@@ tures after a frac@@ ture frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on the prevention of clinical frac@@ tures after a l@@ itt@@ oral frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study were reported about local reactions to the in@@ fusion area , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the max@@ il@@ lo@@ facial surgery were reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention .
7 study of 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area in a patient treated with plac@@ ebo .
in the event of an over@@ dose leading to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by means of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ last@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without any signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric spinal frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a were significantly reduced over a period of three years and the frequency of one or more new ed@@ dy body frac@@ tures after one year ( see table 2 ) .
ac@@ last@@ a @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a showed an equally lasting effect over three years , resulting in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for hip frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ last@@ a significantly increased bone density on lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the h@@ emisph@@ ere by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In 152 post @-@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) , bone biop@@ sies were taken from the pel@@ vis a year after the third annual dose .
in comparison to plac@@ ebo , a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ecular ar@@ bone volume and the preservation of the tr@@ ab@@ ecular ar@@ bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study time .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ last@@ a reduced B@@ SAP significantly by 30 % after 12 months compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ last@@ a compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , in comparison to plac@@ ebo treatment the BM@@ D increased the BM@@ D at the overall shr@@ ink@@ age and shr@@ ink@@ age at all points of time .
the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment led to an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.4 % compared to plac@@ ebo treatment at 5.@@ 4 % of the total shr@@ ink@@ age and 4.3 % at the plac@@ ebo arm .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , 5@@ 08 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in men treated with acet@@ oni@@ as compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( Study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ yearly administration of acet@@ oni@@ on@@ ate in relation to the weekly dosing of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ last@@ a was studied in patients and patients at the age of 30 with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly light to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the age @-@ specific upper normal value when taken into the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six month comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease of pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ last@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month trial could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with Ac@@ last@@ a and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response at 141 of those patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate could be maintained at a mean duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients revealed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that , the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h followed by a long period of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ -@@ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ -@@ 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elim@@ inations cycle time t ½ g 146 hours .
the early stages of distribution ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion through the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the total body clearance is 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains unaffected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a reduced clearance of metaboli@@ zed by Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in an easy ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function disorder up to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid required .
as for severe kidney function interference ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest intraven@@ ous IV single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg body weight and in rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in the case of trials on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous use , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was administered in rats using doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dosage equivalent to the 7@@ fold of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure to the AU@@ C , equivalent to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated exposure to cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions that exceed the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , and intraven@@ ous inj@@ ections were performed .
the most common finding in recur@@ rent studies was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an inf@@ estation , which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in doses from 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum levels of serum .

according to the CH@@ MP Directive for Risk Management Systems for Human Use , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements on safety , pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been achieved . • On request from the E@@ MEA .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a sub @-@ class agent called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , above all est@@ ro@@ gens made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the Pa@@ get , bone conversion is done too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ last@@ a works by norm@@ alizing bone conversion , ensuring normal bone formation , giving strength to the bone again .
if you are in dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ last@@ a .
when using Ac@@ last@@ a with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you are using / applying other medicines or recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription medicine .
for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are taking medicine that is known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ last@@ a together with food and drink , you are concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you will have enough liquid before and after the treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
since Ac@@ last@@ a works for a long time , you may need to take another dose after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a has been missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before ending the therapy with Ac@@ last@@ a Falls , consider the termination of the treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a .
currently it is not clear if Ac@@ last@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received Ac@@ last@@ a .
physical signs because of a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b@@ ness , especially in the area around the mouth .

please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the side effects you mentioned are significantly impaired or you notice any side effects not listed in this use information .
if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
in patients with a recently l@@ itt@@ led low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture it is recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a patients must be adequately supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important for patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid insertion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone conversion , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atically ver@@ gent , hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , accordingly at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ last@@ a .
in patients with a recently l@@ itt@@ led low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the packaging supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
A@@ compli@@ a is used in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , who suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or over or • which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more
in addition , four studies were carried out to over 7 000 patients in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for setting the smoking .
on the other hand , the studies on setting the smoking did not show consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ compli@@ a was difficult to assess in this field of application .
which risk is associated with A@@ compli@@ a ? he The most common side effects of A@@ compli@@ a that were observed during studies ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and infections of upper respiratory tissues .
it may not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants as it may increase the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among others in a small minority of patients .
caution is advisable with simultaneous use of drugs such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a means of applying HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . LN
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ compli@@ a in terms of reducing weight in patients with obesity or obes@@ e patients
used in patients who require it for health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing information packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the ar@@ z
in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or obes@@ e patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors like type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ d@@ emia ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ compli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to lack of data on efficacy and safety .
depression or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of treatment in an individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
also in patients who - besides obesity - do not have any visible risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other related persons should point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms occur . l@@ n
• El@@ derly patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown adequately .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public assessment report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated . • It can be used together with another diabetes medicine ( dual therapy ) .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) that cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ ide or insulin , the current dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ ur@@ ic substance or insulin can be retained with the beginning of the acet@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) , where the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , which makes type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of acet@@ one in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ anine , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which indicates that the blood sugar levels were lowered in the application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic substance showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of plac@@ ebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who also took plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with ac@@ tos were visual disorders , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ aes@@ thesia ( reduced sensitivity to stim@@ uli ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one mirrors - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that , as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in , Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in which met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for placing an account in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and wear on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
there are no data available for the application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
for patients who are at risk of having at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) to develop a de@@ compensated heart failure , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
cardiovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under the age of 75 with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease has been performed .
this study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that refer to h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , abdominal discomfort , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked .
the decision as to whether the treatment of patients with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one continued , should be directed to the safety of the laboratory parameters from clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which can derive from fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention .
as a result of a h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , a small reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ oth by 3.1 % and insulin ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ oth by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral dual or triple combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , a decrease in visual acuity was reported under the treatment of thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , an incidence or deterioration of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but con@@ cor@@ dant doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report about disturbances of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the refrac@@ tive frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active trial , a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is to be canc@@ eled ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not ex@@ ert any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker , and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduction inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one decreases the hyper@@ insulin resistance resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother &apos;s animal , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not available from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ ret and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one AL@@ T asc@@ ents over three times the upper limit of the normal range were equally common as in plac@@ ebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins .
in an outcome study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
since the market launch it has rarely been reported about heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , but more often if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the treated groups treated with plac@@ ebo .
compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on were treated in a trial period of 3.5 years , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms oc@@ cured .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome prolifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) , leading to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ lin@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect was completed ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of three months of optimization with insulin was random@@ ized to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical studies over a year a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabe@@ tics for 18 weeks .
in most clinical trials , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction in overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as in@@ significant , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced the overall plas@@ mat@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or bile .
in comparison to plac@@ ebo , a statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was found under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , while lower levels of met@@ form@@ in and ci@@ li@@ cide were observed .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only reduced the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , both on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active trial , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ized in groups that received either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ modified Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma usually reach 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to the effectiveness is roughly three times the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ elimination duration of unchanged pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of the oral clearance of the parent substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance in the uter@@ us , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um was induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to an increased incidence of col@@ onic tum@@ ours .

the refrac@@ tive frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active trial , a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study over two years the effects of combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were examined with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide .
in clinical studies over 1 year a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to the initial values .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only reduced the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study lack@@ ed the aim of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not involve cardiovascular long @-@ term risks .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels have been lowered similar to other human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane doses may also be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( see the full list of packages ) .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ adem@@ ics out@@ weigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued an approval for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the launch of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily , if a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly , for example , by an intensified insulin therapy , can perceive hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type of insulin ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage .
if a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
prior to travelling , passing over several time zones , the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals being used or taken at other times .
the physician must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines they have taken .
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ controlled di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can , however , be gradually developed : • Heal@@ thy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , cand@@ y , bis@@ cuits or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven help person or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum working time is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration of action is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The Res@@ or@@ ption Profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with rapid res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of circuit ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the split is active .

do not use the remaining scale to measure your insulin dose • You will hear a click noise for each unit individually set .
take the injection technique that your doctor has shown to you . enter the dose by pressing the button in the right way ( Figure 3 ) .
the dosage pin must remain below the skin for at least 6 seconds after injection , to ensure that the full insulin dose is inj@@ ected at least 6 seconds to ensure that the dose regulator has to be reset to zero , since the dose regulator has to be reset to zero if you press the injection needle after the injection .
medical staff , family members as well as other assistants must observe general precau@@ tions for the removal and disposal of injection need@@ les in order to avoid accidental stit@@ ches with the injection needle .

this document is a summary of the European Public assessment report ( EP@@ AR ) in which it explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
the medicinal effective component of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced using the method of the so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology . &quot;

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other ingredients .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may need to be adjusted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued an approval for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the launch of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin has to be absorbed first , followed by the amount of insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
prior to travelling , passing over several time zones , the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals being used or taken at other times .
5 General disorders and complaints at the administration of the administration - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ emat@@ oma occur at the injection site ) .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients undergoing greater surgical procedures has shown that an intraven@@ ous hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum working time is achieved within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration of action is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data are limited but suggest that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .
in@@ fusion systems with Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in concentrations 0.@@ 05 I.@@ U. / ml - 1.0 I.@@ U. / ml insulin human in in@@ fusion liquid fluids 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D glucose and 10 % D- glucose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable at room temperature for 24 hours at room temperature .

always set the closing cap of your Nov@@ o@@ Let &apos;s finished p@@ ens when it is not in use to protect it from light .
dis@@ inf@@ ect the rubber membrane with a medical t@@ amp@@ on • Use a new injection needle for each injection to avoid contamination . • Remove the protective flap straight and firmly on Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Figure A ) • pull the large outer cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
follow these steps to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle upwards • Take a few times with your finger against the cartridge .
when air bubbles are present , they will gather in the cartridge at the top • Whi@@ le you continue the injection needle upward , turn the cartridge around one click in the direction of the arrow ( Figure B ) • Whi@@ le the injection needle continues upwards , press the push button in it ( Figure C ) • Now , a drop of insulin must be removed from the tip of the injection needle .
• Connect the cap back to the ready @-@ made pen so that the digit 0 is in front of the feeder name ( Figure D ) • Check if the button is pressed completely .
if the push button is not able to move freely , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the cap displays 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the pus@@ h@@ button moves out@@ wards while you turn the cap • The scale below the pus@@ h@@ button ( pus@@ h@@ button scale ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
• Add the highest number you can see on the pus@@ h@@ button • Add the two numbers to get the set dose • If you have set a wrong dose , simply turn the cap forward or backward until you have set the correct number of units .
turn it until the push button is located at the bottom and you can feel a resist@@ or . then remove the cap and set it up again that the 0 of the dosing stamp is opposite .
make sure to press the push button only during the injection • Ke@@ ep the button pressed after the injection , until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of crystal de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ out ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger pri@@ at@@ ric deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
g@@ out attacks can still occur during the first treatment months ; therefore , it is recommended that patients with Aden@@ ur@@ ic still have other medicines to prevent rheum@@ atic sei@@ zur@@ es during the first six months .
the drug is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not investigated for these groups .
in the first study that took part in 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with that of a plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ medication ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of 80 mg once a day , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who took 120 mg once a day , had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was the case with 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diarr@@ hea , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with heart problems in the pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also have a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to pri@@ mal deposits ( including a medical history known or currently present ) and / or rheum@@ atic arthritis ) .
if the serum acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x may be considered daily .
in patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents , as there are no experiences in children and adolescents , is not recommended to use f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients .
organ transplan@@ t recipients Sin@@ ce there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , treatment with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ seed treatments , it may result in an acute attack during the treatment process , because by lowering the serum resin acid level , ur@@ ic acid deposits can initially be mobili@@ sed in the tissue .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine is so widespread in rare cases that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver diseases Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials , light ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before the start of the f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ uses and in the course of the course ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line tin was not performed any interaction studies on f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition leads to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( an in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous administration of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ ine or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time .
in a study with subjects 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at to the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that con@@ current consumption of an ant@@ acid containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , slow@@ ing absorption of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies do not include side effects of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operation of machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the total f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relationship with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .

7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients treated with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 4 years .
the treatment @-@ related events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients receiving f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patients years ) , according to the indications occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :
diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hyp@@ es@@ thesia , eye @-@ catching , skin dis@@ col@@ oration , skin l@@ esi@@ on , bur@@ si@@ tis , protein ur@@ ie , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , erectile dysfunction , increase in potassium concentration in the blood , decrease of TS@@ H concentration in the blood , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , decrease in the number of white blood cells .
the mode of action of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ in@@ metaboli@@ sm in humans and arises as part of the reaction as@@ k@@ ade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX Study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum levels of serum were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg / dl or 100 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine value at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with commonly used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the reduction in serum hardness levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and kept permanently throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cre@@ at@@ ins &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( ie .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of serum suppl@@ em@@ ental acid concentrations in subjects , not@@ withstanding their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum suppl@@ em@@ ental acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum suppl@@ em@@ entation of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data of the open extension study phase 3 in two years showed that the reduction in serum levels of serum was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 needed a treatment against g@@ lowing ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment for a g@@ lowing ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the lymp@@ h nodes up to month 24 .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ W / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at were administered in a simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ ed propor@@ tionally .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg a rise in the AU@@ C is observed for f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ max amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in serum suppl@@ em@@ ental acid concentration was observed if this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding of alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width that is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es , these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are predominantly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is primarily produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 , and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as unchanged f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as unchanged f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function .
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased about 1.8 times from 7.5 μ g / h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / h / ml in a group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) Li@@ ver function restriction , the C@@ max and AU@@ C of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at changed significantly in comparison to subjects with normal liver function .
age No significant changes were observed with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after intake of multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase in ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ors ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with x@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed group , with approximately 11 times the exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metaboli@@ zation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were about 4 x 3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , which accompanied by a reduction in the capacity and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and with carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which were approximately 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , did not have ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , in which there is a risk for a small vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down until after the first meal of the day , which is to take 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already being used separately from each other in medicines approved in the European Union , the company presented data origin@@ ating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who only received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , block@@ age , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( ul@@ cer@@ ation ) , cereb@@ ral ab@@ norm@@ alities ( swal@@ lowing disorders ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en and sour upset .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any of the other components .
it must not be used in cases of o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who cannot stand upright or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd. company for placing AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the European Union .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following po@@ inters are to be followed closely to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day of the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or let the tablet dissolve in the mouth as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not sit down before the first meal of the day , which is to take 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B . pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , should only be given special care ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al lines , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
therefore , the doctor should pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible bad reactions , and patients should be pointed out , in the occurrence of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ star@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , were rarely reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ mens include intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available to indicate whether the treatment of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients need@@ ing a surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet next morning when consuming a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but take one tablet a week as originally planned for the planned day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before starting therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time .
patients must therefore wait at least 30 minutes after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies have not been conducted , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions occurring .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for the application of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy that recognize embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports stem from cancer patients , but also oste@@ opor@@ osis was reported .
however , decreases in serum levels up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were observed in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ing an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or Ul@@ zer@@ a .

in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day for five days ) did not result in any clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 Distribution of rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly circul@@ ated into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ eces .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and the systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the elimination of other medicines by these transport systems .

in the liver , bio@@ degradation of vitamin D3 is quickly hydro@@ xy@@ lic in the liver and then metaboli@@ zed in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 , the bi@@ ologically active form .
ex@@ cre@@ tion In the application of radio@@ actively mar@@ inated vitamin D3 to healthy volunteers , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in rot@@ ting after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics of patients with pre @-@ clinical studies have shown that the share of alpha @-@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted over the urine .
although no clinical data is available , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal tests can also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , an increased accumulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in bone is expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

advoc@@ ate is administered to adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted to kidney or liver in order to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation , comparing the application of Adv@@ agra@@ ph with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment duration of one year ( by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were carried out and examined , as Adv@@ agra@@ ph is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

patients and doctors need to be careful if others ( especially some herbal ) drugs are taken at the same time with advance , as the advance dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can result in transplan@@ t rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; reform@@ ations of the formulation or regime should only be performed under the narrow @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of a switch to an alternative formulation , therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dose of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ agra@@ ph &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level provisions ( see below &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Valley levels should be controlled before switching over and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 the systemic exposure measured as a valley mirror , with both form@@ ulations , was comparable to both ni@@ er@@ - and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ king are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Adv@@ agra@@ ph to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t period .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ clear@@ ance substance , an adaptation of the advance dos@@ sier may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow a oral ing@@ es@@ tion of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment may be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained in order to supp@@ ress the transplan@@ t rejection ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot therefore be given .
dose recommendations - kidney transplantation pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The or@@ ale advance therapy should begin at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments may later be necessary , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplantation pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The or@@ ale advance therapy should begin at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph must be converted to a transplan@@ t recipient of twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of advance , so this change@@ over has to take place in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .
after a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs to advance , the treatment must begin with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection .
cardiac transplantation In adult patients who are switched to advance , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience in lung , pancre@@ atic and bow@@ el transplan@@ t patients , had a oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , for pancre@@ atic transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day , and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with impaired liver function In order to maintain blood levels in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
patients with impaired ren@@ al function Sin@@ ce the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular definition of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ol and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ ph When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases using full blood tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low controls .
it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ king during the first two weeks following transplan@@ t followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ king of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to advance , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ ph is a medicine with a low clearance , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the level of seb@@ um in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood in the first time after liver transplantation are usually in the range from 5 - 20 ng / ml and for kidney and heart transplan@@ t patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during subsequent maintenance of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the area of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; reform@@ ations of the formulation or regime should only be performed under the narrow @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 In the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy @-@ resistant against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ ph are still present .
for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplantation recipients , no clinical data are yet available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Advent .
because of possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant remedies should be avoided during a treatment with advance ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels is offered in the blood , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances .
in rare cases a hyper@@ tro@@ phy called cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid over@@ load and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or ultra@@ violet light should be limited due to the potential risk of mal@@ ig@@ ned skin l@@ esi@@ ons due to suitable clothing or use of a solar control with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered states of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and blur@@ red vision , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
as advoc@@ ate hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose contain , special caution is offered in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore advisable to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Blood Mir@@ ror at the same time as a gift of substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain even concentrations accordingly ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong interaction has been achieved with an@@ tim@@ y@@ co@@ tics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ id antibiotic er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the rise in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
high dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may affect their metabolism .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the level of hormone exposure , it is particularly cau@@ tious in decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal tests have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus may potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the new@@ born to possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) is recommended .
there is a risk of premature birth ( &lt; Week 37 ) and a Hyper@@ kal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants can often not be determined precisely because of the patient &apos;s disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
the side effects after their frequency are listed in descending order : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10.000 , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .

mode of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ oli@@ tic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell inn@@ ards .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent suspension of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell , preventing the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ id genes .

175 lung transplan@@ ted patients , with 4@@ 75 patients undergoing a pancre@@ atic transplantation , and in 6@@ 30 cases were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant in 6@@ 30 cases .
overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to the observations of the large studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multic@@ enter study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
in the first year after the transplan@@ t , chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ative syndrome , was less frequently observed after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the incidence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans in 21.@@ 7 % was compared to 3@@ 8.0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients en@@ forced by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in a study , the frequency of the gen@@ esis of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ative syndrome was significantly lower in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pancre@@ as Transplan@@ tation A multic@@ entre study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted to 205 patients who were simultaneously undergoing a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation undergoing a random@@ ised procedure Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ dose ( by protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the desired level of seb@@ um from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
col@@ on transplantation The published clinical results of a mon@@ oc@@ entri@@ c study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after intestinal transplan@@ ts showed a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations which lead to an increase in the missing faction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by the treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion takes place mainly via the bile .
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ ph was approximately 10 % lower than Pro@@ gra@@ f in case of stable patients treated by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) at a rate of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) .

advoc@@ ates are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether advoc@@ ates are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced using a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that enables it to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advoc@@ ate is similar to another drug called re@@ bin@@ ate , which is approved in the European Union , but is made differently , so that the drug does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of implants in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ als was &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies vis @-@ à @-@ vis factor VI@@ II .
advoc@@ ates may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of Adv@@ oc@@ ate in the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , the place and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not drop below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ U. / dl ) during the corresponding period .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
repeat all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) , until the risk is over for the patient .
during the course of treatment , the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections are recommended to control the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , different in vivo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg of body weight should be given at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not achieved or if the bleeding with an appropriate dose is not ma@@ stered , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the administration speed should be directed to the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against Factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VI@@ II immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , where the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 Ex@@ posi@@ tional days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tic @-@ known inhibit@@ ors development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ r@@ ence of ( low @-@ ti@@ pped ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
because of the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences about applying Factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of inhibit@@ ing inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) The unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed adequate levels of value on the 15 postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE an 145 children and adults 2 diagnosed with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) showed only one patient after 26 ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ ATE a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , no 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years of age and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) were detected by prior exposure to factor VI@@ II concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) an F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients an ongoing clinical trial consisted of 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of the anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes was reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the scope of the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products A@@ DV@@ ATE has reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated Factor VI@@ II acts as a co @-@ actor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated Factor X from Factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed to pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( base value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .

based on the data available since initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP on the basis of the A@@ DV@@ ATE safety profile , which makes a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for further extensions over the next 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited approved the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company withdraw@@ s its application for authorisation for the marketing of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that connects , surrounds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ oc@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified so that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus can cause no infection in humans .
Adv@@ oc@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , allowing the cancer cells to re@@ build the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene present in the human body , usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored .
in case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can grow and share .
the company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of sub@@ construction , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP tested the company &apos;s answers to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP generates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ oc@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore has advantages for patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
furthermore , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ Ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who are in close contact with the patient .
the company did not know the CH@@ MP if the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs with Adv@@ exu@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , nas@@ al infections caused by allergy to poll@@ en ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and teenagers aged 12 or over , the recommended dose of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with or without food entirely with a glass of water .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be trac@@ ed to the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main impact measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , the patients recorded their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all ha@@ y symptoms except con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , the patients receiving aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who only received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c substances or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients suffering from a narrow @-@ angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dosis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) or a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the placing of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze on the whole of the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after symptoms of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days , as long @-@ term use can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper air@@ ways the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy .
since aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the drug is contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ id , tin oxide , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ gen@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a that are per@@ oral or nas@@ ally as ab@@ ov@@ aries of Rhin@@ ology ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient collective and the data does not suff@@ ice to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treating hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or intensi@@ fication of head@@ aches ) must be stopped .
patients with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder hol@@ dings or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions .
however , as part of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in vivo and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the safety of the use of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a presum@@ ption that may result in impair@@ ment of transport capacity or the ability to operate machinery .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mol@@ or , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ al processes .
headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ al pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
CN@@ S stimulation is most likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ il stiff@@ ness and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the suspension of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human body cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ hesi@@ ve molecule P sel@@ ector on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s took part , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine @-@ antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher compared to the overall results for the symptoms ( besides nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine during the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in patient sub @-@ groups with regard to gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the administration .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , it has been established that four volunteers underwent bad metabolism .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the exclusive gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was to exposure after gift of an aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not reveal any particular danger to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system described in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , to un@@ fold its effect .
aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and drow@@ ning or che@@ ering eyes while con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .

tell your doctor if the following symptoms or conditions occur or diagnosed with you under the use of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze : • High blood pressure • Heart ch@@ ase , pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and head@@ aches or strengthening existing head@@ aches .
if you are taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
use in the recommended dosage is not to be expected that aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze will lead to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness or the attention is reduced .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you forgot to take Aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the time appointed .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed are significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was reported very rarely about cases of severe allergic reactions ( respiratory , whi@@ stling breath , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin ras@@ hes .
about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart hunting , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diarr@@ hea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of inflammation of the liver and about cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg of ly@@ op@@ hili@@ c ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg and 5 mg fusion tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or 5 ml .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by identifying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rant , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance of the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to enter and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application of children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies have been taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average reduction in the scores ( scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous illness exp@@ ir@@ ation and may be terminated after the symptoms end and when re @-@ occur@@ ren@@ ces are resum@@ ed .
in case of persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients may be recommended during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can be assumed that it can lead to impair@@ ment of transport capacity or the ability to operate machinery .
clinical studies in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most commonly reported adverse events reported in plac@@ ebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study that was administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
this includes both the suspension of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human body cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ hesi@@ ve molecule P sel@@ ector on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses that were administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no longer an extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also be classified depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
as shown on the basis of the overall quality of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria has been studied for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , not@@ withstanding the eti@@ ology of different forms , is similar and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited simple pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since hist@@ am@@ inf@@ estation is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that in addition to chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n also leads to an improvement in symptoms even in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pre@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squ@@ ad@@ ls at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement of the itch by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in comparison to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which the patient demo@@ s were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ul@@ ating after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines will not be completely ruled out
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with a lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , rich and rich in calories ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular danger to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ ber should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metaboli@@ se Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience a higher substance weight ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years of age , which is fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical with that of children who metaboli@@ se normally .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study the effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sy@@ rup @-@ Group , similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 , who were eligible for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily total dose of 1,@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered over 14 days a day in a dosage of up to 20 mg .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ on@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no longer showed an extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day for adults and adolescents there was no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies did not interfere with psych@@ om@@ otor disorders .
clinical pharmac@@ ological studies of adults did not result in an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess due to the con@@ current consumption of alcohol either to ampli@@ fy alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment or increase drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the basis of the overall quality of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pre@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squ@@ ad@@ ls at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this constra@@ ined phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children aged 2 to 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are fully metaboli@@ zed .
the loading ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was approximately 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max for about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant drug accumulation after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were comparable in the recommended doses with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup is available in type III brown glass bottles with a child @-@ proof polypropylene seal with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt can be taken without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven yet .
the overall frequency of the side effects of the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and plac@@ ebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile detected in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , the A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet proved to be bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ c to the dec@@ lining formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years of age , which is fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical with that of children who metaboli@@ se normally .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take this medicine with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency .
the overall incidence of adverse events in children aged 2 to 11 was similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
in infants from 6 to 23 months , the most common adverse events reported were diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , at a one @-@ time intake of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no side effects were observed in patients between the ages of 6 and 11 .
at the recommended doses the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see below 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day for adults and adolescents there was no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can alternatively also occur in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms .
as shown on the basis of the overall quality of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. announced the official approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company withdraw@@ s its application for the launch of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new tribe of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from human to human because people have no immunity ( no protection ) on the other hand .
once the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the part of the flu virus in the vaccine as a &quot; foreign body &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
this means that the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies quicker in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane layer of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as foreign ) , was puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you would like to take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you would like further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendation , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the Human Immun@@ o@@ deficiency Virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) causing the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for intake , but it cannot be taken together with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined which an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus will respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase decreases the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines and keeps it at a low level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to cure AIDS , however , can delay damage to the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 infected adults who previously had not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the medicine A@@ gener@@ ase enhanced with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the alteration of viral load after treatment .
in studies with patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medicine A@@ gener@@ ase enhanced with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r decreased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as well as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the viral load after four weeks as in the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who use St. John &apos;s wort ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are broken down in the same way as A@@ gener@@ ase and are used in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , people who take A@@ gener@@ ase are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in body fat distribution ) , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors out@@ weigh the risks over four years .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee noted that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited an approval for the launch of A@@ gener@@ ase across the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years .
normally , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be given to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the increased addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver function disorders at 300 mg twice a day .
the simultaneous application should be taken with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic breadth and also represent the substrate of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 is@@ o@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r during the intake of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
normally , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy combination have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivi@@ ral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing h@@ ep@@ atic function including chronic hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ tical ero@@ i@@ der effects including Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determination of the drug concentration .
in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be supervised on om@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl @-@ ly@@ col@@ oration of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient populations .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 5 , if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or exac@@ er@@ bation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other diseases requiring medication to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B . higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it .
in hem@@ oly@@ tic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase of ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ emat@@ oma occur .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections may arise at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , leading to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms .
although a multi @-@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is adopted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher Body Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Sub@@ strate with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic breadth and also represent the substrate of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 is@@ o@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % shr@@ ink@@ age of the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to balance the degra@@ ded plasma levels by means of a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , unwanted effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already uses St. John &apos;s wort , the amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r@@ als are and , if possible , check the virus load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort .
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max however , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily to substanti@@ ate the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower if amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached in combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
dosage recommendations for simultaneous administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but it is recommended to be closely monitored , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the fantasy component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase lie at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in potentially lowers the serum concentration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs are to be used at the same time , caution is advisable because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be carried out as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in a rise in side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin should be at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data exists .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma around 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2,@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors , or induction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may cause interactions , if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase as it may lead to erectile dysfunction .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ant drugs known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ eli@@ pin , Nic@@ ola pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine and an@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased .
the simultaneous intake of ap@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and ampli@@ fy the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of test subjects , the fluor@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous dose of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced increases in plasma levels while administration of A@@ gener@@ ase is expected .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations until stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used together with oral m@@ yo@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while at the same time it is advisable to use par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with care .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3 to 4 @-@ fa@@ che .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be supervised on om@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation is currently available on how to adjust the amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r dose if amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous ap@@ ital@@ isation ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exceeds breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ne@@ sting in the uter@@ us to the end of the breast feeding time amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a decreased increase in the 12 body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely lead to a treatment interruption .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .

anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fet@@ al sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al adi@@ pose tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cc@@ ally fat accumulation .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated individuals who had been treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / ci@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stit@@ ching ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin ras@@ hes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of side effects ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory alterations ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were similar to those observed in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral G@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ phen@@ ols with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non infectious viral particles .
the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients with the currently approved fossi@@ ls / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treated treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations rarely were observed .
in sixteen out of 4@@ 34 anti @-@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure lasted until week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / L , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) with patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or insul@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 5@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced lik@@ el@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests .
clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or insul@@ ates .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four associated with reduced sensitivity to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remain generally preserved .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti @-@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients with which a Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( containing a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r at the start of treatment and another against ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) appear .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ep@@ ase @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a therapy is recommended to prevent the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations , which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the proof of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre@@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( Vir@@ us@@ load ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) either A@@ gener@@ ase ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alog@@ a ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ one ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ level threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was used twice a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg a day , and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice a day , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice a day .
no low dose was given at the same time ; the majority of previously untreated patients had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered when optimizing therapy with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to oral administration the mean duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
5@@ 08 % raised , for C@@ max on the other hand lowered by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decline in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was unaffected by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large distribution volume and an un@@ imped@@ ed penetration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r that represents the active portion , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval in dependence on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 need to be administered with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , results in a similar daily amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram @-@ basis .
also the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney function disorder should be low to the elimination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those who are reported to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas were encountered in male animals in dos@@ ages , which correspond to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
from the actual exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application , there was little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests that included bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in the clinical routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in clinical studies , neither during the administration of ap@@ gener@@ ase after the end of the treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at the age of 4 showed a high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in a systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including th@@ ym@@ us navigation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the increased addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be taken with caution in patients with weak or slight liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determination of the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 27 , if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % shr@@ ink@@ age of the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max however , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached in combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
dosage recommendations for simultaneous administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but it is recommended to be closely monitored , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be carried out as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose is advised , although no clinical data exists .
the serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ eli@@ pin , Nic@@ ola pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine and an@@ ap@@ am@@ il may be increased .
in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of test subjects , the fluor@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ne@@ sting in the uter@@ us to the end of the breast feeding time amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a decreased increase in body weight during the down@@ time .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ep@@ ase @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ dden &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be taken into account when optimizing therapy with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval in dependence on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 need to be administered with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a kidney function disorder should be small to the elimination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas were encountered in male animals in dos@@ ages , which correspond to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily administration of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ul@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
from the actual exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application , there was little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation test ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at the age of 4 showed a high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in fry the metabolism path@@ ways are not yet fully developed , so that amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years .
the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for recording was not covered either with PI pre@@ treated patients or with PI pre@@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since there is no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for det@@ ecting and low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl lac@@ tic content , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , in pregnant women , in patients with impaired liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
the simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these medicines and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z .
patients should be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determination of the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed permanently if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ oly@@ tic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase of ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ emat@@ oma occur .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % shr@@ ink@@ age of the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max however , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous ing@@ es@@ tion with ap@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and increase the associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is expected to significantly increase plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am following oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . as a result of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us on the contained propylene gly@@ col , it is not possible to apply for the intake ( see section 4.3 ) .
in milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exceeds breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ne@@ sting in the uter@@ us to the end of the breast feeding time amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a decreased increase in the 55 body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients with the currently approved fossi@@ ls / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treated treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations rarely were observed .
the early departure of a se@@ eding 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits , which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ dden &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be taken into account when optimizing therapy with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large cous@@ in volume as well as an un@@ imped@@ ed penetration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
in a systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including th@@ ym@@ us navigation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating delayed development .

your doctor will normally instruc@@ t you to apply A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect of A@@ gener@@ ase .
the use of A@@ gener@@ ase will be based on the individual viral resistance test performed by your doctor and your treatment history .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from one of the above conditions or taking any of the drugs mentioned above .
if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to rein@@ force the effect ( boost ) , make sure that you have carefully read the use information on Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r prior to the treatment .
there is also no sufficient information to recommend the use of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the efficiency of children aged 4 to 12 years or generally in patients under 50 kg of body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore it is important that you read the section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Take A@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you start taking A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you may need additional Factor VI@@ II to control the a@@ version of blood . − In patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , a re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat can occur .

this can include fat loss in the legs , arms and face , fat gain on the abdom@@ en and in other inner organs , breast enlargement , and fat tum@@ ours in the neck ( &quot; stit@@ ching &quot; ) .
other ingredients are propylene gly@@ col , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ( polyethylene gly@@ col 400 ) , acet@@ ul@@ f@@ am potassium , su@@ c@@ ine sodium , sodium chlori@@ de , artificial ch@@ ewing gum , sodium cit@@ rate , cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ rate di@@ hydr@@ ate , puri@@ fied water .
the application frequency and the duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • For up to a maximum of 16 weeks , the cream is to be applied five times a week in case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
before bed@@ time , apply the cream to the affected areas of the skin , so that it stays on the skin sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same cream , but without the active substance ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the plac@@ ebo were performed either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of patients in the genital area , the complete healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in those treated with al@@ dar@@ a , but only 3 % to 18 % in the patients treated with al@@ dar@@ a showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a in comparison to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ osen ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to continue until all visible tendencies have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ an@@ age range , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if in the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only completely healed , another therapy should begin ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual treatment plan .
apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub in the cleaned , infected skin area , until the cream is completely absorbed .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should be weigh@@ ed in these patients between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ emo@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case were observed with a kn@@ itted lining leading to circumcision .
in rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irrit@@ ation has been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outlet of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulties with ur@@ ination that necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous uses applied to the treatment of external tendencies in the genital and peri@@ an@@ age range , no clinical experience has yet occurred .
limited data indicate an increased rate of suscep@@ ti@@ bility reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of the tendencies .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips or the hair@@ line was not investigated .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after conclusion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or because of the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment period may be made several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
as there is currently no data available about long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be considered in super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
in patients with rel@@ ap@@ sed and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , there are no clinical experiences , therefore the application of pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study suggest that large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have a lower lik@@ el@@ ihood of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip .
there are only very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions normally decrease over the course of the therapy to intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 ac@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although the serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) can neither be quanti@@ fied after a one @-@ off nor after multiple top@@ ical application , no recommendation can be given to the application during the lac@@ tation period .
the most frequently communicated and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in related side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most common side effects reported and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ on patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common side effect , probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with the application , was a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
adverse events indicated by 25@@ 2 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
the clinical signs provided according to the test plan show that these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials often result in local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ation / fl@@ atten@@ ing / shed ( 23 % ) and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
this evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these trials with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very often result in severe er@@ y@@ subjects ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and serious scar@@ ring and scar@@ ring ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment center or in the surrounding area .
the in@@ adver@@ tent oral absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically most severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ onia norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous hydr@@ ation .
a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination showed increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines following the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies it was possible to demonstrate that efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the cow@@ l in an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment is clearly superior .
at 60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the patients were completely healed ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over 6 weeks in five times was examined in two double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ inten@@ tional bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients had been clin@@ ically healed and that remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons within a co@@ hesi@@ ve 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical symptoms after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications External lips , ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose and Super@@ modi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not investigated .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed in the three weekly application for 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated apparent half @-@ life time was approximately 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this points to an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od following top@@ ical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the der@@ mal toxic@@ ity of the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a study conducted for the der@@ mal application for four months did not reveal similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not in@@ duce tum@@ ours in the field of application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low system absorption of the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for the human being due to systemic exposure is considered to be very low .
tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active ingredient @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other ingredients ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) , not applied .
each year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all the new information that may be known , and where necessary update it .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will see patients receiving al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in regard to the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the introduction of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ ali@@ an cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , egg stock of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a safe diagnosis of Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been established , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effects that occur during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only take place in a reasonable clinical setting , in which res@@ us@@ c@@ itation facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
as a result of the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction have to be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience in the recovery of treatment after a longer interruption , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity after an interruption of treatment has to be cau@@ ti@@ ously avoided due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions .
pre@@ treatment 60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate at which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ enz with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not have direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy that include embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that have been exposed to breast milk over breast milk are present , it is recommended to not breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related responses , which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older , are listed in the following table according to the following frequencies : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing stops and facial o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe progression @-@ form and a duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients had a ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version within 3 months after the commen@@ cement of the treatment , with a more severe form of treatment within a month of 5 years ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or until a premature departure from the study ) , there were no det@@ ectable antibodies in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients in which it never came to server version .
patients with missing to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of G@@ AG sp@@ eg@@ s in the urine , while in patients with high antibodies a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was observed .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that seemed to affect clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies does not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the incidence of adverse drug reactions was typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circul@@ atory system and is absorbed by cells in the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via the body of man@@ na @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients ranging from 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( Fe@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected Fe@@ V and the absolute path in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed improvement of lung function and the ability to ga@@ it that is shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as from the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage Fe@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volum@@ ina increased propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease in G@@ AG levels was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account clin@@ ically significant changes for five efficacy variables ( expected percentage normal Fe@@ V , distance in 6 minutes walking distance , range of shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted , which mainly investig@@ ates the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age in the study ( 16 patients with the severe form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - mirror in urine in week 22 over the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z score for this age group The younger patients with the severe lead form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe progression form only limited or no progress in cognitive development were to be determined .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regi@@ mens were conducted on the G@@ AG levels in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regi@@ mens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate all new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique application , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines , except those listed under 6.@@ 6 .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not immediately used , it is not stored for more than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided the di@@ lution was performed under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .

within the given time , the owner of the licensing agreement has completed the following program of studies , whose results form the basis for the annual evaluation report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this register will provide longer @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans ) , lies either in a small amount or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine because there is a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine for cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( vi@@ cious - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread slightly to other parts of the body .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as a sole treatment in patients who have not yet been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an additional &quot; anti @-@ salt &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent de@@ hydr@@ ation ) should be given before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood is altered or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , reduced or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed thus slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ inde@@ xed into its active form can be easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer term of active cancer in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural tube , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another anti @-@ cancer drug ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin lived on an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer lived longer than with the comparison medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the introduction of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each water bottle must be dissolved with a 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which gives a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the flow bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , except for predominantly high @-@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - kal advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , except for predominantly dis@@ sec@@ tional dis@@ section epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ously as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the conclusion of the p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ously as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day of the tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed administration as well as on the day after treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the dose must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need to receive an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after each third cycle of treatment .
in patients who receive tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood picture should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te en@@ umer@@ ation .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
a dose examination must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , taking into consideration the ne@@ adi@@ r of the blood stream or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the preceding treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient receives the value before treatment
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA has to be canc@@ eled if in patients with 2 can reduc@@ ti@@ o a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ ici@@ r@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continue in the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients age 65 years of age or over 65 years of age , there is an increased risk of adverse events .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied especially in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed should not be administered to patients before their absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number again a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ al number , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 ha@@ emat@@ ological and non @-@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when a pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must be treated with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure for the reduction of treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous in@@ takes of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who have a therapy with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , drainage of the eff@@ usion before the p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed treatment is to be weigh@@ ed .
5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical studies with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed occasionally when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible degradation of reproductive capacity by means of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the treatment procedure to obtain advice on the preservation of the sperm .
high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) can result in reduced tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects .
therefore , caution is advisable when using normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in high doses .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) .
as there is no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ - mixed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ aerobic an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy .
p@@ emet@@ re@@ inde@@ xed must not be used during pregnancy except if necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is by means of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the start of treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm .
it is not known whether tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixes are transferred into breast milk and un@@ desired effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma and the random@@ ised C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ inde@@ er and 163 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .
frequency indications : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) and not known ( based on the available data of spontaneous reports ) .

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving the investig@@ ational medicine ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ ea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural oth@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted in improvement of the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after prior chemotherapy was medi@@ an survival of 8,3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .

it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced diet .
patients who take All@@ i and do not list weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot break down some fats in the diet , causing about a quarter of the fats fed with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed into the intest@@ ines .
in a third study all@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
in both studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo .
in the study with all@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no loss of weight could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with bow@@ el movement , bow@@ el movement , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , finish o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( f@@ eces ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be applied to patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( not sufficient nutrients from the digestive tract ) or on cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or breast @-@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited an approval for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cr@@ ative , fat @-@ reduced diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and you@@ ths under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ ption , the dosage is not necessary for older people and patients with impaired liver and / or kidney function .
hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Premature treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic Mal@@ absorption syndrome • Cholest@@ asis • P@@ reg@@ n@@ ancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Early treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adapted if necessary .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ related measures to prevent the failure of the oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants combined with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( internationally norm@@ alized ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical studies up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ine were in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
at a limited number of healthy volunteers who received Or@@ list@@ at at the same time , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed after the administration of a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one .
animal studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as absorption of taken @-@ in fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
the incidence of known side effects detected after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obes@@ e subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid recovery of any systemic effects caused by the li@@ pas@@ time properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect sets in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active serum rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ tic li@@ pas@@ en .
clinical studies have been derived from the fact that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of approximately 25 % of the dietary fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies of adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 substanti@@ ate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those students who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average cholesterol in the total cholesterol was 60 mg / 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average LD@@ L cholesterol decreased with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be detected spor@@ adic@@ ally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any signs of accumulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients who administered the minimum systemic res@@ or@@ bi@@ ed dose , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ shaped leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , could be identified , representing approximately 42 % of total plasma concentration .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , can@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be identified as a particular hazard to humans .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed are significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information .
the most common side effects are related to the effects of the capsules and result in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks after the treatment begins , because at this time you may have not reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize nutritional phenomena : • Beg@@ in a few days , or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat amount evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you may take each meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial after@@ life , as you may have done with other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in which these accompanying symptoms occur , learn to control these with time by adjusting their diet .
• Store medicines for children . • Do not store all@@ i after the exp@@ iry date specified on the box . • Do not store over 25 ° C . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swal@@ low it in any case . • You can take your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) which is included in this pack .

lasting weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive effect on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kil@@ oj@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as indicating the packaging of food . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should consume maximum per day .
see the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with every meal .
which amount is suitable for you , please refer to the information below which indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you . • Due to the capsule &apos;s mode of action , compliance with recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss while reducing the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to decrease progres@@ sively and continuously .
34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose approximately 0.5 kg per week in weight without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you daily use little or no stairs , climb stairs , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal daily by exercise , e.g. by 3 km walking , 30 to 45 minutes garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic calorie and fat targets and adhere to them . • Sen@@ se is a food diary with information on calorie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .

Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as for chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate cause of nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti @-@ em@@ placement drug ) .
patients under the age of 18 are not recommended because there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong and moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong cause of nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 132 out of 2@@ 23 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate cause of nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . , a permit for placing on the market of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in severely em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of a sub@@ acute in@@ let should be monitored closely following the injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is offered with simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
except in connection with another chemotherapy regi@@ men , Alo@@ xi is not to be used in the days following chemotherapy to prevent or prevent nausea and vom@@ iting .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five studied chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pl@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis showed that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induction ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ o@@ dar@@ one , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , hal@@ operi@@ dol , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies is not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical trials , the most common side effects observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly associated with Alo@@ xi , were head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage similar frequency of adverse events occurred as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effectiveness relationships observed .
di@@ aly@@ sis studies have not been carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for al@@ op@@ ia over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients were given a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1.500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 25@@ mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ life time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) , which was given intraven@@ ously to day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and dac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ised in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential .
the objective of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of I.@@ V. administered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ ed in the entire dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
according to intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration in 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular cancer patients was 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to the value measured after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the intake of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro studies on metabolism , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as unchanged ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
the total body of 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min was achieved after a single intraven@@ ous injection injection .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elim@@ inations time and the average systemic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increased , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified by this .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 From prec@@ lin@@ ical studies there were indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and can pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased incidence of liver tum@@ ours , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mark ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high doses used and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for unique application , the relevance of these results is assessed as low for the human being .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the approval of the Medic@@ ines Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution provided for the treatment of hepatitis C was approved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination , liver tissue damage indicates damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are elevated in the blood .
yeast produces a gene in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active substance structure , composition and purity of the medicine , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : email @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged ?
in addition , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed does not suff@@ ice .
the number of patients with hepatitis C responding to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
after hi@@ ring the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was again present in more patients than with the reference medicinal product ; Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug causes an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) are not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ s ( crack or cutting ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ w@@ ed wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by am@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because al@@ arms may not work against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients aged nine months , but patients under the age of 18 may not exceed 2 % of the surface of the body .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo responded to treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in skin wound , approximately 90 % of patients of both groups responded to treatment .
however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go has not been effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the job site .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go have out@@ weigh@@ ed the risks of short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , infected small in@@ fir@@ s , abra@@ sions or se@@ w@@ ed wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. for the market launch of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients with no improvement in two or three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection will begin .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections where MR@@ SA is known as a patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of secondary infected open wounds , the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or wor@@ sen@@ ing of the infected place occurs after a 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to the small plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after top@@ ical application on scrat@@ ched skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 Accor@@ ding to an oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin E@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max for top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased by 81 % on a weakened skin of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary when top@@ ical retri@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral ing@@ es@@ tion and are inadequate in relation to a statement affecting the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues / terminated or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated , it is to weigh between the benefit of nursing for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections which used Al@@ tar@@ go , the most common side effect was irrit@@ ation at the date of the administration , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ is is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ wort eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ wort eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial reef , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site is involved in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Center .
binding on this binding site inhi@@ bits pep@@ tide transfer , block partial P binding sites , and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin appears question@@ able in at least some types of infection , advice should be targeted by experts .
no differences were found in the in vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
sample collection took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake in humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of reduced skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng / h / ml ) 6@@ 60 @-@ times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP @-@ in@@ hibition .
metabolism of the in vitro oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ sm in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , lower participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid disorders .
in vitro screening on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymp@@ ho@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in the rat micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vivo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 of scrat@@ ched skin :

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , who are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved once the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if there is low risk of hepatitis B infection while immun@@ isation is low and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan can be completed from two doses .
if a refres@@ her dose is requested against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines work by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defense ) as it can defend itself against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the virus and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccine Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ult , which has been approved since 1996 , and the vaccine Twin@@ rix allowed since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults and Twin@@ rix are administered as part of a three @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ult contain identical ingredients , some of the data supporting the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month period and a 12 month interval between the two inj@@ ections .
in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix led a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar in a six @-@ month interval between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ing ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als .
the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ ming up with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two doses of vacc@@ ines . the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster dose is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , it is possible to vacc@@ inate with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ V ) antibodies observed after a basic di@@ mm@@ ing with the combination vaccine are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have responded to a hepatitis A vaccine need a booster shot as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in no more det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 @-@ ELISA units form @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and people with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies after pri@@ ming , so that in these cases the administration of further vacc@@ ines may be necessary .
since intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal success , these injection methods should be avoided .
however , in the case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ ally , as in these cases , in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration may lead to bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( D@@ T@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined mask m@@ um@@ ps @-@ m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that there may be no adequate response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ing , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever is comparable to the frequency observed in earlier thi@@ omer@@ cial and preserv@@ ative vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years , Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a basis of calculation per dose of Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis of calculation per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 doses combination vaccine .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects administered by the Ambi@@ rix were about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % among the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ can combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ing was comparable to a pro@@ band ( i.e. about 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects receiving Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of severe pain and fatigue was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ ination , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ani group was comparable to that which was observed in administration with the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine with 360 @-@ ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted between 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
for the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ect@@ ants ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3 @-@ can vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
both studies received either a 2 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 @-@ ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were aged between 12 and 15 years at the time of pri@@ ming , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immun@@ reaction observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to those detected after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial between 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ old could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is similar 24 months after im@@ muni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
when the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the absorption chim@@ ination of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( D@@ T@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined mask m@@ um@@ ps @-@ m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar serum conversion rates and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine is examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ sive appearance by eye on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
according to Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways such as bathing in waters contaminated by wastewater .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete in@@ oc@@ ulation series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of the vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) , has been shown to you / your child .
an allergic reaction can express itself through it@@ chy skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If an allergic reaction has occurred in your child for an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has .
• If you want fast protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced amounts of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection against termination of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected with people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense , or if you / your child is undergoing a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines ( including those you can get without prescri@@ bing ) or if you have recently been vacc@@ inated / or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated / has given or that it is planned in the near future .
however , in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine needs to be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot; &quot; &quot;
important information on certain other constitu@@ ents of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) has been shown to you / your child .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data that has become known since the issu@@ ance of the first authorization for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP assumed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was placed in traffic only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure .
am@@ mo@@ l can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
am@@ mo@@ or is divided into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ hip ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study , since amp@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do drug , i.e. without active agent ) .
am@@ mo@@ or may also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disorders or taste , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mo@@ or in patients with ure@@ a cycle could effectively prevent excessive ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ ola was approved in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval , limited information about this drug was available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme shortage already mani@@ f@@ ests in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , there is then an indication of the use if a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis exists .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low or swal@@ low tablets , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake required for the patient &apos;s growth and development .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
for patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ic acid , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required at a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency have to obtain ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and eye formation .
as metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the significance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal propag@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons occurred .
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a decreased number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least one adverse event ( AE ) occurred in 56 % of patients and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , ar@@ tery neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred with a 5 @-@ month @-@ old inf@@ ant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity for intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound that con@@ ju@@ gates to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine by acet@@ yl@@ ated glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
sto@@ ich@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients suffering from disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the earliest manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always infectious and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues within the first year of life .
through hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative routes of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zene and sodium phen@@ yl acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born babies at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first months of life ) diagnosed diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia cephal@@ opathy , survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time for many people with mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
survival rate was 98 % in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ go@@ tic form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ic A@@ scar@@ Pil@@ low deficiency ) , which were treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in the liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine , and phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is created .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after administration of a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with ure@@ a cycle disorders , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also investigated in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were detected .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary tract disturbances or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day ) was det@@ ectable in the next morning after a fast fast no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate had no plain@@ tive effects with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children , who cannot swal@@ low a tablet , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ hip or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( particularly bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
for patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ic acid , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required at a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat fl@@ utes were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ) before birth , l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyr@@ amid@@ al cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex came .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , ar@@ tery neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
sto@@ ich@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus
based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with ure@@ a cycle disorders can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
after an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ular form 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were detected .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of no more than 25 ° C .
in this procedure the small measuring spoon is 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring sco@@ op 8.@@ 6 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
if a patient has to receive the medication by means of a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after the consumption of proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may interfere with breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disorders , trac@@ eability , dis@@ ori@@ ti@@ bility , memory problems and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital to initiate appropriate treatment .
if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in the blood stream ( red blood cells , white blood cells , plat@@ el@@ ets ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention ( swelling ) , taste disorders , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , unpleasant skin odor , rash , kidney function , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed are significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ iry date specified on the box and the container according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use@@ able up to &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the pack AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish colour and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot;
30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be administered or@@ ally on the same individual doses or via a ga@@ stri@@ c fi@@ st@@ ula ( tube that runs directly into the stomach through the abdominal wall ) or a nas@@ al probe ( tube that is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Remove a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate from the container . • Take a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the upper edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon .
angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stopping &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if an@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients with a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox was compared with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI , the patient frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the administration of GP@@ I - was as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ activity ) after 30 days or one year .
in patients who underwent a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox in relation to all indicators was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during one PCI .
the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd in September 2004 for placing an@@ gi@@ ox on the whole of the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ prolifer@@ ation inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in emergency intervention or if early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if there is another PCI in the patient , an additional minus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion can be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours .
in the immediate vicinity of the procedure , a joint of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox@@ in in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is reduced to less than 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us input of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before use and the dose of the bol@@ us dose is rapidly administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) that one PCI is subjected to ( whether treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din for ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bol@@ us dose to be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment on an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) , an@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after termination of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ question@@ able He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after ending the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active agent or other constitu@@ ents or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • Active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding because of a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ ost@@ atic system and / or ir@@ reversible cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for patients with di@@ aly@@ sis
patients must be carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is given in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if the majority of PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din appear most ble@@ ed@@ ings at arter@@ ial point @-@ points , patients with a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may undergo hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din again reaches the level before treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanisms of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations ) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ ine with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ ase@@ ology parameters are checked regularly .
the animal experimental studies are insufficient in terms of impact on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ question@@ able he@@ par@@ in or en@@ ox@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
in both the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and the compar@@ isons treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding performed significantly less frequently under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- or inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point of punc@@ ture that necess@@ itated a radi@@ ological or surgical intervention of ≥ 3 g / dl of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with a well @-@ known blood vessel , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ ture centres , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information on adverse events is based on data from a clinical trial with a bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din in 6000 patients who underwent a PCI .
in both the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and the compar@@ isons treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects not listed above have been reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are group@@ ed together according to system organic classes in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is immediately broken off and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ atic inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center as well as in the ani@@ onic binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or at cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and with it its effect , is reversible , because th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis in turn re@@ generates the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with serum from patients in which it had occurred in the past to he@@ par@@ in@@ duce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) did not in@@ duce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ gregation reaction .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din demonstrates a dose and concentration @-@ dependent an@@ tik@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is covered by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed in the following cases , an additional minus of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion can be increased for the duration of the surgery to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ question@@ able ha@@ par@@ in or en@@ ox@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / Non @-@ ST He@@ aling inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to receive a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the start of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or with the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were equally distributed across the 3 arms .
about 77 % of patients had recurring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients underwent a angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on quad@@ ru@@ ple and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study involving more than 6,000 patients who underwent a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are shown in table 10 .
clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as for patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din as pep@@ tide goes through a cat@@ aboli@@ sm into its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent re@@ utilization of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ yte , which results from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in .
elimination occurs in patients with normal kidney function after a process of first order with a terminal half @-@ life of 25 ± 12 minutes .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks during an exposure up to 10 @-@ cases of the clinical ste@@ ady @-@ state plasma concentration ) was limited to over@@ shooting pharmac@@ ological effects .
side effects as a result of prolonged physiological stress in response to non @-@ home@@ ost@@ atic co@@ ag@@ ulation were not observed after short @-@ term exposure comparable to that in clinical application , even with very much higher dosage .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use solution 17 does not take place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions , it cannot be stored for more than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
An@@ gi@@ ox is a freeze @-@ dried powder in single @-@ dose @-@ flow bottles of type 1 glass to 10 ml , which is sealed with a but@@ yl rubber stopper and sealed with a cap of pressed aluminium .
5 ml sterile water for injection purposes are given into a water bottle an@@ gi@@ ox and slightly wa@@ ved until everything has dissolved completely and the solution is clear .
5 ml are taken from the pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle and dil@@ uted with 5 % sodium chlori@@ de solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5@@ mg / ml Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or upper arm or administered as a continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to control the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively .
insulin @-@ lu@@ ci@@ sin is very slightly different from the human insulin , and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting insulin analog .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body is unable to produce insulin , in two studies involving a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and a study of 5@@ 72 children between four and 17 years .
in the case of type 2 diabetes , where the body is unable to work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in six months compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin boun@@ ce .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin @-@ lu@@ ci@@ li@@ s@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection through continuous in@@ fusion in the abdom@@ en area .
because of the reduced glucose levels and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin demand in patients with a restriction of liver function can be reduced .
any change of active strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or manufacturing method may result in a change in insulin requirements .
3 inadequate dosage or termination of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these states are potentially life threatening .
switching from one patient to another type of insulin or insulin of another manufacturer should be performed under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the timing of the occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the effectiveness of the used insulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme .
the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ conver@@ ters , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates , and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , the effects of sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic drugs such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and Reser@@ pin can be weakened or missing the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ acts .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin secre@@ te enters into human breast milk , but in general insulin enters neither breast milk nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral application .
in the following , the adverse drug interactions known from clinical trials are group@@ ed by system organ@@ classes and arranged according to decreasing frequency of occurrence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
cold welding , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , drow@@ sin@@ ess , excessive dog @-@ ger , changes in vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is fo@@ amed to continuously change injection area within the injection area , as a result li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may occur at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia with un@@ consciousness may be treated by an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous dosage of glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose projection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the serious hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine the effect occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin @-@ lu@@ ci@@ li@@ s@@ ine showed a low @-@ level glucose @-@ reducing effect in the therapeutic @-@ relevant dosage range of 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0,3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glucose @-@ reducing effect , just like human insulin .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine has a twice as fast impact as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ ing effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was evident that a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved in an application of insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine 2 minutes before the meal , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin @-@ lu@@ ci@@ li@@ s@@ ine was inherited 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ al control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin @-@ lu@@ ci@@ li@@ sin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , such as in human normal insulin , which is given 2 mic@@ rons before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin @-@ lu@@ ci@@ li@@ sin in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before beginning of the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin @-@ lu@@ ci@@ li@@ sin at a dose of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after@@ ward ) after the start of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
