<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public assessment report (EPAR) in which it explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the packaging supplement (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like further information on the basis of the CHMP recommendation, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Intellectual thinking and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness, in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of anorexic high spirits) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders when the oral consumption of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used for inhalation or melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other drugs at the same time as Abilify, the dose should be adjusted by Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects signal transmission between brain cells by means of "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol is believed to be a "partial agony" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitter acts to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize brain activity, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent the occurrence of symptoms was examined in three studies lasting up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies of 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased anxiety over a period of two hours compared to a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, to 160 patients in which the symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest with which by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the change in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution for taking into account (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg were significantly more restless than patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In four of the five short-term studies, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, Abilify prevented up to 74 weeks of effective placebo for the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common Abilify side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled tick), nausea, drowsiness (drowsiness), drowsiness (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision, somnolence (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar-I disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients with predominantly manic episodes, predominated in the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, the Committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for placing Abilify on the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes were responding to the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, independent of the meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Considering the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of antipsychotic therapy, even in case of treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased suicidal risk in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, conduction disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celeriated and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesien: in clinical trials which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports about dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="39">If there is signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesia in a patient treated with Abilify, it should be considered to reduce the dose or break down treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions related to seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, had an increased risk of sterility compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events associated with Aripiprazol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsis, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blockers, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered clinically important.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC from Aripiprazol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">For CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabavers, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism agents.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose level before the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or esitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazol showed no significant effect on the metabolsm of the substrate of CYP2D6 (Dextrometmorphine / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C19 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (dextrometmorphine).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the insufficient data layer for safety in humans and because of the concerns caused in the reproductive studies of the animal, unless the potential benefit justifies clearly the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks, a total of lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazol was 15.1% in patients under Oystapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in Bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS amounted to 23.5% in patients with cataract treatment and 53.3% in patients with cervical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazol treatment was 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term development phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment was 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine Phosphokinase), in general temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects associated with antipsychotic therapy are the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional acute overdosages with Aripiprazol have been observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no information on the efficacy of a hematalysis in the treatment of overdosing with Aripiprazol; however, it is unlikely that hematalysis is useful in the treatment of overdosing, since Aripiprazol has a high plasma penetration.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agagonistic effect on dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2 and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a-receptor as well as a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to the alpha-1-adrenergic and the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks in healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the nucleus caudatus and on the Putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, in week 52 the proportion of respondents who had adhered to the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significantly higher return rate of 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Oystapin-controlled, multinational dual-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was significantly less patients increased weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy trials for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazl showed a efficacy in week 3 versus placebo, which was comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12, Aripiprazol showed a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which in some cases did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks for manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilization phase, Aripiprazol showed himself superior to placebo in regard to the prevention of bipolar residues, mainly in the prevention of a return to the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for stretching and hydroxyelling of Aripiprazol, the N-dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean time of elimination is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol for extensive metabolism via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= "poor") metabsiners via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A population-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics did not indicate clinically significant differences regarding ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or exposures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin-Pigment Accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal rinds-adenomas / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the mean steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazol in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16 to 8 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of hydroxy- Aripiprazol were no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the bile of apes, and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solution.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of the 3 and 11 times the middle Steady State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="143">Abilify injection solution is used for quick control of agility and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="144">As soon as it is clinically appropriate, the treatment with Aripiprazol injection solution should be terminated and commenced with the oral application of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="145">In order to increase the resorption and minimise the variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deeply into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended in the circumvention of adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status under consideration of the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If an additional oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazole, see the summary of the features of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify melt tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazol injection solution in patients with atoxicity and behavioural disorders that were otherwise caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazol injection solution, patients should be observed with extreme sediment or blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazol injection solution are not available for patients suffering from alcohol or drug toxicity (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, conduction disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celeriated and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports about dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing consciousness layers and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, perspiration and cardiac arrhythmias).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsis, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the segregation was greater compared to that of Aripiprazol, in a study in which healthy volunteers Aripiprazol (15 mg dose) was administered intramuscularly and which at the same time received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blockers, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered clinically important.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabavers can result in common use with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteaseinhibitors, may have similar effects and should therefore be carried out similar can reductions.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose level before the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">If 106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) received intramuscularly, the intensity of the Sedation was greater compared to that of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events were more common in clinical studies with Aripiprazol injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107: the following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified in clinical trials with oral analomyelia as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients with cataract treatment and 13.1% in placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term development phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients with Aripiprazol treatment was 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatinphosphate kinase), in general temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects associated with antipsychotic therapy are the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders were the Aripiprazol injection solution with statistically significant greater improvements of aggitightness / behavioural problems compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agility and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms regarding detachment and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed mean improvement from the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score for the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe detachment, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be observed due to decreased patient number.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, in week 52 the proportion of respondents who had adhered to the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol (oral) showed a significantly higher return rate of 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Oscapin-controlled, multinational dual-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks involving 314 patients and the primary study target 'weight gain', an increase of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.) occurred in significantly fewer patients.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which in some cases did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilization phase, Aripiprazol showed himself superior to placebo in regard to the prevention of bipolar residues, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazol AUC is 90% bigger in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection the AUC after administration of the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time was applied until reaching the maximum plasma level in 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazol injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated administration in systemic exposure (AUC), which was 15 or 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on the toxicity toxicity of intravenous applications, there was no safety concern about maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29-times (rabbits) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazol (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data could not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans; therefore they have limited or no significance for the clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin-Pigment Accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal-adrenal adenomas / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazol in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16 to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was examined in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which three quarters had previously received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole gift or as monotherapy) was compared with the medication containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel medication.</seg>
<seg id="270">Only those patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer were not able to make any difference in the effects of efficacy indicators such as time to worsening disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer were shown in terms of these indicators that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective in patients with whom the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional paclitaxel and that it does not have to be given to other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the transport of Abraxane in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not indicated (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophal number &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In the case of sensory neuropathy, the treatment must be interrupted until an improvement is reached in grade 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">There were no studies with patients with impaired renal function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impairment of the kidney function (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nano-articulated formulation of paclitaxel, which could have significantly different pharmacological characteristics than other formulations of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptomatic treatment should be initiated and the patient may not be treated with paclitaxel again.</seg>
<seg id="283">No additional Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated in the patients until the number of neutrosters rose again &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the number of thrombocytes increased again &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunctions (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly associated cardiotoxicity was unproven in connection with Abraxane, cardiac events in the indicated patients range are not unusual, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea occur in patients after the administration of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual medications and constilling methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or women in childbearing age who do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should use a reliable method of contraception during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should consult a barrier service before treatment, as the therapy with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very often) and dizziness (often) that can affect the transport capacity and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in the pivotal clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most prominent hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Side effects listed in Table 1 are the side effects that have been associated with the gift of Abraxane as monotherapy at each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1000); very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagie, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, painless gum, loose stool, oessophagitis, pain in the lower abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, groin pain, muscle spasms, pains in the skeletal musculature, flank pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in context in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimate of the actual incidence is possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimikrotubules substance that promotes the aggregation of microtubules from the tubula and stabilises microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization results in an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transocytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in the context of in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel by endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumeric receptor and occurs due to the albumin protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single-armed unfaded studies and of 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion of more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as 3-hour infusion with premediation to prevent an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study 64% of patients had a compromised general state (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree of patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathic degree 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for decay to baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">Pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The exposure level exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After intravenous administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft connection of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared with intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values following a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane administration (43%) than after a solvent-containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, it is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative precipitation of the unchanged active substance was 4% of the total dose with less than 1% of the total metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available to patients at the age of 75, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>

<seg id="361">The treatment with abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation, Abyamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection may also be performed by the patient or his supervisor, provided they have received appropriate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended area (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems anaemia may be caused by erythropoietinsufficiency, or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell containing a gene (DNA) that enables it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared as an injection into a vein in a major study involving 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused anaemia, compared with the reference drug.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected at least eight weeks of Eprex / Erypo into a vein before they were either switched to Abyamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of abecamed under the skin were examined with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients who suffered an anaemia caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who were converted to abecamed were maintained in the same degree as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">Compared to this, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which occasionally leads to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Unseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems, as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that for absentamed according to the provisions of the European Union, evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that makes Abseamed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>

<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and the risk of transfusion due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia in the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or inadequate, in case of planned larger surgical procedures requiring a large blood volume substitute (4 or more units of blood in women; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>

<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml that cannot participate in a autologous blood donor program.</seg>
<seg id="385">Hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients in which the hemoglobin concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l) should lie.</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms of anemia and disease may vary depending on age, gender and total disease burden; therefore, it is necessary to assess the individual clinical course and condition of disease by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin levels can occasionally be observed in a patient over or below the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dosage is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used at the lowest approved dose, which is required to control anemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical results suggest that patients with a very low hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial anaemia is less pronounced (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The clinical results suggest that patients with a very low hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial anaemia is less pronounced (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by an intravenous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and follow-up may vary depending on age, gender and total disease burden; therefore, the patient's evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used at the lowest approved dose, which is required for controlling the symptoms of anemia.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the hemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the Retiulocyte Numbers by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be retained 150 I.U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin rise &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the reticulocyte number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl has increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the hemoglobin value has increased by ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the Reticulocyte number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to the epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood cannons is required, should receive abseamed at a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should begin as early as possible - for example, a few weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood donor program, so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the abortion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each 10 consecutive days before, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of dialysis can be given via the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine into circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who suffer from the treatment with any erythropoetin at erythroblastoma (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive any abecamed or other erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastoma).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous rombosis (e.g. anamnestically known venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">The application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients with a larger elective orthopaedic procedure: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, vascular disease of the otides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular accident.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoma (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months to years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of action defined as a reduction in hemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticulocyte value should be determined and the common causes of failure (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium toxicity, infection or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are studied.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticulocyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the reticulocytes "index"), is lower (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocytic and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other reason of an effective loss is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow to diagnose a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of abseamed in patients with a risk of antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit attributed to the administration of epoetins when the hemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the symptoms of anemia and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The increase in hemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">The findings of anaemia associated with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, do not accelerate the progression of kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="420">In the case of tumour patients receiving chemotherapy, epoetin alfa should be considered a 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin-alfa and the erythropoetin response (patients who may need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is greater than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8,1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with paragraph 4.2 in order to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - Dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are foreseen for a larger elective orthopaedic procedure, if possible, before starting the epoetin-alfa therapy the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing greater elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate thromboseprophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially with underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that in the case of treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial hemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl, an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events may exist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetiins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumor patients with symptomatic anemia, or decrease the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">When Epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the ciclosporin dose should be adjusted to increasing haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there is no indication of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Over thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents, deep venous thromboses, arterial thromboses, retinal thromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients with erythropoetin treatment, so also patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients treated with erythropoetine.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can cause thrombotic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetic algorithm-derived epoetin alfa is glycosified and is identical with the amino acids and carbohydrate content with the endogenous human erythropoetin, which was isolated from the urine of anaesthetic patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa specifically stimulates erythropoesis and does not affect leucopoesis.</seg>

<seg id="438">Survival and progression were studied in five large controlled trials involving a total of 2833 patients; four of these studies were double-blind placebo-controlled trials and</seg>
<seg id="439">In the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and the control patients.</seg>
<seg id="440">In these studies, patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin were consistent with an anaemia due to various common malignancies, statistically significantly higher mortality than in the controls.</seg>
<seg id="441">Overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thromboses and related complications associated with recombinant human erythropoetin treated patients and at controls.</seg>
<seg id="442">There is an increased risk of thromboembolic events in tumor patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin, and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is not clear how far these results are transferred to the use of recombinant human erythropoetin in tumor patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hemoglobin value below 13 g / dl, as few patients with these characteristics were included in the examined data.</seg>
<seg id="444">Epoetin-alfa regulations after repeated intravenous application showed a half-life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half-life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="445">After subcutaneous injection, the serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the serum levels achieved after intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="446">There is no cumulation: the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first administration or 24 hours after the last administration.</seg>
<seg id="447">Bone marrow fibrosis is a well known complication of chronic renal insufficiency in humans and might be due to secondary hyperparathyreoidism or unknown factors.</seg>

<seg id="573">The first study included nearly 8,000 older women with osteoporosis, and the number of spine and hip fractures was examined over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who had recently suffered a hip fracture; the number of fractures has been studied over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">At Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies of 357 patients and compared six months with Risedronat (another bisphosphonate).</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that breaks down bone substance) again normalized in the blood or decreased by at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under Aclasta (without any other osteoporosis) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to the placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="578">In comparison with all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis) the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study with men and women with hip fracture 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledron acid or other bisphosphonate or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients at Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion area and osteonecrosis (loss of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclasta provides information for doctors who prescribe aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains information about how to use the medicine, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission granted Novartis Europharm Limited to the company Novartis Europharm Limited for the launch of Aclasta in the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • Contractual indications in pregnancy and in nursing women • Required of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, adequate physical activity, non smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, an intravenous infusion of 5 mg aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the Paget with Aclasta, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure a sufficient intake of calcium for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The incidence of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acetamol can be reduced shortly after the application of acetamol or ibuprofen after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinin clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary because bioavailability, distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and teenagers Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data on safety and efficacy are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended for patients with severe kidney failure (Creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Preexisting hypokalemia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before the treatment begins with Aclasta (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid insertion of the effect of zoledron acid on bone conversion, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia may develop whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the infusion of aclasta (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure a sufficient intake of calcium for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should be examined before an application of bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dentistry.</seg>
<seg id="604">No data is available for patients needing dental intervention, if the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecroses in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical assessment by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The incidence of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acetamol or ibuprofen can be reduced shortly after the application of acetamol or ibuprofen (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of cases reported as serious side effects of atrial fibrillation was increased (1.3%) (51%) (51 of 3,862) compared to those receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug interactions are listed in table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney Dysfunction Zoledron Acid was associated with kidney function disorders that have been associated as a decrease in the kidney function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatinin clearance (measured annually before administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as impaired renal function were in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years comparable between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinins within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta versus 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the assessment of the laboratory findings, the transient asymptomatic calcium levels, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2,10 mmol / l), showed up at 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus-Paget-studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study on the prevention of clinical fractures after a fracture fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study on the prevention of clinical fractures after a littoral fracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after administration of zoledron acid in a large clinical study were reported about local reactions to the infusion area, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecroses in the maxillofacial surgery were reported, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecroses (primarily in the jaw area) that were treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study of 7,736 patients showed osteonecrosis in the jaw area in a patient treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the event of an overdose leading to clinically relevant hypoglycaemia, a compensation can be achieved by means of oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in postmenopausal women (7,736 women between 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density (BMD) T score for the Schenkelhals ≤ -2.5 with or without any signs of an existing spinal fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric spinal fractures Aclasta were significantly reduced over a period of three years and the frequency of one or more new eddy body fractures after one year (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed an equally lasting effect over three years, resulting in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%) reduced risk for hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta significantly increased bone density on lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the hemisphere by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology In 152 post-menopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), bone biopsies were taken from the pelvis a year after the third annual dose.</seg>
<seg id="628">In comparison to placebo, a microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular arbone volume and the preservation of the trabecular arbone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C-telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in sub-groups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during study time.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta reduced BSAP significantly by 30% after 12 months compared to the initial value and was kept at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The overall mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, in comparison to placebo treatment the BMD increased the BMD at the overall shrinkage and shrinkage at all points of time.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment led to an increase of the BMD by 5.4% compared to placebo treatment at 5.4% of the total shrinkage and 4.3% at the placebo arm.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study, 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in men treated with acetonias compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (Study CZOL446M2308), the once-yearly administration of acetonionate in relation to the weekly dosing of alendronate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was studied in patients and patients at the age of 30 with radiologically confirmed, mainly light to moderately heavy Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the age-specific upper normal value when taken into the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledron acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of Risedronat once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease of pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the baseline for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month trial could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 with Aclasta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response at 141 of those patients treated with Risedronate could be maintained at a mean duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of zoledron acid in 64 patients revealed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h followed by a long period of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life t ½ -α 0.24 and t ½ -1,87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal eliminations cycle time t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages of distribution (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) presumably represent the rapid resorption in the bones and excretion through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance of metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because zoledron acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Specific patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of the zoledron acid correlated with the Kreatinin-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin-Clearance, and was in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (clcr = 50 - 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function disorder up to a creatinin clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the zoledron acid required.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for severe kidney function interference (Creatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest intravenous IV single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg body weight and in rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In the case of trials on dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC the 6fold of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous use, the renal tolerability of Zoledron acid was administered in rats using doses of 0.6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dosage equivalent to the 7fold of the human-therapeutic exposure to the AUC, equivalent to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated exposure to cumulated expositions that exceed the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects in other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, and intravenous injections were performed.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common finding in recurrent studies was an increased primary Spongiosa in the metaphysis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, an infestation, which reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenicity in doses from 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum levels of serum.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public assessment report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes drug) is not indicated. • It can be used together with another diabetes medicine (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) that cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyreside or insulin, the current dose of the sulfonyuric substance or insulin can be retained with the beginning of the acettos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), where the dose of the sulfonyl resins or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, which makes type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients, the efficacy of acetone in tripletherapy was examined; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyanine, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which indicates that the blood sugar levels were lowered in the application of doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional administration of actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonylic substance showed a reduction in HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study where the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin had a reduction in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who also took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with actos were visual disorders, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypoaesthesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone mirrors - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that, as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin, Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in which metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a permit for placing an account in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and wear on one side the marking" "" "15" "" "and on the other side the inscription" "" "Actos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">There are no data available for the application of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">For patients who are at risk of having at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease) to develop a decompensated heart failure, the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">Cardiovascular Outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under the age of 75 with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease has been performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure, but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that refer to hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision as to whether the treatment of patients with pioglitazone continued, should be directed to the safety of the laboratory parameters from clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been demonstrated, which can derive from fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution, a small reduction of the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and haematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the therapy with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and haematocroth by 3.1% and insulin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 1-2% and haematocroth by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral dual or triple combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, a decrease in visual acuity was reported under the treatment of thiazolidindia, including Pioglitazone, an incidence or deterioration of diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular edema, but concordant doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report about disturbances of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The refractive fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive trial, a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazon, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is to be canceled (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pioglitazon does not exert any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker, and HMGCoA reduction inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC of Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazone decreases the hyperinsulin resistance resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother's animal, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequent &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not available from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turret and the refractive index of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone ALT ascents over three times the upper limit of the normal range were equally common as in placebo, but more rarely than in comparison groups under Metformin or Sulfonyl resins.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe heart failure under Pioglitazon was 1.6% higher than placebo, if Pioglitazone or Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it has rarely been reported about heart failure under Pioglitazon, but more often if Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with Pioglitazon and more than 7,400 patients in the treated groups treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="796">Compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) patients treated with Pioglitazon were treated in a trial period of 3.5 years, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms occured.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific core receptors (peroxisome proliferator activated Receptor-γ), leading to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclincide as monotherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect was completed (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by Pioglitazon in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of three months of optimization with insulin was randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon the mean HbA1c reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies over a year a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients was statistically significant compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabetics for 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo, a reduction in overall plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels as well as insignificant, but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the overall plasmatglycerides and free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol level compared to placebo, metformin or bile.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, a statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was found under Pioglitazon, while lower levels of metformin and cilicide were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the Nüchtern triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride level, both on triglyceride absorption and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive trial, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomized in groups that received either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentrations of unmodified Pioglitazone in plasma usually reach 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to the effectiveness is roughly three times the efficacy of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in rotting (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination duration of unchanged pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of the oral clearance of the parent substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anaemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazone reduces hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance in the uterus, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the bladder epithelium was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other thiazolidindions led to an increased incidence of colonic tumours.</seg>

<seg id="823">The refractive fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive trial, a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazon, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years the effects of combination therapy of metformin were examined with pioglitazone or Gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies over 1 year a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients was statistically significant compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the Nüchtern triglycerides but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride level, which has an effect on Tryglycerid absorption as well as hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the aim of its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary revascularization and revascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that the intake of pioglitazone does not involve cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>

<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission issued an approval for the company Novo Nordisk A / S for the launch of Actraphane in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily, if a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly, for example, by an intensified insulin therapy, can perceive hypoglycaemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in strength, brand (manufacturer), type of insulin (fast acting, biphasic, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (using recombinant DNA to insulin animal origin) may cause a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to Actraphane, it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Prior to travelling, passing over several time zones, the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his doctor, as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals being used or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The physician must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines they have taken.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, which can occur in a non-controlled diabetestherapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemias can lead to unconsciousness and / or seizures and end up with temporary or permanent disturbance of brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Diseases of the nervous system Occasional - Peripheral neuropathy A rapid improvement in blood sugar control can be associated with complaints which are referred to as acute painful neuropathy and are usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5. an intensification of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement in blood sugar levels may, however, be associated with a temporary deterioration of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Diseases of the skin and the subcutaneous tissue Associated with lipodystrophy at the injection point can arise a lipodystrophy if missed to change the injection holes within the injection area.</seg>
<seg id="884">Common diseases and complaints at the administration of the administration - Local hypersensitivity reactions at the injection site During the insulin therapy, local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma occur at the injection site).</seg>
<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system Occasional - Urticaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity, including generalized rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angioneurotic edema, breathing difficulties, palpitations, low blood pressure and fainting / unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">Hypoglycaemia can, however, be gradually developed: • Healthy hypoglycemias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugar, candy, biscuits or sugar-containing fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven help person or by glucose that is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the maximum working time is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration of action is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The Resorption Profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with rapid resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of circuit (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the Actraphane flow bottle is taken out of the refrigerator - to increase the temperature of the insulin to room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before it is stressed in accordance with the instructions for use for the first use.</seg>

<seg id="1171">In the first study that took part in 1,072 patients, the efficacy of three different adenuric doses (once daily 80, 120 and 240 mg) was compared with that of a placebo (pseudo-medication) and Allopurinol (another drug to treat hyperuricemia).</seg>
<seg id="1172">In the second study, two doses of Adenuric (once daily 80 and 120 mg) were compared to 762 patients each year with Allopurinol.</seg>
<seg id="1173">In both studies, Allopurinol was administered at a dose of once daily 300 mg; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day.</seg>
<seg id="1174">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose uric acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements.</seg>
<seg id="1175">In the first study 48% (126 of 262) of patients who took adenuric in a dose of 80 mg once a day, and 65% (175 of 269) of patients who took 120 mg once a day, had a uric acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1176">In comparison, this was the case with 22% (60 of 268) of patients under Allopurinol and none of the 134 patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of Adenuric (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headache, diarrhea, nausea (nausea), rash and abnormal liver values.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Especially in patients with heart problems in the prehistory, there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Adenuric was more effective in reducing the uric acid levels in the blood than Allopurinol, but could also have a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in diseases that have already led to primal deposits (including a medical history known or currently present) and / or rheumatic arthritis).</seg>
<seg id="1181">If the serum acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) after 2-4 weeks, a dose increase to ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x may be considered daily.</seg>
<seg id="1182">In patients with severe kidney function restriction, efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated (Creatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min, see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1183">Children and adolescents, as there are no experiences in children and adolescents, is not recommended to use febuxostat in this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Organ transplant recipients Since there are no experiences in organ transplant recipients, the application of febuxostat in this group of patients is not recommended (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">Cardiovascular diseases In patients with ischemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, treatment with febuxostat is not recommended (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other harnseed treatments, it may result in an acute attack during the treatment process, because by lowering the serum resin acid level, uric acid deposits can initially be mobilised in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="1187">B. in malignant diseases and their treatment, Lesch- Nyhan syndrome, the absolute concentration of Xanthin in the urine is so widespread in rare cases that it comes to a deposit in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Liver diseases During phase 3 clinical trials, light abnormalities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before the start of the febuxostatuses and in the course of the course (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline tin was not performed any interaction studies on febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibition leads to an increase in theophylline level (an inhibition of the metabolism of theophyllin was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects, the simultaneous administration of febuxostat and naproxen was 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in febuxostature (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the use of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with a clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorothazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicine or Indometacin without a dose adjustment for febuxostat or the other active ingredient required at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study with subjects 120 mg of ADENURIC 1 x daily a mean 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, which indicates a possible weak inhibitory effect of febuxostat to the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that concurrent consumption of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, slowing absorption of febuxostat (about 1 hour) and a decrease in Cmax by 32%, but no significant change in the AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregnancies do not include side effects of febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of fetus / newborns.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle, operation of machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investigator was observed in the total febuxostats in the pivotal study of phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term (1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal relationship with febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors identified in these patients were an arteriosclerotic disease and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensated heart failure in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100) and rare (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000) adverse events in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of febuxostat and which were reported in all Febuxostat treatment groups more than once are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients treated with colchicin. * * In clinical trials, severe skin rashes or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">7 Open long-term extension studies In the open long-term extension studies, 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year, 322 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients treated with febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The treatment-related events reported during the long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in phase 3 studies (see Table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported in all Febuxostat- treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients receiving febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patients years), according to the indications occasionally.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported in the pivotal studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, sleeplessness, hypesthesia, eye-catching, skin discoloration, skin lesion, bursitis, protein urie, renal insufficiency, erectile dysfunction, increase in potassium concentration in the blood, decrease of TSH concentration in the blood, decrease in lymphocytes, decrease in the number of white blood cells.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The mode of action of uric acid is the final product of the purinmetabolism in humans and arises as part of the reaction askade hypoxanthin → Xanthin → uric acid.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Febuxostat is a potent, non-Purin-selective inhibitor of the XO (NP-SIxO) with a Ki-value for in vitro inhibition which is below the nanomolar area.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Clinical study results The efficacy of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies of Phase 3 (APEX Study and FACT study as described below), which were performed with 1,832 patients with hyperuricaemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum levels of serum were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="1212">Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 258), ADENURIC 240 mg / dl or 100 mg 1 x daily (n = 10) for patients with a serum creatinine value at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed a statistically significant superiority in the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with commonly used doses of Allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed a statistically significant superiority in the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the conventional dose of Allopurinol 300 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1216">The reduction in serum hardness levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and kept permanently throughout the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received Allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum creatins &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with kidney function restriction The APEX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction (ie.</seg>
<seg id="1219">With ADENURIC, the primary efficacy endpoint was 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage return of serum supplemental acid concentrations in subjects, notwithstanding their kidney function (58% in the group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum supplemental acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl Etwa 40% of patients (APEX and FACT study) had a serum supplementation of ≥ 10 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data of the open extension study phase 3 in two years showed that the reduction in serum levels of serum was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l), so that less than 3% of patients in the months 16-24 needed a treatment against glowing (i.e. more than 97% of patients did not need treatment for a glowing).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the gout, which resulted in 54% of patients a complete disappearance of the lymph nodes up to month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µW / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients receiving Allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the surface area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) from Febuxostat were administered in a simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dosed proportionally.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg a rise in the AUC is observed for febuxostat, which is greater than the dose proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day, the Cmax amounts to about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change in serum supplemental acid concentration was observed if this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent Steady-state distribution volume (Vss / F) from Febuxostat lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primary binding of albumin) and is constant over the concentration width that is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsomes, these oxidative metabolites are predominantly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatglucuronid is primarily produced by UGT 1A1, 1A8, and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of Febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose in the urine was found as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the known oxidative metabolites and its conjugate (13%) and other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over the urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the chair was found as unchanged febuxostat (12%), the known oxidative metabolites and its conjugate (25%) and other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Special patient groups renal insufficiency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the Cmax of Febuxostat did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The mean total AUC of Febuxostat increased about 1.8 times from 7.5 μ g / h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.2 μ g / h / ml in a group with severe kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 Liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of ADENURIC in patients with mild (ChildPugh classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh classification B) Liver function restriction, the Cmax and AUC of febuxostat changed significantly in comparison to subjects with normal liver function.</seg>

<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats, a statistically significant increase in urinary bladder tumors (transition cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with xanthin stones in the highly dosed group, with approximately 11 times the exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of a specific Purinmetabolization and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It was found that febuxostat in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats.</seg>
<seg id="1241">At high doses, which were about 4 x 3 times the human therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity occurred, which accompanied by a reduction in the capacity and a developmental delay in the descendants of rats.</seg>

<seg id="1258">If you have a poison effect at the moment (sudden appearance of severe pain, sensitivity to pressure, redness, heat and joint swelling), wait until the case attack is cleared before you start treating ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1259">This does not have to be at all, but may also occur with you, especially during the first treatment weeks or - months, if you are taking ADENURIC.</seg>

<seg id="1261">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are using / applying other medications or recently taken / used, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1262">It is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take medicine that contains one of the following substances, since interactions with ADENURIC may occur and your doctor may need to consider necessary measures. • Mercaptopurine (for the treatment of cancer) • Theophyllin (for the treatment of asthma) • Warfarin (for blood thinning in case of heart disease)</seg>

<seg id="1275">ADROVANCE is used for the treatment of osteoporosis (a disease in which the bones are brittle) in women after menopause, in which there is a risk for a small vitamin D mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first meal of the day, which is to take 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already being used separately from each other in medicines approved in the European Union, the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to prove the efficacy of ADROVANCE in relation to increasing vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those who only received alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headache, musculoskeletal pain (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain, dyspepsia (diarrhoea), blockage, diarrhoea (ulceration), cerebral abnormalities (swallowing disorders), inflated abdomen and sour upset.</seg>
<seg id="1283">ADROVANCE may not be used in patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) against alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It must not be used in cases of oesophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium level) or in patients who cannot stand upright or sit for at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1287">ADROVANCE is only available with water (not with mineral water) at least 30 minutes before the first meal, drink or intake of medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.</seg>
<seg id="1288">The following pointers are to be followed closely to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and associated side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after the day of the day. • Patients should not chew the tablet or let the tablet dissolve in the mouth as there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcera. • Patients should not sit down before the first meal of the day, which is to take 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract, except pyloroplasty, should only be given special care (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal lines, were reported in patients taking Alendronate (partially these were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">Therefore, the doctor should pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible bad reactions, and patients should be pointed out, in the occurrence of symptoms of esophageal irritation such as dysphagie, pain in swallowing or retrostaral pain or new or worsening heartburn the medicine (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe esophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical studies with alendronat no increased risk was detected, stomach and duodenal ulcera, among them some severe and with complications, were rarely reported (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteonnecrosis of the jaw, usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection (including osteomyelitis), has been reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimens include intravenously administered bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available to indicate whether the treatment of bisphosphonate therapy in patients needing a surgical procedure reduces the risk of osteonnecrosis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">The clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning of each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet next morning when consuming a dose of ADROVANCE after they have noticed their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but take one tablet a week as originally planned for the planned day of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be adequately treated before starting therapy with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and drinks (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines can affect the resorption of alendronate if taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Patients must therefore wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies have not been conducted, alendronate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clinically relevant interactions occurring.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for the application of postmenopausal women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy that recognize embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteonnecrosis of the jaw was reported in patients with bisphosphonates; most of the reports stem from cancer patients, but also osteoporosis was reported.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus-Talking are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraph to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post-transplant period.</seg>

<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - switch from Prograf to Advagraph must be converted to a transplant recipient of twice daily dose of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of advance, so this changeover has to take place in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After a change from other immunosuppressant drugs to advance, the treatment must begin with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation for prophylaxis of transplant rejection.</seg>

<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with impaired liver function In order to maintain blood levels in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver dysfunctions.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with impaired renal function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the kidney function (including a regular definition of serum creatinine levels, a calculation of the creatinol and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin to Advagraph When switching from a Ciclosporine to a tacrolimus-based therapy caution is advised (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases using full blood tacrolimus-tallow controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the Tacrolimus-Talking during the first two weeks following transplant followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-Talking of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to advance, dose adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could change the tacrolimus full blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraph is a medicine with a low clearance, adaptations of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the level of sebum in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the levels of tacrolimus in full blood in the first time after liver transplantation are usually in the range from 5 - 20 ng / ml and for kidney and heart transplant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During subsequent maintenance of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the area of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects that may occur as a result of tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; reformations of the formulation or regime should only be performed under the narrow-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplantation recipients, no clinical data are yet available for the retarded formulation Advent.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), or other plant remedies should be avoided during a treatment with advance (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus levels is offered in the blood, as the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases a hypertrophy called cardiomyopathy was observed under Prograf, which can therefore also occur under Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, fluid overload and oedema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light should be limited due to the potential risk of maligned skin lesions due to suitable clothing or use of a solar control with a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the rise in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 may affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase the level of hormone exposure, it is particularly cautious in decisions about contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal tests have shown that tacrolimus may potentially reduce the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and extend their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients do not indicate that under tacrolimus in comparison to other immunosuppressant drugs there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, monitoring of the newborn to possible adverse effects of tacrolimus (in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1460">There is a risk of premature birth (&lt; Week 37) and a Hyperkalemia of the newborn (incidence 8 of 111 newborns, i.e.:</seg>
<seg id="1461">The side effect profile of immunosuppressants can often not be determined precisely because of the patient's disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1462">The side effects after their frequency are listed in descending order: very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, ≤ 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, ≤ 1 / 1,000), very rare (≤ 1 / 10,000, ≤ 1 / 1,000), very rare (≤ 1 / 10.000, not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>

<seg id="1466">Cases of virus-associated Nephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients with immunosuppression therapy, including therapy with advance.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Benign or malignant neoplasties including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumors in combination with the treatment with tacrolimus were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma roteins can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialysiable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mode of action and pharmacodynamic effects At the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus are mediated by its binding to a cytosolitic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cell innards.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent suspension of signal transduction pathways in the T cell, preventing the transcription of a certain number of lymphoid genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus oppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of the B cells, depending on T-helper cells, and the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1481">175 lung transplanted patients, with 475 patients undergoing a pancreatic transplantation, and in 630 cases were used as primary immunosuppressant in 630 cases.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral Prograf in these published studies corresponded to the observations of the large studies in which Prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multicenter study with oral Prograf, more than 110 patients received either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin within 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">In the first year after the transplant, chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterative syndrome, was less frequently observed after the transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus- and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with Tacrolimus, the incidence of a bronchiolitis obliterans in 21.7% was compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be changed to Tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients enforced by tacrolimus on Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was greater after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in lung transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus Group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In a study, the frequency of the genesis of a bronchiolitis obliterative syndrome was significantly lower in the patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreas Transplantation A multicentre study with oral Prograf was conducted to 205 patients who were simultaneously undergoing a pancreatic and kidney transplantation undergoing a randomised procedure Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initialdose (by protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the desired level of sebum from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Colon transplantation The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prograf as primary immunosuppressant after intestinal transplants showed a current survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) and CMV infections, bone marrow augmentation, additional administration of the interleukin-2 antagonist Daclizumab, lower starting doses of Tacrolimus, which lead to sebaceous reflection between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplant radiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low hematocrit and low protein concentrations which lead to an increase in the missing faction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism caused by the treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby excretion takes place mainly via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advagraph was approximately 10% lower than Prograf in case of stable patients treated by Prograf (twice daily) at a rate of 1: 1 (mg: mg).</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advocates are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether advocates are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced using a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced that enables it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">"" "" "" "advocate is similar to another drug called rebinate, which is approved in the European Union, but is made differently, so that the drug does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin." ""</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of implants in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood sepals was "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies vis-à-vis factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advocates may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human clotting factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit for the placing of Advocate in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, the place and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not drop below the specified plasma levels (in% of the standard or I.U. / dl) during the corresponding period.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat all 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years), until the risk is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, the dose and frequency of the injections are recommended to control the dose and frequency of the injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A, doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg of body weight should be given at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not achieved or if the bleeding with an appropriate dose is not mastered, a test must be carried out to prove an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The administration speed should be directed to the patient, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against Factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the procoagulatory activity of Factor VIII immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, where the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 Expositional days and anamnestic-known inhibitors development, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (low-tipped) inhibitors was observed.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since initial approval, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP on the basis of the ADVATE safety profile, which makes a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for further extensions over the next 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited approved the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company withdraws its application for authorisation for the marketing of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissue that connects, surrounds and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advocin is a "Adenovirus," which has been modified so that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus can cause no infection in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advocin would have been injected directly into the tumors, allowing the cancer cells to rebuild the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the p53 gene present in the human body, usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In case of Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li-Fraumeni cancer in the area of subconstruction, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP tested the company's answers to the questions he asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initial submitted documents, the CHMP generates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advocin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore has advantages for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Furthermore, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that AdvExin can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who are in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know the CHMP if the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or "compassionate use" programs with Advexuin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aeropaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, nasal infections caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and teenagers aged 12 or over, the recommended dose of aerosaze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with or without food entirely with a glass of water.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cluttered.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be traced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main impact measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, the patients recorded their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay symptoms except constipation of the nose, the patients receiving aerosaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients under aeropaze showed a relief of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who only received desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aeropaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), dryness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aeropaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic substances or Loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aeropaze may not be used in patients suffering from a narrow-angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroidosis), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyrosis) or a hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the placing of Aerinaze on the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aeropaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after symptoms of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days, as long-term use can decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper airways the treatment can be continued with desloratadin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since aeropaze contains pseudoephedrine, the drug is contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergoid, tin oxide, Cabergolin, ergotamine, Dihydrogenotamine or other deongestiva that are peroral or nasally as abovaries of Rhinology (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient collective and the data does not suffice to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aeropaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suffice to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treating hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, heart rhythm disorders, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or intensification of headaches) must be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with cardiac arrhythmias • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder holdings or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aeropaze is at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, since antihistaminika can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">However, as part of clinical trials with desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadin and placebo-treated patients regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the loratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The safety of the use of aeropaze during pregnancy is not assured, but experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerosaze should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a presumption that may result in impairment of transport capacity or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremolor, convulsions) with possible letteral processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precordial pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is most likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupil stiffness and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the suspension of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human body cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the Adhesive molecule P selector on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance, including amplification of subjective sleepiness or tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis took part, with 414 patients receiving aeropaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine-antagonistic efficacy of aeropaze tablets was significantly higher compared to the overall results for the symptoms (besides nasal mucosa swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine during the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aeropaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aeropaze tablets showed no significant differences in patient sub-groups with regard to gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study for pharmacokinetics of aeropaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aeropaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow equilibrium of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the framework of a pharmacokinetic multiple dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects, it has been established that four volunteers underwent bad metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the exclusive gift of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was to exposure after gift of an aerosaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated doses, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin does not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">The pharmaceutical vigilance system described in module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to alleviating allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's substance, to unfold its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aeropaze tablets relieve symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) such as sneezing, running or itchy nose and drowning or cheering eyes while constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if the following symptoms or conditions occur or diagnosed with you under the use of aeropaze: • High blood pressure • Heart chase, palpitations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headaches or strengthening existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you are taking Aerinaze with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Use in the recommended dosage is not to be expected that aeropaze will lead to lightheadedness or the attention is reduced.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin was reported very rarely about cases of severe allergic reactions (respiratory, whistling breath, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rashes.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart hunting, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, lightheadedness, sleep disorders, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, about cases of inflammation of the liver and about cases of conspicuous liver values has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablet, 5 mg of lyophilic (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg and 5 mg fusion tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once daily, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or 5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by identifying the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrant, impairment of sleep and performance of the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to enter and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application of children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies have been taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average reduction in the scores (scores) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urticaria, the decrease in the scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% was compared to 40 and 33% compared to placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, loratadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous illness expiration and may be terminated after the symptoms end and when re-occurrences are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In case of persistent allergic rhinitis (symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks), patients may be recommended during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can be assumed that it can lead to impairment of transport capacity or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical studies in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly reported adverse events reported in placebo were tiredness (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches, this occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and at 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study that was administered up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the suspension of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human body cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the Adhesive molecule P selector on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses that were administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study in which Desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, there was no longer an extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance, including the amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis may also be classified depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis are defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis are defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the basis of the overall quality of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria has been studied for further forms of urticaria as the underlying pathophysiology, notwithstanding the etiology of different forms, is similar and chronic patients can be recruited simple prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histaminfestation is a causative factor in all urticarial diseases, it is expected that in addition to chronic idiopathic urticaria, desloratadin also leads to an improvement in symptoms even in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of preitus and the reduction of size and number of squadls at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the majority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement of the itch by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin in comparison to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and alertness significantly, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study, in which the patient demos were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant cumulating after a daily application of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines will not be completely ruled out</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with a loratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, rich and rich in calories) did not affect the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies performed with Desloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin do not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Colorless film (contains lactose monohydrate, Hypromess, Titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmin (E 132)), colorless film (contains Hypromlos, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, bleached wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescriber should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolise Desloratadin and experience a higher substance weight (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years of age, which is fully metabolized, is identical with that of children who metabolise normally.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose-isomaltas- insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study the effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Syrup-Group, similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between the ages of 1 and 11, who were eligible for antihistamine therapy, received a daily total dose of 1,25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin are similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which Desloratadin was administered over 14 days a day in a dosage of up to 20 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was used in a dose of 45 mg daily (the neonfold of the clinical dose) over ten days in adults, no longer showed an extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day for adults and adolescents there was no increased incidence of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">In a single daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies did not interfere with psychomotor disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1780">Clinical pharmacological studies of adults did not result in an increase in drowsiness due to the concurrent consumption of alcohol either to amplify alcohol-induced performance impairment or increase drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As shown on the basis of the overall quality of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of preitus and the reduction of size and number of squadls at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this constrained phenotype was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations greater in black (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with the syrup formulation of children aged 2 to 11 years with allergic rhinitis that are fully metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The loading (AUC) by Desloratadin was approximately 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the Cmax for about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications of clinically relevant drug accumulation after a daily application of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single dose studies, AUC and Cmax values of desloratadin were comparable in the recommended doses with those of adults who received desloratadin syrup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1789">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="1812">The overall frequency of the side effects of the disloratadine syrup and placebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile detected in adult patients.</seg>
<seg id="1813">At the recommended dose, the Aerius melting tablet proved to be bioequivalent to the Aerius 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the Aerius 5 mg lyophilic to the declining formulation of desloratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1815">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance, including amplification of subjective sleepiness or tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The spread of this poorly-metabolizing phenotype was comparable to adult (6%) and pediatric patients between 2 and 11 years (6%), and among blacks (adults 18%, children 16%) greater than with Caucasians (adults 2%, children 3%), however, the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population.</seg>
<seg id="1817">In individual-dose-crossover studies of Aerius melting tablet with Aerius 5 mg of conventional tablets or Aerius 5 mg Lyophiliacs, formulations were bioequivalent.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Aerius 2.5 mg tablets were not investigated in pediatric patients, but in connection with the dose-finding studies in children, however, pharmacokinetic data for Aerius melt tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. announced the official approval of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company withdraws its application for the launch of Aflunov for the prevention of the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new tribe of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from human to human because people have no immunity (no protection) on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="1897">Once the vaccine is administered, the immune system recognises the part of the flu virus in the vaccine as a "foreign body" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This means that the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies quicker in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane layer of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognises as foreign), was purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years, which are infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) causing the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution for intake, but it cannot be taken together with kritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined which antiviral medicines the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood of the virus will respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of kritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase decreases the HIV-quantity in the blood in combination with other antiviral medicines and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">"" "" "" "not to cure AIDS, however, can delay damage to the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS." ""</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 infected adults who previously had not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The medicine Agenerase enhanced with low dosed ritonavir was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who had previously taken protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the alteration of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who had previously not taken a protease inhibitor, after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but with the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, only very few responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the medicine Agenerase enhanced with Ritonavir decreased the viral load after 16-week treatment as well as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it came under Agenerase together with Ritonavir to strengthen the viral load after four weeks as in the patients who continued their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (nausea), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amponavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may not be used in patients who use St. John's wort (an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines that are broken down in the same way as Agenerase and are used in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, people who take Agenerase are the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in body fat distribution), osteonecrosis (loss of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children treated with protease inhibitors outweigh the risks over four years.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee noted that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with kritonavir in patients who previously had no protease inhibitor is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited an approval for the launch of Agenerase across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -pre-treated adults and children from 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Normally, Agenerase capsules should be given to pharmacokinetic boosting of amponavir together with low doses of kritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amponavir should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and pre-treatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution for intake is 14% lower than by Amprenavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution for intake on a milligram per milligram base are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of amponavir twice daily together with 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are used without the increased addition of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of kritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not investigated in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver function disorders at 300 mg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be taken with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic breadth and also represent the substrate of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amponavir during the intake of amponavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Normally, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral therapy combination have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing hepatic function including chronic hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids, which are metabolized via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic cortical eroider effects including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Normalized Ratio), methods are available for determination of the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take this medicine at the same time, Agenerase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amponavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with amponavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadone is given at the same time with amponavir, patients should therefore be supervised on ompiate symptoms, especially if also low doses of Ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propyl-lycoloration of the Agenerase solution for intake, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient populations.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set to 5, if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases requiring medication to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemolytic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase of haemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haematoma occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise at the time of initiating an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multi-factorial etiology is adopted (including use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher Body Mass Index), cases of osteonecrosis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4-Substrate with low therapeutic width Agenerase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic breadth and also represent the substrate of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with kritonavir may not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly metabolized via CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% shrinkage of the AUC of Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to balance the degraded plasma levels by means of a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with ritonavir, unwanted effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amponavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already uses St. John's wort, the amponavirals are and, if possible, check the virus load and remove the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if Nelfinavir is administered together with amponavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, for Cmax however, reduced by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amponavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies, doses of 600 mg of amponavir were used twice a day and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily to substantiate the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if amponavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg kritonavir twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma, which were reached in combination of amponavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if amponavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg kritonavir is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendations for simultaneous administration of amponavir and caletra cannot be given, but it is recommended to be closely monitored, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study carried out in combination with didanosin, but due to the fantasy component of Didanosin, it is recommended that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenerase lie at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amponavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required in combination with amponavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amponavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that nevirapin potentially lowers the serum concentration of amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs are to be used at the same time, caution is advisable because Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is required; thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be carried out as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amponavir and kritonavir on delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amponavir and rifabutin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193%, resulting in a rise in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction of the dosage of rifabutin should be at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data exists.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of the Cmax of ketoconazol in plasma around 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to the 2,69fold compared to the value observed once a day without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors, or induction of CYP3A4, may cause interactions, if they are used together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as Agenerase as it may lead to erectile dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulant drugs known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amponavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, Felodipine, Israelipin, Nicola pin, nifedipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine and anapamil can be increased.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake of apgenerase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and amplify the side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors, including hypotension, blurred vision and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial, in which Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice a day with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days of test subjects, the fluorasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous dose of Agenerase with Ritonavir together with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are pronounced increases in plasma levels while administration of Agenerase is expected.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of these drugs with amponavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations until stabilization of the mirrors is recommended, as the plasma concentrations of Cyclosporine, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amponavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase should not be used together with oral myozolam (see section 4.3) while at the same time it is advisable to use parenteral midazolam with care.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Midazolam around the 3 to 4-fache.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is administered together with amponavir, patients should therefore be supervised on ompiate symptoms, especially if also low doses of Ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation is currently available on how to adjust the amponavir dose if amponavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, increased control of the INR (International Normalized Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended with simultaneous apitalisation (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In milk lactating rats, amponavir-related substances have been detected, but it is not known whether Amprenavir exceeds breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the nesting in the uterus to the end of the breast feeding time ampprenavir, showed a decreased increase in the 12 body weight during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of amponavir to the dam.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenerase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early and rarely lead to a treatment interruption.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events are not clarified whether they are in connection with the use of Agenerase or another medicine used at the same time, or whether they are a result of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg Agenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and fetal subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral adipose tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsoccally fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non-treated individuals who had been treated with amponavir in combination with lamivudine / cidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (stitching) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 in 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients with amponavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopapulous nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonecrosis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">At the time of initiating an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop in HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pretreated patients who received 600 mg Agenerase twice a day together with low dosed ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of side effects (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory alterations (Grade 3 and 4) were similar to those observed in patients who received Agenerase together with low dosed kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosing, the patient is to observe signs of an intoxiation (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral Gag- and gag-pol- polyphenols with the result of a formation of unripe, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemp concentration (IC50) of amponavir lies in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and is 0,41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral previously untreated patients with the currently approved fossils / ritonavir dosages - as with other ritonavir treated treatment schemes with proteaseinhibitors - the described mutations rarely were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen out of 434 anti-retroviral previously untreated patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of kritonavir twice daily in the study ESS100732, a virological failure lasted until week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within 59 patients with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, M46I / L, I54L / M / T / V, Q58E, D60E, I62A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg kritonavir twice daily: n = 107) with patients treated with protease inhibitors occurred in patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic analysis systems based on genotypic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of amponavir / kritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, L33F, M36I, I52V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M in combination with increased phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir and a reduced likelihood of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analysing the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems based on phenotypic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amponavir / kritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (separation points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four associated with reduced sensitivity to amponavir creates a certain cross-resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remain generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross-resistance between amponavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five anti-retroviral previously untreated patients with which a Fosamprenavir (containing a resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir at the start of treatment and another against tipranavir), Indinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 insulates), indinavir / kritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), saquinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates) appear.</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other proteasepase-resistant isolates; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early departure of a therapy is recommended to prevent the accumulation of a variety of mutations, which can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which with PI pretreated adults after virological failure (Virusload ≥ 1000 copies / ml) either Agenerase (600 mg twice daily) and Nucleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-one (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-inferiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-sublevel threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbiased Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase was used twice a day, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg a day, and 22.5 mg / kg twice a day, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dose was given at the same time; the majority of previously untreated patients had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of the patients included in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the expected benefit of" "" "unbiased" "" "Agenerase should be considered when optimizing therapy with PI pretreated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">According to oral administration the mean duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of ampprenavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% raised, for Cmax on the other hand lowered by 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with ampprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amponavir with a meal leads to a 25% decline in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amponavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be connected to a large distribution volume and an unimpeded penetration of amponavir from the blood stream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in plasma, with the amount of unbound amponavir that represents the active portion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amponavir remains constant, the percentage of the free active component fluctuates during the dosing interval in dependence on the total drug concentration in the Steady State over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or represent a substrate of CYP3A4 need to be administered with caution when given at the same time with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, results in a similar daily amponavir exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is made from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore Agenerase solution and Agenerase Capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram-basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of a kidney function disorder should be low to the elimination of amponavir and kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to amponavir plasma levels comparable to those who are reported to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg amprenavir twice a day without simultaneous administration of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with amponavir in mice and rats, hepatellular adenomas were encountered in male animals in dosages, which correspond to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- times (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">From the actual exposure data to humans, both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application, there was little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in vitro genotoxicity tests that included bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames-Test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel test on rats and chromosome aberrations on human peripheral lymphocytes, amponavir was neither mutagen nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in the clinical routine by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Previously no significant liver toxicity was observed in clinical studies, neither during the administration of apgenerase after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals treated at the age of 4 showed a high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly lower (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus navigation and minor skeletal changes were observed, indicating delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are used without the increased addition of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be taken with caution in patients with weak or slight liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma, which were reached in combination of amponavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if amponavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg kritonavir is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendations for simultaneous administration of amponavir and caletra cannot be given, but it is recommended to be closely monitored, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amponavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these drugs are used together, caution is required; thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be carried out as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amponavir and kritonavir on delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction of the dosage of rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose is advised, although no clinical data exists.</seg>

<seg id="2077">In a clinical trial, in which Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice a day with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days of test subjects, the fluorasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, increased control of the INR (International Normalized Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg Ethinyl lestradiol plus 1.0 mg Norethindron) led to a decrease in the AUC and Cmin of Amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2187">Apply Imiquimod cream in a thin layer and rub in the cleaned, infected skin area, until the cream is completely absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2188">It should take place in these patients between the benefit of treatment with Imiquimod and the risk associated with a possible worsening of their autoimmune disease.</seg>
<seg id="2189">It should be weighed in these patients between the benefit of treatment with Imiquimod and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or graft versus host reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2190">In other studies, in which no daily prehemogiene was performed, two cases of severe phimosis and a case were observed with a knitted lining leading to circumcision.</seg>
<seg id="2191">In rare cases, severe local skin irritation (see section 4.2.) In rare cases severe local skin irritation has been observed, which necessitated a treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impairment.</seg>
<seg id="2192">In cases where such reactions occurred at the outlet of the urethra, some women had difficulties with urination that necessitated an emergency catheterisation and treatment of the affected area.</seg>
<seg id="2193">For the application of Imiquimod cream immediately following a treatment with other cutaneous uses applied to the treatment of external tendencies in the genital and perianage range, no clinical experience has yet occurred.</seg>

<seg id="2195">The treatment of basal cell carcinoma with Imiquimod within 1 cm around the eyelids, the nose, the lips or the hairline was not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are frequent, but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after conclusion of treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to the patient's discomfort or because of the severity of local skin reactions, a treatment period may be made several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">As there is currently no data available about long-term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment, other suitable therapy forms should be considered in superficial basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">In patients with relapsed and pre-treated BCCs, there are no clinical experiences, therefore the application of pre-treated tumours is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study suggest that large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2) have a lower likelihood of response to Imiquimod therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not examined for the treatment of actin keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the application of imiquimod for the treatment of actin keratoses in anatomical places outside the face and the scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinical keratose on the forearms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions normally decrease over the course of the therapy to intensity or go back after the treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong, treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">From the data of an open clinical trial, patients with more than 8 ac- lesions showed a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties, Imiquimod Cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although the serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) can neither be quantified after a one-off nor after multiple topical application, no recommendation can be given to the application during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most frequently communicated and probably or possibly with the application of Imiquimod cream in related side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of the Feignizen (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most common side effects reported and probably or possibly with the application of Imiquimod cream in related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The basalion patients treated by 185 with Imiquimod-cream from a placebo-controlled clinical study of phase III reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common side effect, probably or possibly with the application of Imiquimod cream in connection with the application, was a reaction to the application site (22% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">Adverse events indicated by 252 in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials with imiquimod-cream treated patients with actin keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The clinical signs provided according to the test plan show that these placebo-controlled clinical trials often result in local skin reactions including Erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excreation / flattening / shed (23%) and oedema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">This evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these trials with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream very often result in severe erysubjects (31%), severe erosions (13%), and serious scarring and scarring (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies investigating the use of imiquimod for the treatment of actin keratose, alopecia was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment center or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadvertent oral absorption of 200 mg Imiquimod, which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically most severe side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, was in hypotonia normalized after oral or intravenous hydration.</seg>
<seg id="2221">A pharmacokinetic examination showed increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interferons and other cytokines following the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies it was possible to demonstrate that efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the cowl in an imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of the patients treated with Imiquimod, the patients were completely healed; this was the case with 20% of the patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod over 6 weeks in five times was examined in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superintentional basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients had been clinically healed and that remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic ac- lesions within a cohesive 25 cm2 area of treatment on the unhairy scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical symptoms after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications External lips, actin keratose and Supermodial basal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was examined in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or ≤ 16 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of the 5% Imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actin keratosis was observed in the three weekly application for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bags), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated apparent half-life time was approximately 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after the subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this points to an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of imiquimod following topical application on MC-diseased skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with actin keratose or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on the dermal toxicity of the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased milz weight; a study conducted for the dermal application for four months did not reveal similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice on three days a week did not induce tumours in the field of application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low system absorption of the human skin and is not mutagen, a risk for the human being due to systemic exposure is considered to be very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active ingredient-free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a safe diagnosis of Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) cannot be broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints that complicate movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">Administration of Aldurazyme should take place at a hospital or clinic with revitalization equipment, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly investigates the safety of the drug, but it also measured its effectiveness (by examining its effect on the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), feeling of heat, fever and reactions at the infusion place.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measure size of pulmonary function), tachycardia (expedited heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be strongly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other ingredients (anaphylactic reaction), not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2282">Each year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all the new information that may be known, and where necessary update it.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will see patients receiving aldurazyms in regard to the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Genzyme Europe B.V. for the introduction of Aldurazyme in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, egg stock of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with a safe diagnosis of Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be done by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms in adults over 65 years has not been established, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effects that occur during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only take place in a reasonable clinical setting, in which resuscitation facilities are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">As a result of the clinical phase 3 study, almost all patients form IgG antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction have to be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience in the recovery of treatment after a longer interruption, the risk of hypersensitivity after an interruption of treatment has to be cautiously avoided due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2296">Pretreatment 60 minutes before the start of infusion with medications (antihistaminika and / or antipyretics) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a slight or moderate infusion reaction, the treatment with antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate at which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquine or procaine because there is a potential risk of interferenz with the intracellular intake of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not have direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy that include embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns that have been exposed to breast milk over breast milk are present, it is recommended to not breastfeed with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were classified as infusion-related responses, which were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older, are listed in the following table according to the following frequencies: very frequently (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre-history, severe reactions also occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing stops and facial oedema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug effects associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly severe progression-form and a duration of treatment up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients had a serokonversion within 3 months after the commencement of the treatment, with a more severe form of treatment within a month of 5 years (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or until a premature departure from the study), there were no detectable antibodies in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) assay, including 3 patients in which it never came to server version.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with missing to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of GAG spegs in the urine, while in patients with high antibodies a variable reduction of GAG in the urine was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro that seemed to affect clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies does not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the incidence of adverse drug reactions was typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is one for the hydrolysis of accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulatory system and is absorbed by cells in the lysosomes, most likely via the body of manna-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients ranging from 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were of the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an forced expiratory volume (FeV) of less than 80% of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FeV and the absolute path in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study, where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed improvement of lung function and the ability to gait that is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the expected percentage FeV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volumina increased proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) until the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease in GAG levels was found in the urine (µg / mg of creatinin), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account clinically significant changes for five efficacy variables (expected percentage normal FeV, distance in 6 minutes walking distance, range of shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted, which mainly investigates the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age in the study (16 patients with the severe form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- mirror in urine in week 22 over the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) were determined according to the Z score for this age group The younger patients with the severe lead form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed normal mental development speed, whereas in older patients with severe progression form only limited or no progress in cognitive development were to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacogenic effects of various aldurazyme dosing regimens were conducted on the GAG levels in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks may represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate all new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in a unique application, toxicity in repeated administration and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2336">Since no compatibility studies have been carried out, this drug may not be mixed with other medicines, except those listed under 6.6.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another medicine for cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (medicine against cancer) and "maligne" (vicious - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) and is likely to spread slightly to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as a sole treatment in patients who have not yet been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should receive a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during the treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, an additional "anti-salt" (medicine against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent dehydration) should be given before or after the gift of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood is altered or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, reduced or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of telemetremixed thus slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetreindexed into its active form can be easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer term of active cancer in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural tube, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another anti-cancer drug), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1,725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin lived on an average of 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months at the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months with docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">However, in both studies patients in which the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells, in the administration of Alimta longer lived longer than with the comparison medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the introduction of Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each water bottle must be dissolved with a 0,9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which gives a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary do- sis is taken from the flow bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for first-line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, except for predominantly high-epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with lo- kal advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, except for predominantly dissectional dissection epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is administered intravenously as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the conclusion of the pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small bronchial carcinoma after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered intravenously as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given on the day before and on the day of the telemetremixed administration as well as on the day after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of telemetremixed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the dose must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week before the first telemetremixed dose as well as after each third cycle of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive telemetremixed, a complete blood picture should be created before each gift, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocyte enumeration.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">A dose examination must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle, taking into consideration the neadir of the blood stream or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the preceding treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient receives the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA has to be canceled if in patients with 2 can reductio a hematological toxicirity or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs or so- continue in the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that in patients age 65 years of age or over 65 years of age, there is an increased risk of adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a creatinin clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with a creatinin clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin limit and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not studied especially in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to the immunosuppression and telemetremixed should not be administered to patients before their absolute number of neutrophils again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cyte number again a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrophal number, thrombocyte number and maximum non-haematological toxicity observed in previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 haematological and non-matological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with telemetremixed must be treated with folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure for the reduction of treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous intakes of nonsteroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days after therapy with pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients who have a therapy with telemetremixed must avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life time for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">In patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space, drainage of the effusion before the pemetremixed treatment is to be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical studies with telemetremixed occasionally when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccine is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible degradation of reproductive capacity by means of telemetremixed, men should be pointed out before the treatment procedure to obtain advice on the preservation of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">High doses of nonsteroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g per day) can result in reduced telemetremixed excretion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is advisable when using normal kidney function (Creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid can be used in high doses.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetremixed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">As there is no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous use of telemetremixed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetre- mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Normalized Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetremixed in pregnant women, but as with anaerobic antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetreindexed must not be used during pregnancy except if necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity is by means of telemetremixed, men should be advised before the start of treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether telemetremixes are transferred into breast milk and undesired effects in the breastfed baby cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomised Cisplatin and Pemetreindeer and 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomised to receive Cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetremixed) is an antineoplastic antitorat that exerts its effect by interrupting important metabolic processes that are necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that telemetremixed acts as an antitorat with several points of attack by blocking thymidylatsynthase (TS), Dihydrofolatreduction ase (DHFR) and glycoiribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), the folate-dependent key enzymes in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and Purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, simple-blind, Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin against cisplatin in chemonaive patients with a malignant pleural othelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically significant advantage of a survival compared to patients with chronic 2.8-months.</seg>

<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they cannot break down some fats in the diet, causing about a quarter of the fats fed with food undigested into the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study alli was compared to 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who took Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no loss of weight could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily stains at the anus, flatus (winch) with bowel movement, bowel movement, oily / oily chair, finish oily secretion (feces), Flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be applied to patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>

<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited an approval for placing orlistat GSK in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body Mass Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypocrative, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and youths under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since orlistat is only minimal resorption, the dosage is not necessary for older people and patients with impaired liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Premature treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.5) • Chronic Malabsorption syndrome • Cholestasis • Pregnancy (see section 4.6) • Early treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli because the dosage of the antidiabetic must be adapted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these drugs has to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-related measures to prevent the failure of the oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a reduction in the Ciclosporin plasma level was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants combined with orlistat, the Quick-Values (internationally normalized ratio, INR) could be influenced (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">For most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical studies up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as the beta-carotine were in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a complementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">At a limited number of healthy volunteers who received Orlistat at the same time, a minor decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed after the administration of a single dose of Amiodarone.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug, as absorption of taken-in fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known side effects detected after the market launch of orlistat is unknown, since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that the treatment with alli can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obese subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the launch of orlistat overdosing, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a rapid recovery of any systemic effects caused by the lipastime properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect sets in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active serum rest of the gastric and pankretic lipasen.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies have been derived from the fact that 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks the absorption of approximately 25% of the dietary fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies of adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 substantiate the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokaloric, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change of body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomization), was evaluated as follows: as a change of body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a proportion of those students who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average cholesterol in the total cholesterol was 60 mg / 2.4% (output value 5.20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (output value 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average LDL cholesterol decreased with orlistat 60 mg -3.5% (output value 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (output value 3.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (initial value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (output value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could only be detected sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without any signs of accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients who administered the minimum systemic resorbied dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after separation of the N-shaped leucine group), could be identified, representing approximately 42% of total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, canogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data cannot be identified as a particular hazard to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an anti-emplacement drug).</seg>
<seg id="2610">Patients under the age of 18 are not recommended because there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong and moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the strong cause of nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting (132 out of 223) compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate cause of nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 out of 191 patients).</seg>

<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in severely emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be increased by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colon massage, patients with anamnestial obstipation or signs of a subacute inlet should be monitored closely following the injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is offered with simultaneous administration of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with another chemotherapy regimen, Aloxi is not to be used in the days following chemotherapy to prevent or prevent nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five studied chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of palonosetron and a Steady State- Concentration of oral metocloplamids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population based pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 induction (dexamethasone and rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (amodarone, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, haloperidol, ritonavir, sertraline and terbinafine) had no significant impact on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the application of palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common side effects observed at a dose of 250 micrograms (633 patients), which were at least possibly associated with Aloxi, were headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the location (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage similar frequency of adverse events occurred as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-effectiveness relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Dialysis studies have not been carried out, but due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for alopia overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients were given a moderate emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1.500 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and 25mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide (half-life time 4 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-life 7.3 hours), which was given intravenously to day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared with patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarised in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The objective of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG effects of I.V. administered palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-life of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dosed in the entire dose range of 0.- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma concentration in 11 testicular cancer patients was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of palonosetron was comparable to the value measured after a one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax was higher after the intake of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and about 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on metabolism, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unchanged ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">The total body of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min was achieved after a single intravenous injection injection.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal eliminations time and the average systemic exposure with palonosetron increased, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified by this.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical studies there were indications that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and can prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose corresponded to about 30x of the therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased incidence of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal mark) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high doses used and since Aloxi is determined by humans for unique application, the relevance of these results is assessed as low for the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report in which the approval of the Medicines Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution provided for the treatment of hepatitis C was approved.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same medicinal effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference medicinal products" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination, liver tissue damage indicates damage, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) are elevated in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">Yeast produces a gene in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active substance structure, composition and purity of the medicine, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed does not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C responding to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After hiring the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was again present in more patients than with the reference medicinal product; Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug causes an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug) are not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat Impetigo (skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected infirs (crack or cutting), abrasions and sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by amicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because alarms may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients aged nine months, but patients under the age of 18 may not exceed 2% of the surface of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin dogs, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together in skin wound, approximately 90% of patients of both groups responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, Altargo has not been effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Altargo have outweighed the risks of short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, infected small infirs, abrasions or sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Ltd. for the market launch of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement in two or three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of sensitization or serious local irritation by the use of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment is canceled, the ointment carefully wiped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection will begin.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections where MRSA is known as a pathogen or is suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of secondary infected open wounds, the efficacy of Retapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or worsening of the infected place occurs after a 2 to 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of Retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the small plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on scratched skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 According to an oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg Ketoconazole, the mean Retapamulin EC (0-24) and Cmax for topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe increased by 81% on a weakened skin of healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adjustments are not considered necessary when topical retriapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral ingestion and are inadequate in relation to a statement affecting the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy when a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Retapamulin is preferable to a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding continues / terminated or the treatment with Altargo should be continued / terminated, it is to weigh between the benefit of nursing for the infant and the benefit of Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections which used Altargo, the most common side effect was irritation at the date of the administration, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulis is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Clitopilus passwort erianus (formerly Pleurotus passwort erianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial reef, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site is involved in the ribosomales protein L3 and is located in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Binding on this binding site inhibits peptide transfer, block partial P binding sites, and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If due to the local prevalence of resistance the use of Retapamulin appears questionable in at least some types of infection, advice should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences were found in the in vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to treat S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sample collection took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake in humans after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 of reduced skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / h / ml) 660-times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP-inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism of the in vitro oxidative metabolsm in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro screening on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphooma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rat microkernel test for in-vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, whereby up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure in humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of scratched skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats were found at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved once the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix can only be used if there is low risk of hepatitis B infection while immunisation is low and it is ensured that the vaccination plan can be completed from two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is requested against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"" "vaccines work by" "" "teach" "" "the immune system (the body's natural defense) as it can defend itself against a disease." ""</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the virus and surface antigens as" "" "foreign" "" "and produces antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccine Twinrix Adult, which has been approved since 1996, and the vaccine Twinrix allowed since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, Twinrix Adults and Twinrix are administered as part of a three-dose vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix Adult contain identical ingredients, some of the data supporting the application of Twinrix Adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month period and a 12 month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children, Ambirix led a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar in a six-month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, mating (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission issued GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for priming up with Ambirix is made up of two doses of vaccines. the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster dose is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, it is possible to vaccinate with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HV) antibodies observed after a basic dimming with the combination vaccine are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons who have responded to a hepatitis A vaccine need a booster shot as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory even in no more detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection-vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360-ELISA units form-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hematalysis patients and people with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies after priming, so that in these cases the administration of further vaccines may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal success, these injection methods should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in the case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix can be injected subcutanally, as in these cases, intramuscular administration may lead to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined mask mumps-mumps vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that there may be no adequate response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, mating, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever is comparable to the frequency observed in earlier thiomercial and preservative vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccine doses were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years, Ambirix was compared with the 3-doses combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a basis of calculation per dose of Ambirix, but not on a basis of calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% in the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 doses combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects administered by the Ambirix were about pain, compared to 63.8% among the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-can combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of mating was comparable to a proband (i.e. about 39.6% of the subjects receiving Ambirix compared to 36.2% in the subjects receiving the 3-doses combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of severe pain and fatigue was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-doses vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year vaccination, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambiani group was comparable to that which was observed in administration with the 3-doses combination vaccine with 360-ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6 to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported serious side effects during the 2-doses vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted in vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the serum conversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted between 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">For the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was worthless, the seroprotectants (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3-can vaccine significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11-year-olds one month after the completion of the full vaccine series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">Both studies received either a 2-doses-vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-doses-vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360-ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were aged between 12 and 15 years at the time of priming, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after the immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunreaction observed in this study against both antigens was comparable to those detected after vaccination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial between 12- and including 15-year-old could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is similar 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme is comparable to that in the 0-12 month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the absorption chimination of a combined diphtheria-, tetanus, azellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined mask mumps-mumps vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data that has become known since the issuance of the first authorization for placing on the market, the CHMP assumed that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was placed in traffic only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammol can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammoor is divided into several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastrostomieship (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, since ampaps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a pseudo drug, i.e. without active agent).</seg>

<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonola was approved in" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval, limited information about this drug was available." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, in which a complete enzyme shortage already manifests in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first month of life), there is then an indication of the use if a hyperammonia encephalopathy in the anamnesis exists.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow or swallow tablets, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake required for the patient's growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">For patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithinic acid, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required at a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatsynthetase deficiency have to obtain arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swallowing as there is a risk for the formation of esophagulcera when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, respectively 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and eye formation.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), a slowdown of neuronal propagation and increased loss of neurons occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a decreased number of functioning nerve endings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in the mother's milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at least one adverse event (AE) occurred in 56% of patients and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported from an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactate dosis, severe hypoglycaemia, artery neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred with a 5-month-old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity for intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound that conjugates to phenylacetylglutamine by acetylated glutamine which is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stoichometrically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients suffering from disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium phenylbutyrate between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine can be produced.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the earliest manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infectious and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment of peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through hematalysis, the exploitation of alternative routes of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzene and sodium phenyl acetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn babies at postpartal (however within the first months of life) diagnosed diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonia cephalopathy, survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it was time for many people with mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Survival rate was 98% in patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygotic form of the Ornithinic AscarPillow deficiency), which were treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in the liver and kidneys with glutamine, and phenylacetylglutamine is created.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after administration of a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with urea cycle disorders, hemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also investigated in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form 15 minutes after ingesting measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary tract disturbances or hemoglobin opathies, phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day) was detectable in the next morning after a fast fast no phenylacetate in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis of the liver, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the average phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrate had no plaintive effects with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is either taken orally (infants and children, who cannot swallow a tablet, or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a gastrostomieship or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (particularly branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">For patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithinic acid, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required at a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, respectively 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat flutes were exposed to phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrate) before birth, lesions in the pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex came.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported from an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactate dosis, severe hypoglycaemia, artery neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Stoichometrically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of surplus</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with urea cycle disorders can be assumed that for each gram, sodium phenylbutyrate between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine can be produced.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granular form 15 minutes after ingestion measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of no more than 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure the small measuring spoon is 0.95 g, the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring scoop 8.6 g of sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication by means of a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after the consumption of proteins.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example with unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stopping" (an anomalous measured value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients with a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of Angiox was compared with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient frequently used a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as Abciximab and Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without the administration of GPI - was as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks or reactivity) after 30 days or one year.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, Angiox in relation to all indicators was as effective as heparin, except for severe bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Bivalirudin, other hirudine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">The European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd in September 2004 for placing angiox on the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-proliferation infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in emergency intervention or if early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous infusion of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If there is another PCI in the patient, an additional minus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion can be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">In the immediate vicinity of the procedure, a joint of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angioxin in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intravenous infusion of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single bolus gift from Angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is reduced to less than 225 seconds, a second bolus input of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before use and the dose of the bolus dose is rapidly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min) that one PCI is subjected to (whether treated with Bivalirudin for ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolus dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolus dose to be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which resulted in approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bivalirudin-Bolus without dose adjustment on an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min), angiox is contraindicated in patients with dialysis (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after termination of the intravenous administration of unquestionable Heparin or 8 hours after ending the subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients must be carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if Bivalirudin is given in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if the majority of PCI-patients under Bivalirudin appear most bleedings at arterial point-points, patients with a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may undergo hemorrhages throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin, monitoring of the INR value (International Normalized Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after settling the treatment with Bivalirudin again reaches the level before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanisms of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombocyte aggregations) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalidatine with thrombocyte aggregations or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostaseology parameters are checked regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal experimental studies are insufficient in terms of impact on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unquestionable heparin or enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">In both the Bivalirudin group and the comparisons treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to the ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleeding as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding performed significantly less frequently under Bivalirudin than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor plus GPIIb / IIIa- or inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy hemorrhage was defined as one of the following: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point of puncture that necessitated a radiological or surgical intervention of ≥ 3 g / dl of hemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with a well-known blood vessel, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed hemorrhages, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" puncture centres, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on adverse events is based on data from a clinical trial with a bivalidatdin in 6000 patients who underwent a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">In both the Bivalirudin group and the comparisons treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects not listed above have been reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are grouped together according to system organic classes in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, the treatment with Bivalirudin is immediately broken off and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thromatic inhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic center as well as in the anionic binding region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or at clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to thromboin, and with it its effect, is reversible, because thrombosis in turn regenerates the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active center of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalirudin with serum from patients in which it had occurred in the past to heparinduce thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) did not induce thrombocyte aggregation reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, Bivalirudin demonstrates a dose and concentration-dependent antikoagulatory effect, which is covered by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the following cases, an additional minus of 0.5mg / kg of Bivalirudin should be given and the infusion can be increased for the duration of the surgery to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unquestionable haparin or enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / Non-ST Healing infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomised to receive a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before the start of angiography (at the time of randomization) or with the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients who required angiography within 72 hours were equally distributed across the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had recurring ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG- changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and approximately 99% of all patients underwent a angiography within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and 1 year endpoint for the overall population (ITT) and for patients receiving aspirin and clopidolil according to protocol (before angiography or before the PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopidolil before angiography or prior to PCI 1 An ACUITY heavy hemorrhage was defined as one of the following: intracranial, retroperito-neale, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point of puncture, reducing the hemoglobin level of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood supply, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomized double-blind study involving more than 6,000 patients who underwent a PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as for patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudin as peptide goes through a catabolism into its amino acid constituents with subsequent reutilization of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolyte, which results from the split of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through thromboin, is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thromboin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Elimination occurs in patients with normal kidney function after a process of first order with a terminal half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks during an exposure up to 10-cases of the clinical steady-state plasma concentration) was limited to overshooting pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Side effects as a result of prolonged physiological stress in response to non-homeostatic coagulation were not observed after short-term exposure comparable to that in clinical application, even with very much higher dosage.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or upper arm or administered as a continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to control the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-lucisin is very slightly different from the human insulin, and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body is unable to produce insulin, in two studies involving a total of 1 549 adults and a study of 572 children between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In the case of type 2 diabetes, where the body is unable to work effectively, Apidra was examined in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed in six months compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin bounce.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin-lucilissin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of Apidra in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous injection through continuous infusion in the abdomen area.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Because of the reduced glucose levels and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin demand in patients with a restriction of liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of active strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or manufacturing method may result in a change in insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 inadequate dosage or termination of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these states are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Switching from one patient to another type of insulin or insulin of another manufacturer should be performed under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of the occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the effectiveness of the used insulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converters, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifyllin, propoxyphene, salizylates, and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the effects of sympathetic drugs such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserpin can be weakened or missing the symptoms of adrenergic counteracts.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin secrete enters into human breast milk, but in general insulin enters neither breast milk nor is it resorbed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">In the following, the adverse drug interactions known from clinical trials are grouped by system organclasses and arranged according to decreasing frequency of occurrence (very often: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, drowsiness, excessive dog-ger, changes in vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is foamed to continuously change injection area within the injection area, as a result lipodystrophy may occur at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemia with unconsciousness may be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous dosage of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose projection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the serious hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin-lulisine the effect occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin-lucilisine showed a low-level glucose-reducing effect in the therapeutic-relevant dosage range of 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg, and at 0,3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucose-reducing effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisine has a twice as fast impact as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosing effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was evident that a comparable postprandiale glycaemic control is achieved in an application of insulin-lulisine 2 minutes before the meal, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin-lucilisine was inherited 2 minutes before the meal, a better postpranal control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin-lucilisin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved, such as in human normal insulin, which is given 2 microns before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin-lucilisin in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before beginning of the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin-lucilisin at a dose of 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterward) after the start of the meal compared to human nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (figure 1C).</seg>
