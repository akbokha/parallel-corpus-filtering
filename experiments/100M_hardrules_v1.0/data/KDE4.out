the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions from &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier to use .
further information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose settings extensions ... Open the map card tools and select the desired modules .
this is a list of standard modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that if you have additional software installed , you may have more modules installed on your system .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click on Extras exit . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if available .
the View Filter module ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras View filters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed page . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ Item , all other nodes are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various toolbar and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in displaying ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . tree @-@ Maps allow representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the objects of a object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View , the size is the size of a file or folder , the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be detected even if it is far down in the folder hierarchy . consequently , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap @-@ representation a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rectang@@ les have useful color geb@@ anding and labelling settings .
the color of a rectangle that is switched over view color mode can display either depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectangle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space for representation , or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rectang@@ les should be used ( whereby , consequently , representation errors occur by constraints on the sign of the tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle .
for Tre@@ em@@ aps for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target will not always be comp@@ lied with . it will draw frames to prevent the ne@@ sting of entries , and those frames need space that will then be lost to the subordin@@ ate entries if the rectangle is square .
how to split the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this context , it is always advantageous for cap@@ tion and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frames to create rectang@@ les that are as square as possible . the best methods on this are rows , columns or recur@@ sive divisions .
you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry view View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
you can find the picture gallery in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras View picture gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
when you view the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens which allows you to set the image of the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tit@@ le of the page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field . &quot; &quot; &quot;

display the file size of the image to see if the file size is shown under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
to display the size of the images below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery , please indicate whether the size of the images is displayed in the gallery .
in the Fol@@ der dialog , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the file selection store in HTML file , specify where the HTML page should be saved .
with the check box sub@@ folder you can set up with a sli@@ der or a rotating field to which level the sub@@ folders are included .
copy original images with the check box to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery .
to use the check box comment file , you can specify a comment file for cap@@ tion of images in the gallery .
in the check box sel@@ e color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original images .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image plug@@ ins interface ( manual ) modules .
although digi@@ ti@@ zed ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with significantly more metadata , such as eg ; via the camera or lens that can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end user . therefore , you should report problems and opportunities for improvement .
if you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes report .... This opens a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to encourage you to respond to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . however , you may have questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . in this mailing list , however , you should be able to speak English .
you can also visit the digi@@ code ; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; to participate , registration is in the developer mailing list . instructions to login to the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; edit ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ c is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ plug ; will you use additionally as Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; looks every sub@@ folder as album . no picture will be changed .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; dur@@ scanning recur@@ sively the library path in its entire depth . you cannot exclude any sub@@ folders unless it is in hidden folder . you can do this by inser@@ ting a dot in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have any photos as symbols . you can change this by taking any photo from the album and placing it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Cue List to manage your photos in the albums .
raw data backup : if you use the raw mode of your camera , you can handle it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course each medium and any card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ plug ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera is often used as a disk device . the connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives .
digital cameras , which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras , also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos generally are large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am can be read reliably . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may need to see thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to be digi@@ ti@@ zed is how easy it is to extend its functionality by adding modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ v@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier , and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to complete a function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop images everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ edi@@ n , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or to another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , data list , or search .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , the filter on the filen@@ ame only works if it is displayed in the toolbar . which fields are displayed can be configured in the Al@@ ben@@ Options dialog .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos that were edited by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the al@@ b properties or after the date on which the album was first created . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also select album Import images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it down . in the pop @-@ up menu you will need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album Coll@@ ections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can group together under a common name . the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos after collection from the toolbar or view albums by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the album date : used if you sort your albums by date with View albums by date sort .
buttons El@@ der , A@@ verage , New Year : these set the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or that of the average of the album . this will first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead the date of last change of each file is used in this folder .
if you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ pop ; open , the first picture will be selected in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ jn ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As album preview , select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports entering keywords for individual photos in the section My keyword list at the bottom of the main window . album Coll@@ ections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . of course , you can use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar .
if you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a short while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . you can avoid this by using Extras View all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information about each image is displayed below the corresponding preview . what information is available , you can change settings digi@@ ti@@ zed ; set up the albums page and adjust the preview images to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear when you leave the mouse poin@@ ter a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all key features of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the section Intro@@ duction to the main window displays such an auxiliary window .
photos are all that is edited by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it fits you . image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can view all the features that are edited with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by either selecting F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... . in the digi@@ code section , you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos .
you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . the applications listed there are controlled by the &amp; k@@ de ; file assignments for the file type . to do so , and how to customize them to your needs , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing by other image editing programs , there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store these data when you save the modified image . as a result , this information is lost from EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides two options for rotation . the simplest is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select rotate . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . remember that you retain the extension ( .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; delete , it will be moved into the garbage bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you &apos;d rather want to delete , you can use this by using Shift + Del .
&amp; quot ; My data sli@@ der ; organizes your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file .
when you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet down in the date view so that you can only show the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
if a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
key words can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . by doing so , you can lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also fold up parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ ste@@ em ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the key words are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so you can also use your keywords in other programs . in addition , the keywords are re @-@ imported as soon as digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the images are noticed .
you can add new keywords by using the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My keyword , or click on an existing keyword and then select a new keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this will be the keyword of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and drop it down . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting Cue Edit in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword category ; change .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select as Album preview in the context menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to make full use of the functionality with keywords , you first have to add keywords . this can be done in two ways : as soon as you select the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword . alternatively , you can also click the preview of the images with the right mouse button and select Cue Points from the context menu .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way you can assign a keyword for each person in a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc .
as soon as you have a photo with keywords , it will be shown below the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Remove from the Tags menu . the menu only shows the keywords associated with the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a tim@@ elessly adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . to select a tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ame you only need to click on the bottom rectangle of the box that indicates the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it will then appear in the list below .
includes all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more in the future .
next to the search box is a small lamp that will be green when the search hits hits . if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all images will be displayed again . if you haven &apos;t found the search , then the lamp will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the header OK and the search is done . the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection once again , you just have to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select to edit Search , the form for entering the search will appear again with the search information you entered . if you select as advanced search , the dialog for the extended search will appear to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for searching .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete from the Search context menu .
the Advanced search will provide you with an extended search form with many search options that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ p@@ ate ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules are added to this list with search group / search group added or deleted from it . each option can be associated with others about logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... Create .
and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; character@@ izes each picture by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two pic@@ torial signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar . by using a sw@@ ell@@ er@@ ist , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere along the symbol of in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and digi@@ ti@@ ze ; find the matching images . here too , a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it on and move it . move it while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally assumes your images contain ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ directory .
digi@@ plug ; provides an illuminated table in a separate window that lets you easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L Add the lamp table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lamp table and its window open . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ code ; main window , you can quickly open the lamp with L Tools illuminated table .
from the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you want to synchron@@ ize from the toolbar , select Zoo or move operations on one of the images , then you can compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series . if you navigate pair mode from the toolbar , then the two first images will automatically be loaded into the areas for the same . now , use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to see it in the right pane . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar pictures .
of course , ordinary delete actions work directly from the light table like F@@ 4 File Edit ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available in the illuminated table for both thumb@@ nails . this makes it possible for example to easily link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in pan function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to wave the visible area of the image , you need to click on it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the preview mode then both pictures will display the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . just use the zoom sli@@ der below the pictures or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode .
digital inventory management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up , find , protect and use your images . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ plug ; use . we look at the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group , backup , evaluate , sample , archive , optimize , maintain and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management records , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , seeks , transforms , assem@@ bles and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value .
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is according to your definition data that provide information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will need no inventory management to find a certain photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; . the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving to which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow have access to your photos , whether you want to store them on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; Note that some@@ time you need to switch to a larger drive .
you may be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements , such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % of the archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files makes a backup strategy and migration easier . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative picture .
we also recommend the option to save metadata in the settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? edited and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts , as you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . you start best with the evaluation or rank . this makes sense , because you can focus on the best photos in the further work .
now let &apos;s start with keywords , keywords , as you frequently use in other programs , or proceed categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import cat@@ alog@@ u@@ ized images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images in the right place . the re @-@ sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can simply be done by drag@@ ging a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam , while it tracks the sub@@ trees .
this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . filen@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
most people don &apos;t want to see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive .
take a look at this panorama . from afar , there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it more closely , then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Norman@@ die 60 years after landing . w@@ ow ! you start dre@@ aming to have associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others viewing your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him over the motif that you have moved to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling . you can even export it for a selection of images . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now already with speed of light .
the possibilities of explo@@ iting ge@@ ol@@ ocation are countless and will become even more profound in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your trips using pictures with geographical data .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use the copyright to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , thus also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information should be stored in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ code ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization may not be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author &apos;s title ( syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the job title of the photographer . examples of this can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this must be completed as well .
if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others . if the image is a stock photo , then here the group / agency that offers the picture is given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete or modify this , in the image embedded metadata . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; in the near future , such a module will be available for batch processing .
topics : disk failures , board failure , current sur@@ ges , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion
of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can also happen with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it concerns problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the largest data recovery firm in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these cau@@ tious issues have to be handled and you can &apos;t trust you for more than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for yourself .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable . so it &apos;s about choosing the right one .
CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to mistakes , even if you have just been written . therefore , they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CD and DVD , there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently causes wonders in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
slowly burn with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . after that , read the data again to check you . also , if you want to copy the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store it on a clean , dark dry and protected spot on animals . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that these media can read .
your manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives for this topic : Disk@@ etch study
shortly : disks hold the longest if you operate in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . with lower temperatures , the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot determine this error . this is in particular read errors and publishing counter@@ s . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the total loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have backed the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems .
while most electric devices do not make a lot of electric sho@@ cks , the devices with computer chips and high speed processors are different . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware age , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against current peaks is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs some of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug connector . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that all periph@@ er@@ als connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage protection devices that also have a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . this makes you ideal for on the go .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system against small fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in case of a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in an un@@ interrupted power supply .
this gives you the possibility to store your data and shut down the system . if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare your safety with current disturbances with the costs to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . finally , you should remember to keep all cables before you go on vacation .
the Amazon web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
you are , compared to the hard drives at home , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data over the comparatively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your pictures in full resolution online .
from the point of view of data backup the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a distributed storage . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ proof .
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the calcul@@ ator . all trans@@ missions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing about it is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all of these interrup@@ tions remain und@@ et@@ ected until you one day can open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not affected by transmission problems at the moment , you should look into the future . you will see thousands of errors per year already in 2010 .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with record errors on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms the Z@@ FS uses and is also available for Linux ; it is still not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . for not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it causes less damage than th@@ ef@@ ts or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ F@@ s and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings of fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while technology is further developed there is a natural boundary for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel cameras . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result more deterior@@ ated . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit with 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so you don &apos;t make anyone else responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by data loss every year . thus , you can backup your data according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything hazardous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the size change of hard disks .
suppose you make daily your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane landing tricks : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the complete house .
therefore Des@@ ast@@ er@@ Pre@@ vention means always a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as said above , a common reason for data loss despite backup is the panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made . this backup comes from a version@@ ing system closest to the exception that it is only scanned and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media .
this procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you will get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after you have made a complete check .
themes : metadata , stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , retain original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet .
to ensure that valuable images survive the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you must consider all that is being said today with caution and re @-@ assess while time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to be able to act as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should already be answered on the basis of explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards which are supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , then store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing the size of the system .
let &apos;s assume that you have the scal@@ ability with you and want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . at * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk has been detected by the system , but do not hang it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in MB@@ K ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # change the size of file if needed
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is available , you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . so you shouldn &apos;t use it anymore .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard GIF should replace . however , it can store much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . PNG can be relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression . this format we would like to recommend you to save your images .
TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ ault ) . it manages images in high quality but requires very large files . with some cameras you can store your images in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open format format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed on the basis of the need to uni@@ fy the camera formats . it is now available on the TIFF / EP format and committed to use of metadata .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer an original of your recording , mostly in raw format , to archive . X@@ MP fits to it because it stores metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems with the link between the metadata file and the image file and as mentioned above , the raw format is dated . therefore , you should consider if you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the c@@ amer@@ aman , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for fine editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were possibly cut off by the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only then in web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; in the section adding a photo to an album you will be able to add a description on how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your al@@ b database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , connect these to your computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when connecting the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all the photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the application are displayed on the camera for each file , photos , movies , music , etc .
before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Metad@@ ata metadata shows the internal metadata , such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc . this information is the same as in the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam , or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all . this loads all photos from their camera into one single album in &amp; digi@@ plug ; . downloading will not delete the photos and we recommend you to check if the pictures were securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all the photos , you can select only the desired with the standard selection methods from &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download the Sel@@ ected button . the Sel@@ ected button can be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images have not yet been edited by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you download the buttons all download or download selected albums , a dialog appears with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of the existing albums is displayed in the My Albums section . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; load the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All button . if you want to delete only some , you have to select them first and then delete the selected ones .
please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . so , you should carefully check if the photos were successfully edited in a digi@@ plug ; album , before you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera system completely , you should do this via the camera system , as this is much faster .
cameras often do not use descri@@ p@@ tive names for the photos . the file names are usually re @-@ used after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can lead to double filen@@ ames if you upload photos of different recording mini@@ stries to the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was made in the filen@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically every day .
the first two are related to the data about the author in the default auto @-@ identity section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can e.g. use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % H : % M : % S in the editing field . switch to the option Date &amp; Time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option camera filen@@ ame , you have the option to change the filen@@ ames in lower case when downloading . or in upper@@ case if you prefer .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ plug ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the section page bar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced and select the Automatic Rotation in the lower area of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made , it can be edited and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; these sub @-@ albums are automatically uploaded to the image data . all images with the same date will be loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a data section , you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced button and select the option Dat@@ eline @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is to download . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , and digi@@ ti@@ sed , you know where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear . select the folder and press OK to start the upload .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a generic term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and can be displayed on a map . identification of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it may be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ code ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ings and map references . the question is actually more how the data will come into these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , by re@@ working the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical mapping ( manual ) and last about manual input of known places .
as far as we know there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few that work together with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save these data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the module for geographic mapping .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the l@@ atitude and l@@ atitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phi@@ l Harv@@ ey . it uses the sign @-@ like coordinates created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left .
select action on embedded preview or start image editing . you can set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ p@@ ate ; note when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . also for database synchron@@ isation , this data is written into the IP@@ TC fields .
author title is a by@@ word for author &apos;s line : this field should contain the photographer &apos;s job title . this can be names such as photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the author &apos;s field , it must also be filled .
editor is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency , such as Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be registered here as this is the picture other &amp; quot ; provider quot ; . if the image is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the relevant IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this will allow the metadata to be permanently included in the image and not just in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam . these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ kam , without going to be lost .
save images as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse cursor is in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; preview , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . each file in one &amp; digi@@ box ; album folder that has none of these extensions will be ignored by &amp; digi@@ kam .
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
the settings of the lighting table by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , each time you open the lighting table , these settings are switched on if possible . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; if you have one then you can get better picture results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can turn off the toolbar if you are using image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light colour in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing , this View Mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color transform@@ ations . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation .
with the PNG compression setting , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality as PNG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
with the option TIFF Com@@ pression you can un@@ zip the default compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it does not affect the image quality , since the default algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the loss @-@ prone position , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze , image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
the standard assumption is that all green pixels are equal . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react to more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines , this difference creates a lat@@ tice pattern in output . this option draws the picture a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ NG@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the auto color balance is used .
this setting is only used if white balance is not set . standard is a fixed colour balance based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed pictures in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the standard is the top @-@ lights , so the parts of your images are burned down because of the inability of your camera to capture the peak lights , as transparent white to view . the setting colors will create some unusual results as it shows the top lights in various rose shades . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the s@@ add@@ lers .
this is possible because blue pixels generally do not satur@@ ate as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam , and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much color or white you want .
when you select the re@@ construct option , you will have the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each picture .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data that comes from the color filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
and D@@ cra@@ w provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests , it looks like A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ous Direc@@ ted ) created the quality for me and the paper used by me . V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ rap@@ w .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for color gra@@ ding correction as you are done during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how these should be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; information such as to translate color information from one color space to the other is thus the colors as accurate as possible .
behavior Questions when an image is opened in image editing / Color management module with raw files start .
color Profile folder Sets here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles .
settings of ICC profiles You have here the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be deposited . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your images are color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera creator and model you are using . not all profiles are built in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma isn &apos;t correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the color mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of Profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print a picture , because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could be corrected manually instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is pretty obvious which colour profile is intended for . unfortunately , not in the models of Canon . therefore here a table of cameras and profiles will follow these together . this answer is of course not official :
the Canon profile extension makes it possible to see the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ plug ; many modules support that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these are then edited by &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules will appear as new entries in the main window and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Brief commands .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the ad .
the camera features show a list of all cameras supported at the time on the left . on the right hand side there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection that tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you select a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera box . you will need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / min , where you can mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on .
if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the main window from the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can display the conversation of &amp; digi@@ p@@ ate ; by del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly edited by &amp; digi@@ kam , if you use the option Apply changes in the right side@@ bar without queries . otherwise , you need to save the changes using the button changes .
you can also sign &amp; digi@@ plug the display of the welcome screen ; when starting , this speeds up and digi@@ ti@@ zed the boot process .
the setup Bei@@ m start searching for new photos pus@@ hes &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; searching for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ code ; . if something has been deleted from the base folder , you will ask &amp; digi@@ p@@ ate ; you see if it is to delete it from the database .
various color schemes can be edited in &amp; digi@@ p@@ ate ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the toolbar Pre@@ ferences . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , please refer to this tutorial for more information .
you can use them to view and edit your photos and for correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of preview and selecting the item Show / Edit .
the image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ code ; so you may not be part of your distribution . you can find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the image processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , enlargement factor , and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge , including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image processing will change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used the Save or Save button from the toolbar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
you might need to make a copy of your image before changing it . you can save it by saving file .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by re@@ producing from the File menu or using the Rest@@ ore button Rec@@ over in the toolbar . you then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last saving .
virtually any image editing action can be und@@ one or restored . the last action you can und@@ o by editing or restoring , by selecting Edit restoring from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should make use of the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to und@@ o and mem@@ ori@@ ze C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB , for a moment on the toolbar or Rest@@ ore button in the toolbar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , picture high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo in and out in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view where you use the Es@@ c key . normally , the toolbar can also be displayed . if you do not want this , you can change it in the Settings dialog from &amp; digi@@ kam .
if you want to print the current image , you can print in the File Image menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or complete sets . entire image preview pages can be printed from your selection . you just have to select the images with the standard methods and select from the Menu album Export Print Ass@@ ist . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice .
the digi@@ plug ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right , providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation arrows , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five tabs is cli@@ cked :
multiple Click on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear again .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented on it , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then stored .
in addition to the Apply button , there is a button . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field of ur@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the key words used previously in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the keyword search . you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the lower end is another relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , they are saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all key words of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC @-@ field keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only apply to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to add a selection with a keyword , please refer to the Key@@ word filter section .
the Key@@ word filter side@@ bar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - Date , keyword and search views . if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and drop keywords . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword exists already , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar tag . the keyword filter is on no keywords , which reduced the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created it , and notice that it should be one or two , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , key word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an Advanced search through all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group@@ ing button . the options will then look as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors coming from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photograph@@ ed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that correspond to the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
if the topic comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons to push for the results they want . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . additionally , you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so you get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all of the six criteria listed below , you do not have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB color space . ( see below for more information )
your only other images are by email or the web where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB functions so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and have to worry about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we really see will be presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to vibr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you &apos;re working in s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to vibr@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB is based on s@@ RGB . if you work as in the color space of s@@ RGB , then you either have to stick your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you attempt further manual editing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , Same , Automatic Balance and Con@@ tr@@ ast Exp@@ and from the Cor@@ rec@@ en Automatic correction menu try automatically to make the most of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the brightness values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced .
balance : this method adju@@ sts the intensity factor of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . this results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that either causes wonders in a picture or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic compens@@ ating : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and light limit tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range and a re@@ v of all the values in between . this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the White Balance of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; is a semi@@ automatic tool to carry out the whit@@ eness of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited since you have a color space with 8 bits per color . so if you can be too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will fail better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu item colors White Balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target picture . the preview will be dynamically adjusted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance , then click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photo has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right up , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamic changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shade can be adjusted or di@@ mm@@ ed down the shadow details of your photos .
to play an@@ stat with the above checks , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white balance . this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the exposure indicator increases the colors , if more than a color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result displayed in white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Load buttons do exactly this . every setting of the white balance you have set allows you to save it to a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button returns all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will result in another picture than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image here . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high quality images . however , this encoding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for brightness . a detailed guide for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted from the chapter Color Management .
another important tool is available in the menu under colours tone correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and also allows you to save your settings so that you always need the same correction . in the manual for sound correction you will find further information .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure issues is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; tool colour effects provide you with four colour effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created when exposed a partial pressure to a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . the colored , dark@@ er areas protected the sensitive photographic paper from the additional light . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the solar process . at approximately 50 % intensity the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try it em@@ bel@@ lish lots of photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition by &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual for you to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of the photo . you can watch the various color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors .
if you can make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the opposite problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the brightness / satur@@ ation tool is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is located to improve exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you need only the range of the sli@@ ders for the purpose described here . specify the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , hist@@ ogram , active channel or selected area . beneath the graph are three sli@@ ders that can be cli@@ cked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the controls and make sure that the image changes .
on the right side , you can view the original and preview the image . the preview will be updated dynamically according to the image &apos;s settings . the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear depic@@ tion is often the most useful . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three kno@@ bs : the top for the dark notes , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for medium tones , often called g@@ amma @-@ values .
the three color pin@@ pi@@ ons can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , middle and light tones . furthermore , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . for example , compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden picture as background while something else is to be seen in the background .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later . to do so , the Gim@@ p Levels Format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the option Over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below is an example of the adjustment of the input values to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right :
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is changed by the module :
next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most meaningful . for images with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode further helps .
for example , if you move a short panel to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond to dark@@ er output tones and dark@@ er the associated image pixel .
preview the original photo is to see a red marker . if you want to shift this marker to the area you want to change , a matching curve is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option Over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if available in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were placed with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ code ; image editing is a tool to enhance the color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first notice how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram shows you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness , even if you have the option Mon@@ och@@ rome as the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating magnificent black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the color . if that is the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion by reducing the color space first .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer setting can save you for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option Over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance Store is enabled . the original image is shown under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction capability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step because color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scen@@ eries and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at day@@ time . so similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and enhances the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epitheli@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold in the leaf tones . this is very similar to the process of le@@ aching a pressure and the re @-@ development in a serum . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epitheli@@ um il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ code ; Apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) to be seen . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ code ; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the image into a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter set the desired frame type for your picture . throughout , the image is surrounded by a coloured line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce embra@@ ces it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame per cent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture in any place . this is also possible at several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . the larger the image , the bigger the character set must be . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click the &quot; OK &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed any more .
with the &amp; digi@@ code ; tool template you can put a template over a picture .
the menu Image Tem@@ plate Apply in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template , there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you must take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of the template , simply send an email in English to the digi@@ code ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ code @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the button root folder in the dialog . select the folder where you have copied the template files . these settings are scheduled for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder appears automatically . the selection of a folder automatically updates the thumb@@ nail of the templates .
below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button increases the picture below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image then automatically adju@@ sts the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ code ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but generates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture look shar@@ per . in fact , it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psych@@ edel@@ ic . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ or and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting .
images without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images require correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digital@@ isation process is composed of only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn results in blur@@ red edges a bit blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually need more than normal cameras for private users .
images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers turn a field of focus while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with sharpen@@ ing tool . you can use the menu entry correc@@ ting sharpen@@ ing .
the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the noise . generally , the most useful technique is focuss@@ ing to shar@@ pen an image . you can achieve more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ shar@@ pen mask is a very good tool for removing v@@ eils from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount will enhance the effect . if you make the blur@@ red mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates near sharp edges create .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . therefore , you should shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red picture added to the original . thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . this allows you to define a minimal difference in order to apply for an edge of the filter . in this way areas with a soft switch between the sounds are excluded from the shar@@ pen and therefore beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red color filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mas@@ king was used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the edited and digi@@ ti@@ zed tool re@@ focus an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted filtering @-@ filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is a better approach than trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Viennese Fil@@ tr@@ ation . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ red mask . re@@ focus achieves mostly better results than blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing color re@@ focus in image editing .
the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Vienna In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s fold is influenced by the distant pixel . this causes un@@ desired results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most of the images , the default value should yield 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your picture is very blur@@ red and then pay attention to hal@@ low .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ness effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad .
g@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your blur@@ red gau@@ ze is &apos; sch . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the palate . note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all trimm@@ ing , color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not visible immediately , but leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts later .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ har@@ sh@@ ly mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used as sharpen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically , un@@ sharp mask must always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practically the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often better in the processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
the original blur@@ red color image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information on the methods of sharpen@@ ing in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the sli@@ der smooth@@ s the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the colour ink provides a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust this here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration process . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to an even smo@@ othing over the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should maintain details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is needed subsequently . please note that the attention should always be subordin@@ ated to the direction dependen@@ cy .
directional dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value close to 1 only smooth@@ es in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ul@@ arity or CCD noise , a high value will produce shaft @-@ like patterns . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . therefore set this value matching the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : specify how often the algorithm will go through . normally , here 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle step width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is selected , it should also be selected small . make sure that small angles generate a long term . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never larger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only minimal . it dou@@ bles the runtime . we therefore recommend it to om@@ it it .
the buttons Save as and load make exactly this . any adjustment of image errors can be corrected with this in a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is relatively fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and take a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button .
below you can see how to remove image errors with small arti@@ facts . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by a poor film storage during the trip . the original picture is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides a selectable picture filter to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about digital cameras sensor noise , you can read these in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced Settings can remain with the default settings .
the radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller faults .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to determine lumin@@ ous changes . if it is increased , noise peaks are deleted . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubrication occurs again .
edges : controls edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can &apos;t be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas , which are typically thicker , but also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius respon@@ ds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is raised , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high can occur .
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tool to sof@@ ten with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment with the smo@@ othing . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ ti@@ zed ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photographic art@@ ef@@ acts .
this rest@@ au@@ ration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ul@@ arity , scratches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local faults that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized pictures . the smo@@ othing takes place along the image contours and thus receives the content as it also makes the human eye .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
reduce JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , he creates some compres@@ sions &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons Save as and load make exactly this . any adjustment of photo restoration can here@@ with be saved in a text file and later re@@ charged .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and take a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button termin@@ ating .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious movie gran@@ ulation on the faces .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were used to see an old color photo created with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts which were caused by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove hot@@ pixels of photos that were created with a CCD camera gem , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the button dark . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark picture directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the right dark picture to the picture to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will remember the last dark picture and will automatically load it again in the next session .
the image area and preview help you to correct the result inside the picture . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
Dur@@ ham : an average of the neighbor pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture can be seen under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo formats , can &apos;t illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area evenly . instead , they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . telep@@ hot@@ o lenses may also show this behavior .
but it also has disadvantages . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed so that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also use an aperture of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise blur@@ red effects arise through movement .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and color or gray scale models of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter using an equivalent transformation on a rough image that was made without this filter . the tool net@@ ting correction addresses the transformation with a Center@@ filter on an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three more controls of the target picture .
density : this parameter controls the degree of loss of light at the point of the biggest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which allows an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the lumin@@ ous intensity of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target picture with these options . the controls only provide you with positive values , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fine read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the exposure of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma look at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ code ; image editing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to a picture . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a color thickness and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David H@@ od@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree handles the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third grade has a similar rounded effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth grade correc@@ ts the remote corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of distortion second grades . with negative values , t@@ onal distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion of the fourth grade . this value has a stronger effect on the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters &apos; has the opposite sign of the parameter in General .
zoom : this value re @-@ scales the image size and thus leads to a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
brigh@@ tening : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values at the next start .
the tone or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best perform this correction as the first . if you cut a picture new and then perform a ton @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent to the fold .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal aid line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to fix the dotted lines . move it to an important location , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the key / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a kis@@ sing distortion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can remove them using the cro@@ pping tool in the menu Transform@@ ers cro@@ pping out of the image processing or via the zoom sli@@ der of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs such as front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the t@@ onal correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating the infrared film of the G@@ implic@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview , you can set two parameters of film gran@@ ul@@ arity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the Add Film Lic@@ ens@@ ing option if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO control changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
as the filter mixes color channels for the reproduction of infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is shown under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the nick@@ names .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter Film Auth@@ ori@@ zation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ul@@ arity on your images . this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . in order to increase the sensitivity of the films , the makers mix large silver bas@@ kets of photo emul@@ sion .
the film particle effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless ambi@@ ance from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular sight specially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you must use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although frequently higher values are required , set to ISO 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film sample effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature images and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large pictures .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel large picture is 1 and smo@@ othing 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage . images whose gra@@ dients vary slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch .
there are two controllers with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; Filter Gra@@ ve shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter Gra@@ ve is a fast tool to give your images back with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing on the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , landscape @-@ like landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filter . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is seen by blocks of glass .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave @-@ blocks 1 the picture is distorted with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the button termin@@ ating .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from one centre . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radial blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by rotating the pixels around one center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
ran@@ ge@@ finder : wi@@ pes the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a linear moving , z : B : photograph@@ ing from a car or train , camera .
sof@@ tening blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focal effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sh@@ out blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the picture by accidental displacement of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : finds the p@@ add@@ ling pool in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ate it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button termin@@ ating .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives the natural your images a wet look . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . as the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image , it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops .
you can hold with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; image editing a range free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning . the tools for this can be found in the menu Transformation turning or transforming mirrors .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how to infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you recover the missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes here a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select Add Transform@@ ers Size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog can be viewed below .
the tool for res@@ izing uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with better quality then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ated was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any photo magni@@ fication can be saved as text file and loaded later .
infl@@ ating photo is very fast with what it does , but it can last very long and move a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button termin@@ ating .
you can see below an example of photo bubbles by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only an often under@@ estimated operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to assemble a picture . to crop a photo you simply need to create a rectangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rectangle . you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse .
if you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off . this will give you a good overview of how your photo after cutting would look like . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drag@@ ging at the corners of the rectangle .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the C@@ trl + + X button in the toolbar and the photo is cut to size ( C@@ trl + + X ) . use the file Save or Save file from the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo .
in the preview pane , you can change the size of the rectangle by drag@@ ging the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact .
in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as portrait format or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and the landscape width is always assigned .
the tool After aspect ratio cut uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ res , inches or any other physical size . you can , for example , see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
below in the dialog box , you can set the range for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
depending on the orientation of the tool , the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the co@@ hab@@ itation help enable you to hide help so that you can put your images together better . these help are :
harmonic triangle : harmonic parti@@ es are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in similarly harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden Middle : the golden center is a division that affects various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we perceive as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 18@@ 0@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who built their temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects used the golden pitch at all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center .
the golden center provides more fluid relief lines when you put together a picture . these help are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third gel , the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a sym@@ metric visual flow on this type .
another rule is the rectang@@ les of the golden spiral , also called golden rectang@@ les . these rectang@@ les are used to draw the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye is cent@@ red at the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles also derive from the above discussed golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rectang@@ les . note that unlike harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not a tri@@ angular tri@@ angles .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach .
the horizontal mirror and vertical mirr@@ oring options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
with the button Color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle .
when you make a photo , it happens easily that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing and tool @-@ free rotation . select to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the sli@@ der to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to fix this is to use the function Transform@@ ers cro@@ pping out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the automatic cutting function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option leaves the picture a bit after rotation . note however the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
corner left : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right up : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
corner left : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective the picture is slightly s@@ me@@ ared . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective you get unwanted tri@@ angular holes at the corners . a way to clean it is to cut the picture with Transform@@ ers cro@@ pping out of the image processing .
the sh@@ ear@@ ing tool is used to shift a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal sc@@ aling e.g. will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left . this is no rotation , the image is distorted .
sh@@ ear@@ ing your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be set to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the she@@ ar , the picture becomes blur@@ red . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two shots generating twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture has un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transforming crop out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ code ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the formats available depend on your system and , in some cases , of the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all the file formats available on your system at this point . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF underneath .
digi@@ plug only shows files in formats that you know . this is done by file extension and a comparison of it with a predefined list . if the extension is listed in the list , the edited file will be edited and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ plug ; accept . in the configuration section you will find more information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
image compression is the use of data compression algorithms for digital images . in this way redundant information is reduced in order to store image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss@@ less when specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw picture format , read on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . in the configuration section you will find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ kam . .
more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam .
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; understands these formats and therefore has no built @-@ in options to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam , the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies use to start the program for playback .

many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ code ; included . your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ t@@ ing- , noise reduction , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp mask , &amp; etc ; . use a unified dialogue type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture Application quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertically divide without dup@@ licate . the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal divide without dup@@ licate . the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview range .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal divide . the upper section shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ M@@ ouse over &apos; style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag and drop this frame with the mouse within the image and click on the part of the image you want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the ability to reset all buttons to your default values .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it on and move it . move it while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally assumes your images contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pallets that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter case , they are located in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the Palette dialog , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders by files .
the cursor is displayed in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described below the Pal@@ let View . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used for selection . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box is inserted under the Color button under the button Color , the color is inserted from the color table at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the over@@ writing mode has been selected . this mode allows you to select by selecting the tick box below the cursor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used along with the actions copying , cutting and past@@ ing .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end character , if another color follows . if there are three numerical values in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit .
the colors in the palette and the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left side .
graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . the programs , the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; contains , are ob@@ sol@@ ete &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ tion@@ Viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; - graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ tion@@ Viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; dic@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so a change in the graph in &amp; dic@@ ate ; re@@ counting the graph and representing in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ poin@@ viewer ; in a &amp; k@@ ata ; component to open
load large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 nodes and a h@@ ack to show more than these nodes )
further required software : &amp; k@@ tion@@ Viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; required for representation of graph@@ s .
the main window displays the open graph@@ s , each in a separate sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list Last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog File .
after selecting one or more dot ; files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the character area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph will be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change .
if you open a graph@@ ene file outside of a running &amp; k@@ poin@@ viewer ; instance open , eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
when you start the program , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as change it later .
you can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely selected .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be adjusted to this page . thereby , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph divided on several pages without header and with another font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut loading page gives you the option to set the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard drive , eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or ask the program each time .
the Open page gives you the option to set the behavior of a graph viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is requested .
the session management page gives you the possibility to set the start behavior of a viewer . you can set a default behavior ( open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked for each start afterwards .
the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up further options :
here you can select among various &amp; graphic ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
dot ; algorithm , the standard for directional graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered represent@@ ations of directed graph@@ s . the algorithm puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ executed graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ board model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multiple @-@ lat@@ ted trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .
the Cir@@ co ; algorithm places the nodes in a circle according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as a parameter , and display the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can specify &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms , or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph@@ ene ( directional or un@@ eri@@ zed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type to ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the What is the mouse poin@@ ter . click on a &amp; GUI with this mouse poin@@ ter to get more help to this element ( if any ) .

a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; in the Settings menu you will find further options .
the main window of the icon editor is divided into five areas : the main toolbar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ Color chart and the grid in which you draw the symbol .
creates a new symbol . if the current file has been changed , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . then a dialog appears where you can choose whether the icon is to be created from a template , or whether you want to start from scratch .
und@@ o the last step @-@ made step . if you do not have a step back , this function is disabled .
insert the clip@@ board content as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in shades of gray . this can create colors that do not match those of the symbol palette .
does not change the symbol , but sets the current drawing color to the color of the point on which you click .
the status bar displays the current actions . from left to right , it displays the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
insert the clip@@ board content as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up ... a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background and toolbar .

the K@@ IP@@ I module provides you with tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scanning images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu entry , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by using the default values of duc@@ ts to select your image . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the button . the estimated file size will be shown in the right lower corner .
make sure that the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the Scan button you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the destination picture appears . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not compressed and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image to save the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected in the Import &gt; Screen Photo menu . a window appears where you can set the different screen@@ shots :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station . if you have picked up the complete Desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen@@ shot is to wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog Options dialog appears with the options described above .
the K@@ IP@@ I Modul Calendar currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I Team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note that the participants of this list speak English .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r makes it possible to send photos to the people that are important to you . you can show your favorite photos of the world that make photos of your camera mobile online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the module Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload pictures from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time you will be guided through the process of generating a token . this will be used for your authentication . it is thus virtually your identification to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after the successful registration the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . you will find the following page after a successful registration .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module starts ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current permissions the module displays . to upload you need write permissions . the module currently does not support any other permissions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions .
the Add Photos button should be pressed once you have all the other options set . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you click on the O@@ k button , the upload of the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server starts .
the Tags field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during upload .
with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options , you can set the permissions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you choose the option change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery export is a tool for ex@@ porting your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery @-@ Export currently has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I Team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note that the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF data of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ relations . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog will then appear . to load a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were recorded at the same time in the same places as the pictures of your camera .
when loading the file an automatic correlation is performed that indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera zone must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera zone here .
the setting for the maximum time deviation indicates an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera distance . if the deviation is lower , the data will be merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have track data from a location for images , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the inter@@ pol@@ ation and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the right data . if you know that in reality a location is in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . as the dialog displays the coordinates of one call to the next you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . to do so , select the region and magni@@ fy it . choose this again and again until you reach a sufficient accuracy . the altitude must always be manually selected . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ tool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Image Gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a gallery of HTML pages con@@ forming to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab allows you to select all the albums you want to export to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page will be displayed .
the tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each image a page creates a gallery in which each image will also get a separate page . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; D@@ exter@@ show , displayed
the Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG image format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images .
with Other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , this also affects file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nails will allow you to customize some of the settings from the Album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during production . the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I Image Viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I Image Viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and folders . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start a screen will be displayed in full screen mode . this can be changed to a win@@ dow@@ ed mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less Module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below without the usual losses of quality and metadata .
the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is that it increases the file size because no compression of the color information takes place . for example , this can be found in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I Team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note that the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the box @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image .
this function does not work for all image formats . you can copy it from anywhere , but not write in any target format . JPEG is supported in writing . please check id@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG encoder module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG encoder can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual images you can add a basic image transfer . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first , you need to select the images which are to be packed into the MPEG slide show . afterwards , you can create the module using Extras MPEG slide show .
the images you have selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting of the pictures or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV Standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let them black . you can set the name and path of the file created by name of the MPEG output file . keep as the extension mp@@ g as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you adjust all settings to your wishes , you can start the production of the movie using the encoding knob . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now go to a coffee quickly or in peace and enjoy the slideshow when you are back .
if an indication appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button Settings right below .
the printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is , for example , useful to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a original quote from Him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera creator . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the raw file that is to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings are to be used for white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the filen@@ ame remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
tagged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all information on your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you are planning to edit your images frequently or later use them elsewhere , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as memory format , the metadata that is contained in the raw file is stored in the JPEG File in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion by using the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel .
the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . however , this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the star@@ ring and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images from an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or enlarge the image .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
propor@@ tionally ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen size .
non @-@ proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
pre@@ press : prepares the photo for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target picture , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the images window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images using the thumb@@ nail image dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right .
you can also drag and drop images to the picture list to add the list of images to be sent .
removing the images from the list of images to be sent will be removed .
after you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you just have to add the addresses and the subject here . the pictures you selected are already attached as attachments .
most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations to the size of sending e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and re @-@ used every time you change it .
select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and added to the mail .
PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the loss @-@ free formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original copies are added to the images you send .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages , looking for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end .
after starting the Advanced slideshow , a window with questions about how to display your slideshow will appear . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ transitions option in the presentation mode activ@@ ates very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the option file name indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the Loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a loop . afterwards , you can cancel it manually with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not the order of the images used in the album .
between the images the temporal distance between the images can be set . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly choose another effect between images .
during the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on you .
with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current filen@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I Team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note that the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set an image as a background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have completed your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can start with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; by these browse , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , there are now entries in each group , thus in persons , places and in the group keyword entries .
in the browser window you can see the categories you entered when you have entered your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images . in the following , each one is described .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person only the images are displayed on which both persons are to be seen . by this selection method you can restrict the number of displayed images from a few thousand images to a few individual images .
if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view the images in your field using thumb@@ nails .
in the image , each person has the same symbol before their name . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own preview image , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself .
to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right side of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display the view for each category separately ( if you do not have suitable images for your search words ) .
however , you must select which image for each individual person should be displayed . to do this , you need to select the image editor window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the respective person in the context menu . here you can select the image for the respective person . in the View window , you can customize the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and by selecting which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you view the search in the main window , a dialog will show you that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog again on the image .
if you enter a string into the lab@@ eling or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images will be searched after this text . if you would like , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , according to images , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the Homepage of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduction videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog select the demo if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then some sample images are loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try it .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the Homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can preview the displayed items preview from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview pane ) and in addition , the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in preview viewing .
you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline . if you select a area , you will preview only images of this time period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two options to create HTML pages with your images . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create through the menu File HTML ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each section is described more precisely .
first enter the title of the title and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created on the overview page .
finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed that is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , that all images are from a party . note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently all images are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from particular viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are un@@ ambig@@ uous , which is why they are not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . this allows those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download any pictures , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site may change the resolution at any time you have set . so it can search your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time . if you want to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you have to select the root folder where all of your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be started after the pages have been created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to it . so that the import function , see , works correctly , you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings described above have all three based on base folders respectively URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to create your images with these . however , if you have already spent quite a lot of time for viewing the image information , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc . then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not do again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others to your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external ones . they differ in whether the images are stored in the file itself or whether the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you have all the images together and that you can share this file independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export menu ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be scanned . this is of course only possible if you created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
the following describes the dialog for ex@@ porting images that you can access through the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is to be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available :
in the manual to copy Man@@ ually to the .@@ k@@ im file , you have to copy the images into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with option Automati@@ cally copy to copy the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are regular zip files . as most of the images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not recommended to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export File option .
the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each picture should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import menu ... select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; import the exported database as described in .
the wizard to import consists of four steps . first you have to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import images should be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is called in your database , so you will be asked in the third dialog box which categories of the file to be imported and what categories they correspond to in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the image .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at images , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will go through the different steps of ( 1 ) determining the information about your images , through ( 2 ) browsing and watching , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures , but it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but frequently this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; saves all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of its images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. normal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder where your images are stored and will automatically re@@ use it in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; if you want to start another folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
through the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can move to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual you will explain the different settings .
on the left you can see six different icons , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call by pressing a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option .
it describes how you can define different properties for each picture , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section , sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete members groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
in the list box above you can select the category you want to configure . in the left part of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; share its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
the modules can be called from the Module menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules are used by multiple applications together , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should first test new modules first with the demo database before you use them on your own pictures Application &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or through the Help menu . don &apos;t say I wouldn &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that the modules use over K@@ IP@@ I together are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album do not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications arrange their images in albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates for some modules the order by albums , so that you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
this simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the pictures that show you the preview right now .
besides the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you have defined in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category Person@@ s , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so , so if you have selected people to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select the modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
under the toolbar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . currently , it does not contain very much information , as you do not have any information about your images . in the section we will return to this window , now click on the entry to show you an overview of all the existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons who are shown on the image , where the image has been taken , etc . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments by using the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text box by specifying persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be moved , so that the names used are moved upwards , the persons can find and arrange them faster .
if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sort by date on the list .
if you have selected notes for each picture individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with comments . in this case simply click on the above and back buttons that are located under the preview of the picture on the top right .
if you have received multiple images , e.g. with the same person , it may be more convenient to mark all those pictures and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA .
in the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that it is a sub @-@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the comment dialog context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . additionally , you can simply drag an entry to a category and drop it to make it a sub@@ category of this entry . caution , this pres@@ upp@@ oses that you are sorting your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that creates the upper edge of the frame . you can also make a custom window from a frame by drag@@ ging it outside of the window area .
if you have adjusted the look of the window so to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... which gives you among other things the possibility to save the current setup and look of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to view this window later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide windows here . you can see this process in the picture .
if you select the images in the browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or all images if you do not have a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will appear in the image viewer . if you don &apos;t yet open a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely , use pictures without having you stored on the hard disk . of course you have to have the images stored somewhere , thus &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all necessary pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
images where the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard disk . however , the thumb@@ nails are present for the images 5 @-@ 9 , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can preview these images . however , you can &apos;t view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , this feature requires you to copy files from folders and copy them back . if so , please do not support them to insert the CD in question . if so , please buy a larger hard drive to save all images .
in the pictures menu you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures in such a way that at the end those remaining , which you want to make for others , and click on Current View in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also select all the images that your little sister may see and lock the menu entry All but up @-@ to @-@ date view .
this allows you to specify which images are to be hidden in case of the case . if you now give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry to open images , so that all the images you have locked is hidden . if you want to view the pictures again , click on the lock .
it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the privacy menu .
please note that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who have with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to forbi@@ d the view on private pictures .
the reason you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; about an image _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . of course , it shows the image , but additional all the information you have entered through the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was done , etc .
if you want to see the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and place somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is to be displayed at all . all of these options are available after a right click on the viewer . the then appearing context menu can be seen below .
some words in the info box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser will display matching entries to this . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the picture above and below . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions are also accessible from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you are using the viewer you can simply drag a rectangle with the mouse . with the minus key you can zoom in with the mouse . with the minus key you can zoom out the Plus button zo@@ omed in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the outcome of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ ation button sets the zoom , so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ oming operations that work in videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key are .
with the Script functions from the context menu you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current image using the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you view images it may happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture . at the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names . however , you may prefer to select only the image and look at more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to have pictures with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in this picture you will see a picture where the characters A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images , these are available in your browser . so if you want to view all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , just provide all of them once with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and especially features can be displayed in preview view . if you can view categories in the preview screen , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image has been selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will be allowed to paint on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . on the way you can und@@ o your painted later .
in order to close the painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; select on the image from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , you have to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an object already selected , as all sub@@ properties are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar , or select a menu item in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed to enable you to choose the right position :
with Del@@ ete either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove previously selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to Apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message with an error description will be displayed . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply and Cancel the Chan@@ ges .
when you enter the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
by default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross it locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a shelf level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the default window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also save multiple window orders and easily switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below a view , draw the beginning water to the top or bottom of a view . a rectangle will then display the new position .
to create a new column , drag the user to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , select the beginning agent in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the map tab at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the beginning water to the desktop or click on the small left pointing arrow in the beginning bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the beginning bar . to prevent closing , click the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views in the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any location .
you can save the current window view with view window order ... Save . there will be a dialog where you can save the window order from an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them render . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program has to be installed properly . as this manual is written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click on Ren@@ dering the Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar , or select the View Sc@@ ene menu item .
a render mode meets the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select R@@ ender modes in the View menu ... the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the box size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small part of the image , select the check box section and enter the image section to render into the input fields .
in combination field quality you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User Manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with just one ray per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , images with this property look better .
when you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling refers to the neighbouring pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because every pixel is split again and again because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixels exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are tra@@ cked individually and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch on J@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for rendering quality is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays don &apos;t hit any object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly terminated , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select Import Menu Add File ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command scope of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog box shows a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; ren@@ ders a scene . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on the help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height data ) in paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the scene folder , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rectangle for the viewing field in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object @-@ catch of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions .
if you tick the high level of detail for extended projections , all wire @-@ model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this property results in a better approach for projections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you tick wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
when you tick the bottom , a bottom is rendered underneath the objects . the floor is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
when you tick the edge smo@@ othing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used to render the scenes . you can adjust the depth and threshold values . you can find more detailed information about the parameters in the R@@ ender modes section .
on this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders . in the Window As@@ sets section you will learn how to create and save window orders .
the standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of window orders present shows all existing window orders . you can create a new arrangement using the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Remove .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the selected window order . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the button Remove .
with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with map card you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs . if you follow all the steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball at one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings , before you complain that you will receive only a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have installed everything correctly , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pres@@ et window order :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you will get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
to follow this guide you first have to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit menu item Edit . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire @-@ model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you can see the contents of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , you will find more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points that you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
when you press the Apply or Enter key , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the perspective of the camera here .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could , for example , insert a box ( inser@@ ting Infin@@ ite Body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply or the Enter key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ model view now also displays the plane , al@@ beit at the moment only as a limited end@@ point . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
when you view the object tree accurately , you will find that you can fold the entry for the bottom by clicking on the + in front of the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options and change the possible settings in the object properties pane .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows :
first select the bottom to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog opens , in which you can select how the object should be inserted . please select first sub@@ title . the pigment is then displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pig@@ mentation ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pigment only shows a matte black material , because you still have to enter settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the box and the ball in the preview , click the Apply button and then click the Pre@@ view button .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . here are some more settings necessary . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called one color . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select mon@@ och@@ rome each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already be able to execute this step , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the sphere is just as easy to create as the ground :
in view of object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the Apply button ) , so the ball has contact with the floor . otherwise the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the ground around one unit down .
of course the rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step , put a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the ground , give the ball a pigment as color :
select first object and change the name for example in ball Pig@@ ment . click on ball Pig@@ ment , then select colors and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press the Enter key .
the brightness effect and reflection result already result in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces even if metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er has ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a R@@ ender Method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer sho@@ ots hypo@@ the@@ tical beams from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that render the scenes ) by every pixel in the scene . the render will calculate the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect . thus the scene pixel is processed for pixel .
as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you will also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , any scene that is to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the recently restored command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Back@@ stage .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance , keyboard short@@ cuts , and default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can change or add new commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
opens a dialog for setting up the toolbar . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
a B@@ ump Map is a way to pre@@ tend rough surfaces without having to model each diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface without alter@@ ing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a B@@ ump Map and a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying a picture file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return key .
you can set whether any image should be displayed in your own window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the filen@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the operation of &amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; in the other two , short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be specified for the respective window .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point activ@@ ates , charges &amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay if you select the next image and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; when closing the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window is larger than the image in the window mode , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can configure &amp; cu@@ ddle show ; set up only some of the file types that can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is enabled as default .
specifies whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 1 .
change the keyboard short@@ cuts for the various operating modes of &amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser .
this option allows you to switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in one window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
reduce the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the filen@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo processing based on the &amp; digi@@ code ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ code ; project .

the best way to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions to join the developer mailing list from &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you so much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that make the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; change . to access these settings , you need to select in the menu Settings dialog box ; the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
in the area of exposure indicator , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should indicate the colors with what you want to indicate . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and exposure to a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar on the right edge providing you with important information and actions on the selected images . you can also find the same page strip in the image processing . you can view it in which you click on one of the five tabs :
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes as images to scan and save .
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes as images to scan and save . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving any image or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of the support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set to the command line from the command line , with the command chan@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner you want to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; quit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not handle these options particularly .
to scan an image , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan range for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit in the window .
when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
when a preview is displayed in the settings before saving , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . when the Save is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en will lead to a demoli@@ tion and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image , if desired , before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; channels ; images save . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before each scanned image . if &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; this is automatically saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a filen@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save option without asking for a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as the default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this by using the button .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for automatically storing images and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is counted up every time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button Via starts the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings dialog displays the dialog for setting and closing can be used to quit and quit .

you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and selecting Global Keyboard Sh@@ ort@@ cuts ... Select the short@@ cut key short@@ cuts in the player window and set short commands ... Select .
you can set up existing multimedia buttons in such a way that they as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short commands work . this makes your keyboard to the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general features , most of which can also be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section is comprised of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ CO@@ P function break may look like :
Amar@@ ok supports Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de command line options ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some command line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all required modules are available and use k@@ dialogue so that the user knows why a script does not work .
beg@@ in require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialogue --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the scripts / templates directory , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow external programs and commands to be executed . usually the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . for this reason , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure switches the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be saved .
track@@ Change signals that a new play is all@@ u@@ ded . the script could now ask for more information about the new piece using D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example , the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a custom menu entry is cli@@ cked . to add an entry to the menu , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the Signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to perform e.g. clearing operations . this includes saving data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user and z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the extension amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions :
if your script package is ready , you can download it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist rather than having to work through endless menus . maybe you just look for a certain title from thousands in your collection . mit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collection Browser and quick search will find the piece within seconds .
perhaps you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard to decide , the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically choose the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . this and many more useful features make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to re@@ discover your music !
typically , in the basic folder of the Amar@@ ok sources you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used if you don &apos;t have any trouble during comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options you can enable or disable at compile time using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iler options , certain dependen@@ cies must be met so that they can be used . for details , see the System Requirements section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in developing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to help , you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; lets you set up the setup dialog without any effort . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of Amar@@ ok ; .
in addition , if the option is disabled , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
atmospheric design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . this will change the color scheme used for the tuning bar@@ ometer .
when this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the respective music files . otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ able / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser to run from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; when a browser is required .
use other browsers : specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
when you save the playlist , the current playlist will automatically save when ending &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist while you exit .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
keep up @-@ to @-@ date play when changing the piece causes the playlist to pop up / off to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area .
when changing the context browser , it automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is all@@ u@@ ded .
in the look section you can customize the look &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the section is sub@@ divided into three parts .
in the font section you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting own fonts , the otherwise gray shown section is activated . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist window , player window and context @-@ browser . click Select ... so you can select a font from the selection dialog .
with the Sel@@ ection Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can define your own color scheme . use the selected color selection for foreground and background color .
resume playback when starting , and Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume playback automatically with the piece , with which it has been stopped at the last stop .
setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when using on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings directly in this preview .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box Shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
use your own colors gives you the possibility to customize the O@@ SD color for font and background . a click on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if own colors are not activated , the default colors will be used .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the audio card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector . some drivers still activate more settings in this card card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; browse to music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the selected and their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . additionally , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear in the playlist browser later .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is necessary in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on computer : enter the computer on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then , under port : the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username : password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the load .@@ f@@ m card direc@@ ts the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and if necessary create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send off played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows you to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retrieve similar performers : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters will be retri@@ eved to the played piece . you can view the list in context @-@ browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and no other K@@ DE packages . so you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager considers the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash . after that you can delete the file and create the collection again .
it is mostly because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure all libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version have been compiled . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b was compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this leads to crashes when editing met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then de@@ activate autom@@ . disable if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is a common crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the Met@@ a @-@ Infos , but do not mark it as Uni@@ code . the following per@@ l script resol@@ ves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; File $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : m@@ p@@ li@@ b &gt; new ( $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 , the symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are easily forgotten . note that in some cases , one has to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , please check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to find the correct version first .
there are some ways . most installation problems are most easily clari@@ fied by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please only make a mistake there if you find something about fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist appears . how do music come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the Start sub@@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the list column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column Show rating . click anywhere in the new rating column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the short instructions Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select Remove From playlist from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file to the playlist with the mouse and drop it down there , just as you would do with other files too .
in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , the button will be saved . click on it .
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look after lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it using the menu bar at Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none ! yes , that really is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be : what media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it may ! perhaps use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 deco@@ ders are included ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input aste
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer enables several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mix@@ ers ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you search for the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
you can &apos;t simply send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is for most people the best choice if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound@@ server with highest priority ( real time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure the ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed play . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ gs react the visu@@ ali@@ zations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes and Amar@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all of the components . register to register all of the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask for the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then perform log registers , once as a system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all the m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the path @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / desires , send them best to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run with this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you &apos;re wo@@ ken up by the soft sounds of the music that you have stopped before going to bed .
how to get the current name in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; get the current title when you are on another computer ?
if there is a working SSH environment , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you an interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires your identification in the file ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa .
the visu@@ ali@@ zations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer opens in an independent window that can be changed in the size .
the combination of C@@ trl + Right mouse button represents a piece in the queue order in the queue . pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the symbol in the system section of the control bar ?
click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser to display .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after the launch of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on audio CD in the menu . a file browser will pop up with multiple folders . for normal reading , change to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , instead , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .

basically , this fits the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece has been played . the more the piece has been played , the less influence has every single evaluation on the overall result .
you can enter the evaluation for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column heading in the playlist window . then you can change the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and editing : select review or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the Edit metadata dialog .
the developers do not want you to tell you when to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publication plan that is not matched with the short @-@ term fixed map of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . disable the option icon while playing in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . choose Settings tool@@ bars ... and make the desired changes there .
download a design or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... appearance context @-@ browser design , click New Design install ....
the icon was similar to War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) logo . to avoid difficulties , it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or Navigation Pan@@ e allows you to monitor and check from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing the Kon@@ quer@@ or . launch kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click the Settings button ( the top one ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the pop @-@ up menu .
audi@@ osc@@ ale is a free service to the information on which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . audi@@ osc@@ ale is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and thus also caused a lot of error reports .
presumably , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; newly installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
you probably have to install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same is true for x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you have to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without shr@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : simply use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok .
I receive the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time must be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
you will receive the error of There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and run it as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how to use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
setting up the settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio output you enter the device . typically , h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second one .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; ct@@ l.@@ t.@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter the direction dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sampling rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick on sound card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not further looked after . of course you are allowed to take this problem by yourself ! if you would like , you can get the new so urgently needed super@@ visor for Arts : )

playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the wealth of functions deter you , they are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , the navigation pane is on the left . in the navigation pane , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context @-@ browser .
the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be customized with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and artist . these three sub @-@ windows will be explained later in detail .
if you already have earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used , you may notice that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information presented there are now in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; also , the information can be viewed in the Statistics window ( Extras Statistics ) .
the music window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first area in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to see the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ bra@@ in@@ z database .
below the Musi@@ c@@ bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current piece . you can see here how often and when the piece has been played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
the images can have arbitrary names but images with the word front in the name are preferred . the context @-@ browser will also show cover images that were either downloaded with the Cover Administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next area , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ ded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pieces are the favorite pieces of this performer . this section shows the five most rated pieces of the current interpreter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can set which information to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . to do so , right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be worked out and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if not yet a text script is running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group Artist - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist and there will be a further distribution according to the respective album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among different interpre@@ ters .
group Artist / Year - Album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the artist is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Artist - your pieces will be sorted by genre first and among them by artist .
group@@ ing genre / artist / album - this setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ capture your collection once you have something on the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while .
directly under the toolbar , there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes for using this filter can be found in the section about the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter there is a selection box with which help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours to a year .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will get the following options .
load - This inserts the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
app@@ end to Play@@ list - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will get the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces into the queue . this will play you next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces to the queue for transfer to the Media Player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player browser .
burn all pieces of this artist / burn to CD - This will result in the selected pieces to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or as audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more items .
( n ) Move files to the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark as a compilation - Mark@@ s the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among different interpre@@ ters .
pick up the compilation flag - Chan@@ ges a record selected as a compilation back into a normal album . after that , the album will no longer be displayed with different interpre@@ ters but again under the associated interpreter .
the playlist browser makes it easy to deal with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes Smart Play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . this use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created Intelligent Play@@ lists are possible . click on Smart Play@@ lists to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for connection from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list Artist . if you are done , click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transfer is finished , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive binding for your iPod .
the tool bar is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a entered URL . for example , enter / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press Enter key , you can access music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping the Shift key . in that case , holding down the Shift key may be helpful : this will automatically insert random files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired position . as soon as you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . in order to reset the filter , press the return button until the text field is empty again .
when typing blan@@ ks separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
when you enter OR between the search terms , search for entries containing either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then close the search term with Griff@@ on foot@@ prints : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries found by Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you may also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a certain search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variations at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR Score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this is looking for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not have the comment bad .
you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key and then click on the entries with the right mouse button . the entries will then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist .
next , the buttons will follow and restore . this allows you to und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar is a unique , magni@@ fici@@ ent analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you get in the Player Window on the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the toolbar , for example playback control and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and selecting toolbar buttons ... Select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for chance mode and playback , a sli@@ der for the playing position and the playing time of the current piece are displayed .
you can also hide the status bar . disable the status bar option in the general settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist .
clicking on this entry will open the Visu@@ alization Plugins window . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
this entry contains a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the Cover Administration is a useful utility for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the Cover Administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the performer on the left .
with the View menu you can choose what should be displayed in the Cover Administration . select from :
the queue management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you still have more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , a number next to the title appears in the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 will be played first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ specified ( the details to set up these play@@ lists later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds more random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audi@@ osc@@ ale ) . this mode requires some pieces in your playlist . you do not need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile so that this dynamic playlist will work .
double click the playlist you want , drag it into the playlist window or right click it and then select Load . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist , so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playback directly . the playlist will start with an empty playlist and you will need to add at least one piece of yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added to the next piece of play , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , check the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point .
the New completes the current playlist and adds new pieces according to the dynamic mode . edit playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
right clicking on a dynamic playlist gives you the option to click Edit . as a result , the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist .
enter here any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique in order to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the pieces already played will be removed while resp@@ ecting the settings .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each piece played . if you set more than 1 here , then the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right side have been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists you have crossed .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on it .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on the script . after you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you no longer wish to use a script , you can delete it . then , select the script to delete , then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please refer to the Write section .
the dialog window Visu@@ alization Plugins is used for activating the available visu@@ ali@@ zations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you need to create an audio CD . to track the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that when you re @-@ en@@ code to MP3 you will get worse quality no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD is created by a los@@ sy format .
in this dialog box , you can &apos;t do anything . please wait until the machine has finished the burning process .
this Quick Start will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to track the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and have the source CD inserted in the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please choose Extras , copy the CD ... from the menu . you can now see a dialog with possible settings for burning .
after you &apos;ve made all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you can now see a dialog that looks like this :
in this dialog box you can track the progress of the copy process . as soon as the reading of the original is finished in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to which the data should be burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run @-@ through ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all features that are also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore , &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality for burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio encoding and for dealing with audio streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis profits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dek@@ oder and En@@ co@@ der modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ MPEG , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : additional libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ MPEG , for example , it is possible to de@@ code WMA files to burn them to an audio CD .
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . it can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without Norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the in@@ significant effect that the music pieces will play differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically re@@ play all the videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to rel@@ o@@ ad recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new filen@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As will be displayed with which you can select folders and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file Save .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what has happened . you can then choose between saving and change . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what should happen with it as if you were called for each project file closing .
includes all open projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for any un@@ saved project will be asked what will happen to do so as if you called file closing .
when you view this entry , you can select files to add to the project through the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you enter the files directly from the top view in the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; to the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is this ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears in an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful if you do not use files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session will always be included even if this function is not used . it is designed for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders already present on the medium .
this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function does not remove any files from the medium , it only bl@@ ends the previously imported files .
this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD which you can then burn later on . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this also allows you to create a copy of a DVD , which you can then burn later on . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . also , the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD + R ( W ) so the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write modes over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burning a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings and even options for changing size and trimm@@ ing black borders .
this information is displayed in the table of contents and contains features of the medium , such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of toolbar icons of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is checked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their content is displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the table of contents enables the selection and pulling of files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the head@@ line is a narrow@@ er area that is only visible if the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it only looks nice and separates the project view from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard layout further below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; Setup Wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this you need to set up system administrator rights , so you have to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work immediately . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script , for example .
to use the D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task will be decisive , which of the accompanying programs will give you a default .
in this chapter , we assume you are using the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to be able to use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions common to all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like copy@@ CD , format DVD and other features for creating new projects .
void copy@@ .d@@ v@@ d ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void format@@ ted ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ ls ( K@@ URL : : list of ur@@ ls , Q@@ String Sel@@ ection ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; it is easy to read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in mp3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder which is installed on the machine .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that en@@ code these WAV files ( comp@@ ress ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) are currently supported ( these encoding packages must be added to the program ( if installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in wa@@ v files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed in the MP3 or O@@ GG format or other formats such as the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must be done now .
for the second step you need to have l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ og@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders . all of these programs are generally available for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything yourself . however , only the Ko@@ di@@ erer packages must be installed that are needed . if , for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass any copy protection . if not the firmware of the CD ; / DVD device does not handle protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass any protected audio CD ; even do not b@@ ypass the mechanisms of copy protection . just avoid buying copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily use of reading a &amp; CD ; explained on the hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface that you will stum@@ ble across in the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the step by step example , you will find more information on how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for configur@@ ing the program .
the CD@@ DB requests the CD data according to the set @-@ up of inquiry on the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be established . )
start reading and - if a encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup Guide - the encoding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the default . it must be noted that previously the encoder in the encoding settings tab was configured in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages ( such as protocols , pi@@ p@@ ses ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog from &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as encoder , for setting up the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , coding and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
under the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied with most distri@@ butions free of charge , but there are open license issues
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playing equipment is present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression ratio approx . 5.5 . always needs 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression ratio about 11 . 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music from you@@ ths , portable devices and car oster@@ e@@ os . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have absolutely the highest quality regardless of the file size , then select this setting .
the CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched through the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here . the manual or help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; add titles to the keywords ( english : tag ) when enco@@ ded MP@@ 3@@ s with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer . it is to be noted that this is only spoken by text : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , N@@ ames of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( editor &apos;s note ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information that is public on the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( bog@@ ged ) address than the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only be the programmer knowing the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator is set up for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the nearest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more about it , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . please note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this hasn &apos;t happened yet .
to save the selected wa@@ v files , the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) are on the tab to set the encoder . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab themselves .
the encoding package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the encoder can be used . this is also required for pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a encoder , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD disk , read and write true on it and if both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio @-@ enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give you tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will launch the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 sh@@ outs ( tags ) .
you need to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine since it is considered to be not totally free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permissions on it ( eg by trying to copy something into the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that is probably only done once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each CD &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ ders to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to change it every time you read a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name will be transferred to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , the effective device name can also be specified . if the drive can be accessed with other programs , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device desig@@ nations for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
here there is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is left to be left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
just select with incomplete information , so that you will be informed when information is missing for generating key words ( tags ) .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is simple , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately begins reading the &amp; CD ; . this is associated with low risk if you are later un@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filen@@ ames or tag entries , they can be easily changed . the directory or file name will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , please note : if you want to enter all manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database first . however , this is more than 6@@ 20 MB big , you need to choose between the two selection fields , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data query , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB servers : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org page and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed among the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equally as far as the server is concerned , as many fire@@ walls are blocking the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 because the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example we do not want to transfer data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box .
simply take the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore simply try himself .
CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : check this to the CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . this can be useful if there is only space on another drive . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files .
enter it as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be fl@@ atten@@ ed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as already mentioned before , this is an attitude of very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of subsequent change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded wa@@ v files : at a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad @-@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
this is , we just have the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as standard for any reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is structured , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process of which is described in this section , must be repeated for each er@@ asing &amp; CD ; repeated .
since we use one &amp; CD ; use which is not yet in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data collected by fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; enter data manually instead of removing them from the internet . comments will indicate the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; output of the author of this manual .
if this has not happened yet , then the &amp; CD has to be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only if the CD ; can be identified as audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , look for help in the Questions and Ans@@ wers section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the CD ; successfully obtained from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window , and you can select the database entry in your opinion best to your &amp; CD ;
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also manually trigger by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need to connect to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the sample on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the bottom comment field can be used for individual comments individual each piece , the commentary field of the album is used for comments that are common for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and on only 28 characters for the comment section . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least to what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set on the encoding settings tab ; see the section &apos; Core Settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the encoder to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the CD ; in this example this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p , for example , can be found under Rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after choosing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you get back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second part . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list .
note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the tracks that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece to or off . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
if the selection process is selected by clicking on the selection process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the entries and track down what is going on .
click on tab orders to switch to the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to check orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message tells you if you try to work with a code that you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment # 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into MP3 format . this allows reading and encoding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has found no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code . the result is unclear . the computer used with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem at the simultaneous reading and encoding ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short time is displayed in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
today , if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions , however , already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; install the k@@ de@@ multimedia package from your distribution . if you are reading this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is aimed at people compiled by source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different map maps of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the Help menu was cli@@ cked after the initial startup of the program without any clu@@ e as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; whoever wants to add or modify something useful , may do it . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore in agreement with this proposal .
strange if you have succeeded in obtaining the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er von &amp; k@@ de ; beside others , it has a real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time collection of texts also some features that others &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color so that it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to mid @-@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files ( properties or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the process used .
session support . when you end a song while playing a song , k@@ mid starts again with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this works also with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the toolbar , select the Play from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start once you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( several pieces will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece is played , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and driving with the controller .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly , you can click on the arrows left and right of the template and thus change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar looks like a print on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be saved in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and others do both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events should be displayed and even better : the type of event is automatically determined , which a song is used , so that you do not need to manually set the entry automatic text selection . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to set an event type , select text events or properties from the Settings menu . the same function also has keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that summari@@ ze you . these are played by the series . in this section , you can use how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the Coll@@ ections menu under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and specify the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specifying the name for the new collection .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the winn@@ ings in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection is not saved . remember that when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song by button Add . it appears in turn the file dialog with which you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to Collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
when Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs will be played . when you select the series from the menu sequence of the Coll@@ ections menu , the songs will be played in the order that they have been added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the Next song button , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the button Previous piece , the item Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete , and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is not saved when leaving from &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI map transl@@ ates General MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano type into events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et , thus getting a trumpet sound when playing a piano .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps , so you need to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all required conver@@ sions for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the Key@@ map section which may appear as often as desired . but the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &apos; Name of Key@@ map &apos; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &apos; Ano@@ ther Key@@ map &apos; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email so that I can in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section describes how the patches of General MIDI can be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order , nor leave any row for one of the 128 instruments .
for example , if your keyboard does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun . to do this , enter the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the note 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that the term drum patch refers to a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist ( drum , pel@@ vis , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to indicate how sound is displayed on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of the lines is very important , as well as its presence . so you need to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple keywords for each channel and instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are mainly used to map tones to the percussion channel . see for example the supplied key@@ maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swa@@ p the first and second channel , please do so in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped onto the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will be used with the name Name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will change the patch on that channel . in this case , patch x will always be used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio specifies where pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der event with the value n , it will be converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM indicates that a pitch is supposed to play a pitch with the value 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two sounds up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find it in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the knob does not light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played tones . select View from the Settings menu under the point channel view : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed played by a song . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , etc . so that the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you have to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
OK , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; Drag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder that you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
by default , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have an &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when playing a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I play a Kar@@ aoke file ) , only in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window change and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you only want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection , turn the Automatic Add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ D.@@ M. , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. first you just want to play the first file . so , set automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. Your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , I encourage me to further program and program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; MÃ ¡ laga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; MÃ ¡ laga . at the moment I am in the third year , so I do not have much spare time for my hob@@ bies but I try to collect MIDI files , make music and prove sentences .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me feel happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kar@@ aoke file from a local group , I will be among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; list ( if you want to ) . before sending a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I may have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and no one gets money for it . I would like to stress that I only want to further programming because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ash@@ i I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .

and of course , thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and view images . you will also find links to sites with additional kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound@@ card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear any music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on , as well as playback of DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called do@@ cking windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned .
it is possible to save preferred links under the Book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played one by one , then you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you click on an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the associated entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the various files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / directory can be edited by an editor , but also by the application itself .
after changing XML files , you have to select the same playlist from the menu and select either the Edit Mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without having to match the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during startup and ending can be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to enable a different animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will be aware of the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup needs not to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be disturbing during the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; mim@@ ic ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ hibited &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / k@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / notes ; / smil@@ ed ; In the source package of &amp; KM@@ Player ; are supported in the test / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L which are supported by &amp; KM@@ Player ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog from &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the toolbar of KM@@ Players . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog from &amp; KM@@ Player ; All needs to be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , such as setting up the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how to play a &apos; flash &apos; using the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Flash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even include the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to enable the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module must be specified as a service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is used in a console application and searched for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . the started process is called cra@@ p player . if no errors occur here , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
in order to always have a predefined back@@ end for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , it must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should reflect all og@@ g files :
&amp; KM@@ Player ; can be played by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port should be used . there , ports should be detected , of which one is selected . the encoding must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :

are there any hints on how to qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to be executed as root user after the device is plug@@ ged into . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; kick .
L@@ ate@@ x ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be used on the pack@@ et &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components may be included in the Linux / Linux distribution . the installation should include the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; ki@@ le ; project includes some already compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact via the box should be made .
if you have any questions or if you want to compile and / or add extensions , please refer to the Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; -@@ Environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and customized access to all &amp; latex ; programs . furthermore , the easy to use wizard , the &amp; latex ; -@@ Reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and to learn its possibilities the hand@@ book should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly by reading the chapter Working with the Editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; begin .
for latex ; is the right pron@@ unciation : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is ; difficult to use , can also use a lay@@ man ( in@@ lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port@@ .
while here is only a good overview of &amp; latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to do so . to master natural latex ; good books for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the introduction contains at least the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick Start Wizard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) provides some possibilities for creating the document . you can also make some settings related to the document .
document classes : this describes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ log &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
encoding : the encoding of the system is set . modern systems are increasingly using the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; latex ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for latex ; for inclusion , they can only be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) .
new users now don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is simply a brief description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; If you see larger areas of a green text on the screen , it is very likely that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , it will be spar@@ ed by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you time and time .
with the automatic completion of the surroundings , a new command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) is created by &amp; Ki@@ le ; the command generates a blank line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the box settings ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by one click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI is created , file can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI , file &#91; specified D e V ice I n@@ dep@@ File &#93; &#93; was created , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; latex ; -@@ source .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the commercial output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the check box , the elements of the DVI , file with the editor , and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file has been cli@@ cked , becomes the corresponding section in the &amp; latex ; source search is the exact opposite of it .
master Document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , the work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set about project project settings .
quick mounting : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
video surveillance : in this mode , the DVI @-@ file is called , and there is no call from &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after the quick installation .
when viewing the Edit toolbar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for quick inclusion of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the quick link of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands for sub@@ division are :
the further drop @-@ down sel@@ ector is available for items such as keywords , foot@@ notes or references . the available options include :
name : this command creates a name for a section , an image or a different element .
reference : used for reference to a specified name ( selection over a selection field possible ) .
when using quote a drop @-@ down list is displayed with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are necessary editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down sel@@ ector with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ e.@@ e is used for the specification of the font size . you can define the fonts for the main text , the base notes , etc . there are the following types of fonts available :
when calling &amp; ki@@ le ; two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch .
the brackets after the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font size . if the font size is not set at the beginning , this can also happen later in the text .
once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; latex has to be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the menu building or the button quick construction .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling .
if the compilation of the document fails , it should be sought after the errors . if this is not the case , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be followed .
an environment ( eng@@ l environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns are supposed to have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will then allow the change of characters within the environment .
the changes are supervised only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , bold pressure , passive pressure , sub@@ divisions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for ital@@ ics and is valid until it is closed with a \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment .
\ \ quot@@ a : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; latex ; -@@ mark@@ up language was presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be performed . to do this , min@@ d. a quote , a few places in the grease and passive pressure and a poem are used to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , editor view or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . the window must be closed with an external viewer .
once the DVI , file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to an &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ dep@@ . ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI , the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed by file ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI to other formats . once the DVI , file from the &amp; latex ; source code has been created , the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar .
the pre@@ text search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; bin@@ aries . for this purpose , just setting up Modern under Settings Ki@@ le ... Tools can be selected .
to perform the pre @-@ search query , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source text and then be cli@@ cked on while searching . the jump to the corresponding location in DVI ; the viewer then follows .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; - Document the corresponding &amp; latex ; - Document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line .
if the use of Quick Configuration does not open , a fault can be present . if an error is present , it will be displayed in the logging file or in the message window .
the logging file will detect the source of errors in the source text . in the editor , the buttons of the previous La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ne@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used between the errors . the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears . to view the faulty line , the error in the logging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; ki@@ le ; jump to the er@@ ron@@ eous line .
when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window to select the template to be used appears for the document . the default options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can either be written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document .
high @-@ quality users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates can be created in &amp; boxes ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file can be opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting file template from document ... Create .
when creating a new document from a template by file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings Box ... Settings can be set in General .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are sub@@ stituted by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { items } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps must be completed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard ones .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files . if a simple way is used to create a template , you should search for one on the Internet and get through the steps described below .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; dic@@ ate ; can be done in the menu tools directly from &amp; ki@@ le .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and its possibilities , the hand@@ book should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with the reading of the chapter Working with the Editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; begin .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical and latex ; command reference which can be called over the Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex . this means that in this way , when you click \ \ par to \ \ or \ \ big@@ Excel only \ \ par is selected .
when drag@@ ging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse different kinds of source code and highlight these . for example , the &amp; latex is different ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color .
many wizard can add additional boun@@ ce marks . it is a separate type of book@@ mark within the text . the items edit buttons or the corresponding keys allow the jump to the next or last jump brand . thereby , this jump brand will also be highlighted so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character .
editing is probably one of the key aspects of using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent opportunities offers , in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; -@@ Source code adds always many environments and groups and therefore support &amp; ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection .
select a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only explo@@ iting thing in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two blank lines .
choose the word under the current cursor position . this selection has also an extended meaning as this command also includes and latex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands with a return stroke ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , it can be removed first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; ki@@ le ; provides the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers with own commands for a faster possibility . under Edit Removal are the following commands to delete the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to edit output paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in latex ; therefore &amp; ki@@ le ; for further orders under Edi@@ ting Environment for a possible simple work with &amp; latex ; .
this command jumps to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command jumps to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the location of the environment .
if the cursor is set before or within the \ \ begin { environment } command , the cursor will jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can be quickly lost . this command closes the most recently opened environment so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special orders for the &amp; latex ; groups that are determined by bra@@ ces { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from working environment .
this command jumps to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the welded clamp .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing bracket .
if the cursor is before or behind the cur@@ ly clip of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted group par@@ enth@@ eses , quick overview may be lost . this command closes the last opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple quotes are used as bed for use . for the practical implementation , the character is used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; used for two simple quotes . &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; knows this case and leads to two closing statements for latex ; one .
this automatic entry of the double quotation marks can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
you can also use custom settings ( e.g. n@@ em@@ german or french ) and thus German or French quotes . many other languages are available .
when pressing Shift ; Enter key &amp; ki@@ le ; enter an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , add &amp; kick ; not just a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
complete the current line with \ \ \ \ with a closing line break within a single table environment .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or custom environments . these can be added under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set@@ ting up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables environments and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . while pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; ki@@ le ; after the next tab@@ ul@@ ator in the above line . although this tab does not have the corresponding one , add &amp; ki@@ le ; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ator .
although &amp; K@@ ate ; already offers a good source code completion , it has been added in &amp; ki@@ le ; three different modes are built @-@ in . three of them work according to need and the other two are for automatic processing . all these modes can be set for different work modes under Settings Box ... can be adjusted .
at the beginning a new environment will begin with the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and thus the complete list of letters is removed . on the other hand , the list can also shrink by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command . alternatively , from &amp; Ki@@ le ; jump tok@@ ens can be inserted , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by using the jump stamp Next jump brand and the desired parameters can then be inserted .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set@@ ting up ... ki@@ le ; complete settings can be made to these lists . you can choose different W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ listings for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands as well as guar@@ dians of the general language use .
the command mode is not useful for the execution of environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the execution of the execution mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for the completion of environments .
the command to open the environment is automatically inserted and \ \ begin { . after that , the environment can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key .
once this is done , the environment will be closed automatically . as soon as &amp; ki@@ le knows that it is a list environment , it will even include a first \ \ item command .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set@@ ting up ... ki@@ le ; settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the reminder list for the completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands .
the lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le . the lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le can be executed as an example of an ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l file , for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word processing mode is introduced over the menu item Edit , or the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + Alt spac@@ eb@@ ar , the letter L will be replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
great W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter books are not helpful for automatic processing . however , it has been established that many of them are written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter .
this mode can be set up in the menu Settings ... Ki@@ le can be executed in full order . here , too , the threshold value for the ad placement can be specified .
the complete backup files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ lichen home folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the Graphics dialog boxes design the inclu@@ sions of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be taken into account .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted to ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
in order to examine the results of the work , you need to compile the source code . all building tools are group@@ ed together in the menus Cre@@ ating comp@@ iling , creating conver@@ ging and creating views .
for comp@@ iling the source text for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the keyboard short@@ cut Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be viewed in the default viewer by means of old ; 3 , using alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file and used by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project is being asked about the Project New Project .... The following information for the project is being asked for :
when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function from &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be used in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts is in &amp; ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) with the following methods has :
&amp; latex ; is a fairly developed system in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help for support the users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; they are supplied with many documents . they include documentation for the packages included and a further &amp; latex ; reference .
a complete Ref@@ ern@@ z for &amp; tex ; and for a lot of friends . this is not just a description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) but rather is a complete instruction manual for the &amp; latex ; -@@ commands are included and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting .
because of the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all the files to &amp; ki@@ le ; delivered documents and for a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the advantage is the search for package names or keywords . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or pressing the space bar opens the viewer for the document .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . using the command line interface , you create random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external email programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for day signatures , the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out for the whole day . for each day use different signatures as with the random signature you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl + N File New . this gives you an empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natures section . click the &amp; lt ; empty Sig@@ natures ; and add your new signature in the bottom section .

version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as base . the combination results in quick , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation knows my pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . if we raise it another piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer dependent on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on the symbol for the XML processor and finished !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in the ge@@ at@@ y working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the other folder field .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous and HTML ; files will be deleted every time you have started my@@ pro@@ c .
as already said , everyone who worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already worked knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now there is a great graphical interface for it .
if the opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , then simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book can be found .
when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is defective . please check the reported bugs and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then let the current file simply be checked . if not , delete the current file and select the file to be reviewed by another file - file selection .
if you just want to know if the file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed review option .
to use a D@@ TD ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; D@@ TD ; by definition UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; scheme as well as for the Relax@@ NG examination is required in file selection .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , then let the current file be selected easily . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed by the other file cho@@ oser .
enter the name of the file , as the result should be named , the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not need to wait until someone builds the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI elements .
to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we start with the Edit menu . this opens the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all included plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for un@@ ambig@@ uous identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can select from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pus@@ hes the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after which you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing the members of the team : it is possible to create an event for information to the team leaders when something specific is happening .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific is happening in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone is working on or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project , etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . addressing can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
you can either choose the comment entry from the editor context menu or enter the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment section followed by comment text .
comments can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( R@@ ole ) , the nick@@ name of the nick@@ name of the team member is , role in the project from the following possibilities : team Leader Sub@@ project leader After the area and sub@@ project leaders , the corresponding area or sub@@ project names should be given as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roll names are independent of upper or lower case letters , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , which is D@@ TD agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using the Qu@@ anta settings ... This dialog extends over some pages that are treated consec@@ u@@ tively .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it . entries are :
large / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of tags inserted automatically . normal sized / lower@@ case means the tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of attributes . normal Groß / lower@@ case means the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
include Tags automatically : if checked , tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags , except for simple tags .
start and end tag automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into appropriate coding during ti@@ pping .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for det@@ ecting various types of files . using the Def@@ ault button , the default settings can be restored .
default character encoding : encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting here is em@@ itted by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . however , this setting here is em@@ itted by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates backup copies regularly , so that during a power ou@@ tage or crash the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . also for un@@ saved documents , a backup is created regularly , according to the set time .
preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in one &apos;s own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
set the window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface has per@@ ished by changing the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / ab@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by enabling no more to be switched off .
the place to change behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchronization behavior of the PL@@ - and the source text view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the figure of the par@@ ser nodes in the document , can be adjusted in detail .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action resolved by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
the structure tree settings area can set the visibility of nodes in the tree , the refresh frequency of the tree when editing and how deeply when changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty nodes are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it means that there may be a valid group for PHP , in which the default abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be administr@@ ated . plug@@ ins are part @-@ applications from third side , which can be re@@ used by any other part @-@ capable application , at the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not at a default location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; load the component in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Only @-@ Read &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load the load . only @-@ read @-@ parts usually refuse to load if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plugin : if this is enabled , test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct . select allows saving the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting has been completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implem@@ entations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only a plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inserts .
using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin drop @-@ down sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . normally appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points are listed with time numbers and conditions . normally appears in the bottom dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . normally appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or it divi@@ des the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally it does not have to be considered .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bu@@ gger session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sound according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the current line running . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution continues . happens before a de@@ bug@@ ging request has been started , the script starts with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without providing any information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . happens before a de@@ bug@@ ging requirement is given , the execution starts when a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next statement in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next statement in the script , where possible in functions and include into the script .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to go over the directive and go to the next as if there was no current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog can be used to enter a variable or set a new value to a variable .

this chapter describes how to customize &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how to help you become better .
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you make &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; your simplicity and flexibility makes &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and the tool bar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool bar . tag folders are handy , symbol @-@ oriented led@@ ges of image buttons ( above the editing pane ) , which insert text and instructions more quickly in a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , and also toolbar . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; self . tool bars allow quick insertion of tags into a document without the risk of a write error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the descri@@ p@@ tive language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else than the only element type .
the type of tag is a script function . when used , att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( family 2 )
only valid for class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 )
only valid for the method method . gives the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 )
if yes , the tag has an common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other tag . ( family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of attribute . additionally , it contains further tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
specifies the source code used to execute the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each file ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a only element type .
gives a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a only element type .
all tag XML files must begin with an &amp; XML ; declaration beginning : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ at@@ ly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; to be om@@ itted , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check takes place only when loading Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this tag XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; Load function is described . the file name of this tag XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .

XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via D@@ TD editing D@@ TD settings . this allows di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a file selectable &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = User 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD specification . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... will be created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the keyboard short@@ cut assigned to this action . clicking the User Defin@@ es button can be assigned to a keyboard short@@ cut ; with K@@ einer , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the Det@@ ai@@ ded settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . using this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but on that it is not limited ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even the quick start dialog or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variables in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us attempts to find the script in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replace the current document URL . in case of a local document file : / removed from the document name .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text will be inserted unique to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above listed methods , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field input can be specified , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , directed to the default output . it can be specified what should be done with the output written to the default output by setting the value the selection field output :
if there are many tags in mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group . in the given case there are not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure promotions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action knob at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes , and you plan to use it , enable Open Day , if available , so that an entry is possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered los , rigid , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking on this symbol will insert ; start@@ gt ; -@@ tag in the current document will be inserted .
after creating the symbol , it must still be connected with the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions setting ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to tool bar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators in several groups . open the tool bar set dialog on Settings tool bar . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I want a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how dis@@ connecting the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar must be tested by testing all symbols to ensure that everything works .
backup in the right folder . after New@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder .
perhaps the most not@@ e@@ worthy extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create one &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might want to check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; repository check if someone has already done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . we will leave the first part to you , the second we will treat you here .
# K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , documentation HTML files , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these documentation , e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 documentation section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = func@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tac@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the shaft ( except by reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself .
you will notice that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files will be replaced .
the contents section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file that serves to create context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function should be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily store your doc@@ r@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified in your doc@@ r@@ c file ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation has been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool boxes with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or anyone else . in different places , there is an email @-@ sending menu entry , like D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool bar tool@@ bars with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . to make a European contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this ensures the origin of the resources , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for your private G@@ PG key after their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys you can select one . in dialog New resource you need to pass the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be up@@ loading from the D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool bar toolbar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signature . in case of problems , it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . please notify the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the specification of the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , it can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in XML format . there is the easiest way to automatically convert a D@@ TD into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD menu and converting a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description to use . then the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type definition line : the string that is in ! Doc@@ type tag , like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d will appear
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand and grasp the full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring them close to these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little use brow@@ ses .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all that is marked as global , in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; stored . this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbar , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simply put , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ powers the common use of special tools and samples from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the tabs with information and the tool bar . please check in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the map tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document appropriate entries , such as closing the current , other or all of the boxes , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or run CVS commands to the current document .
right click in the Editor area will lead to a further context menu with regard to the processed document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the tags under the mouse poin@@ ter , help to the word under the mouse cursor or open the file when the string is referred to as a file under the mouse cursor .
at the top end of the editor window are the tool boxes of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool rails are adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements .
the use of tool bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; add to your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now you can insert the data for this just inserted tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog boxes different fields .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open and browse them . in the presentation with tabs are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project Management is a powerful tool , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provides . this view shows all the files in the project and allows the administrator of the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as Add , Remove , Upload or Del@@ ete the files from the storage medium can be executed using the context menu that is displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; It is open to you all possibilities .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only usable for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script .
with this view you can view the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands related to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree opens .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , you can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application system aligned to the content allows you to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project specific documentation can be added , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tabs at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to D@@ TD are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command displayed . the chocolate page of the tool bar is the option of defining your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
another feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the toolbar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if you receive a tool bar in an email , you can backup and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; have , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H before their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; Editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand@@ alone , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now already widely on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then , then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for this the suitable &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of why develop what anyone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only possible for users and developers to expand as they need it for their need .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and has been quickly expanded into a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for more details , see the help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon &apos;s Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not located on it , and the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look in the section on templates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error will be reported .
converts the special characters to &amp; HTML , contained in the clip@@ board , so that they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
convert the text from the clip@@ board to &amp; URL ; -@@ sp@@ elling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to / off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful when you &amp; PHP ; script error messages are missing !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of script actions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
turn off and switch the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the toolbar left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries forecasts or next , depending on the location of the cursor in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents are group@@ ed in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project is managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects you will find the details .
loads a project toolbar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this only creates the name . actions must be set with settings actions ... added . toolbar buttons will be saved by toolbar toolbar , or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar .
removing a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar yet , you will be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the tool bar is present in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment .
allows the up@@ loading of toolbar buttons to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load an &amp; D@@ TD ; which you or someone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the store fails .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the tag menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current tag setting dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the tags menu , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting by tool bar is denied when this tag contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on it activ@@ ates it . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
sel@@ ects the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people using other OS platforms for developing . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document based on the selected D@@ TD ; by using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes need time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the map mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode corresponding to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . by selecting an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window .
the changes in this dialog will affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
set up the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; please find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add which ones and modify the sequences .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse cursor , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled preferably from top to bottom , since , for example , the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the project name in lower case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here is the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) is possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen log will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and templates by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in case of ser@@ vers@@ al scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be linked . if a project is started from scratch , no hooks should be attached .
with this option all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make an accurate selection according to good man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by clicking on them or by removing the box , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be changed in the menu with project project properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles or with the Shift key ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( wild@@ card possible ) , which will be ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional options to the top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be selected using the Options button . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set using the Options button . the de@@ bug@@ ging plugin is described .
upload profiles can be set in the profile window profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by h@@ itting one &apos;s own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration window , you can turn event actions and add , modify or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs , such as the backing of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was open . this behavior cannot be influenced at this time .
to open another project , select Project Open ... from the menu project or the icon Project Open from the toolbar . the dialog Project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and open with ... in the context menu pop@@ up with the right mouse button :
here different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
allows removing the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten in the program . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ safe password on the disk save option is not available .
this will stop transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high @-@ loading profiles can be created to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a full @-@ qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should select from &amp; ft@@ p ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your spru@@ e wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and toolbar . there can be many views in one project , that is , by simply swa@@ ying the view , various files and tool bars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and toolbar .
views can be stored , opened or deleted from the Project or Project toolbar , accessible via Settings toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has to do the most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own way of working .
as already mentioned above , tool@@ bars are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best custom@@ is@@ able via the toolbar . use and Add differ . adding tool bar is treated below in the section Adding Tool@@ bar .
the toolbar and the icons on it can be set using context menu ( right click on the toolbar ) , in which a new toolbar can be created , other actions such as tool bar can be removed , toolbar can be renamed or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog where actions on this or other toolbar can be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar , the entries will also be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool bar and actions on them can set up toolbar settings ... and set settings actions .. set .
templates are essentially a document skel@@ eton , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses templates as a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or copy any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations you set for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions listed at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree below global templates .
documents can be from any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . usually , more specific documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . you can make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in an appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents again and again based on a template but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
create a document structure as you like ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and choose File As Tem@@ plate Save As Local Tem@@ plate ....
as soon as this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree .
select text in your document and click File As template save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drag@@ ged with drag and dropping to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as drag@@ ging and dropping or past@@ ing over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder on the right of the file tree or in the project files tree view , select a name for the template and secure it . by default , it will be saved in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can set he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically connect with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files , or link with them . additionally , you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files laid in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder , click on the Fol@@ der overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led as soon as the attributes have been inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits for everything except the root folders in the template overview . if a root folder would be set so , it would generally disable templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder the bla@@ h would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows previous or reproduced text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying table templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing to right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor , which can be accessed through the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second will divide the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor , a small green symbol shows the default value of &amp; PHP ; source text . it is not possible to edit it directly using the V@@ PL ; it is not possible to edit it directly using the V@@ PL ; to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works exactly like the first , except that the changes both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is active , this mode is active , puts the active cursor from one window to another , while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source editor can be set via Settings Qu@@ anta .... Accor@@ ding to V@@ PL ; View , one can choose between synchron@@ isation after a click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation can be adjusted in addition to the time span . basically , the recommendation is : a small span for fast calcul@@ ators and a large span for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select document properties . this allows editing of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; it is used to reduce the manual coding . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword Key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to create pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style sheet by clicking on the file open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor , by moving with arrows . under rare circumstances , the cursor beha@@ ves peculiar . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and del@@ eting it by pressing a button or removing button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way on the tool bar , as in the source code editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed any other orbit@@ al tag .
some tool boxes such as the table assistant or the Listen Assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of style sheets . in contrast to other programs for style sheets , the search for specific elements is possible and the style of the style sheet can be followed .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , except &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available .

in this command , a partial or entire match is checked with a vag@@ ue called my@@ ME or a specified mode name . &amp; eg ; template matches any my@@ QNA@@ ME that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; my@@ ME &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 will be added to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stop point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically performed when the first template is loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . re@@ taining points are re @-@ checked again shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made a lot of changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts during mer@@ ging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , any number of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the merge and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two persons work independently at one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps resol@@ ving conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files during merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you merge and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today color monitors . if you frequently have to check co@@ de , you will like this feature .
differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left hand side . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different .
if all files have the same name but are located in different folders then you can make the typing work easier by just over@@ writing the file name of the first file . example :
folders 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 - o Dest@@ ination folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o Dest@@ ination folder
the Open dialog will allow you to manually type filen@@ ames , select the file browser ( file ... ) or select a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the Open dialog will mem@@ ori@@ ze your selection and display it next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences will be carried out with two files .
via the folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or merge of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , but a folder is used for A and C , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the other two folders .
if mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active and can be edited . however , it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can do this step later when saving .
the Set@@ ting button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting the merge / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts then immediately . in Open dialog , you do not need to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions , for example . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively large amount of effort . you &apos;d first need to create two appropriate files , load them into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you cannot remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case your original data might be lost .
the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the filen@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Any info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while above the line .
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed through the settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , you can see the color of which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is good to see in the next section ( merge ) .
in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line that separates the merge @-@ column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file does not have rows . if the line switch is checked , the line will be shown on broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has a info line with the inscription output : , the filen@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons jump to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons are used , each difference must also be resolved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed .
sometimes by automatic mer@@ ging or by manual editing no further line is left in the group ; then it is displayed in these lines of the text &amp; lt ; No line in the queue ; displayed . this is only a plac@@ eholder in the event that you can change your opinion and perhaps again select another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a selection you might copy and paste somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflicts ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy this text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources ignore the options or ignore ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in any of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side on , side , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl End , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the window window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the insertion button you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / previous / previous / previous / previous / previous / previous / previous / previous / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Photo Up / Str@@ g Image For@@ ward ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the marking to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ paste ) . if this is enabled , whatever you select , will automatically copy to the clip@@ board and the manual copying is no longer necessary , because you could accidentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix versions use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the line end of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of recently used files will be automatically saved when you exit and restore the next start . ( menu Set@@ ting &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setting up ... )
choose a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also sets fonts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences will be displayed in itali@@ c font . if the selected script does not support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered diag@@ on@@ ally . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences button automatically adju@@ sts an un@@ just color .
if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the Tab key . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted .
if you press Enter or Return , the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is checked , each selection will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , try to find all the identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters are ignored . even when mer@@ ging , white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character \ \ r &apos; and a line slot &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only save a line slot &apos; \ &apos; . otherwise , files with different sizes may look identical in page @-@ to @-@ side comparison although they are different . if this option is checked , this option will be disabled .
in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated as white characters .
by default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in automatic mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is passed .
this is useful if white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then you better use the Cho@@ ose A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the Automatic Sel@@ ection also applies conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments .
these options are discussed in the chapter on scanning of folders and performing a merge . look for details under documentation on directory comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and already exists an older version , the original version will be app@@ ended to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if there is already such a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you must exit and restart , so that the change becomes active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally over the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
the encoding fields for encoding a short note of what the local encoding is . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually configurable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit uni@@ code , but the command command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of command line commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting changes in white characters in text or over@@ sight columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded ke@@ yp@@ ad column . but sometimes you may only see the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply select the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files . current file merge in the merge menu also works if you compare only two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the filen@@ ame of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last file used will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that exactly meets your requirements . you can use this function , for example , to cut off annoying parts or correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only when the command line is applied . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds exactly to your requirements . each input line must have an associated output line .
the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is sufficient .
use this command line for line synchronization to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you &apos;re experim@@ enting with sed , you may start to understand it and maybe you might even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre@@ processing command for line synchronization . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so practically deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the replac@@ ements . example :
instead of sed you can also use something different like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , some details are different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are retained for displaying and mer@@ ging . the other operations only modify the data that the line interval al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus looks like .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ like pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programmers have to edit a lot of files in one folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge whole folders recur@@ sively with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal prior to the start ,
... can simulate the merge and display the simul@@ ated changes without actually performing it ,
... exec@@ utes selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you just need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog File .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
while reading the folder , a small message window informs you about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files that were compared until then are listed .
when scanning the folder is finished , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can open a folder by double @-@ clicking on + / - or by double @-@ clicking on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders then it is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as shown in the picture above , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
for identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . in folders , the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green , then yellow will be yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the synchron@@ ize mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and when the option is synchron@@ ized with synchron@@ ize dir@@ s . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that later both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible filen@@ ames for output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merge ( un@@ safe ) is selected , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and display the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not removed , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
while mer@@ ging , one file will be executed after the other . status column shows Finish when the merge operation was successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , C will be used as the target in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der merge mode , B will be chosen as the destination for two @-@ folder merge and A and / or B will be used as the target for syn@@ cing .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder are also displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that might be ski@@ pped by the particular entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( keyboard short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry : select the action of the current element , or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears that points to the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options to execute , simulate and cancel .
choose Sim@@ ulate if you only want to see what would happen without really making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then exec@@ utes certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select / continue directory merge again or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work will continue with the next entry .
if you encounter a bug , a message and detailed status information will appear . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in any other way before proceeding with the merge .
if some entries have been individually merged , these entries do not merge again . even if the merge was ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered complete . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Set up menu Set@@ ting - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) has now a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that fit the given pattern are displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental @-@ tree . several patterns can be entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * .@@ Fol@@ ders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental @-@ tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental @-@ tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be set specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hiding attribute . in other file systems , a previous dot indicates a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
links to files : when the option is turned off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default .
if the option is turned on , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated like normal folders and searches recur@@ sively . ( note that if the option is turned on ) , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searches . ( note a link to a folder containing a link to itself would lead to a loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default .
the complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that contain no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security .
similar to the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equally large . this can , for example , be useful when the modification date has been lost . please use caution . this option is disabled in default .
activ@@ ates the syn@@ cing mode if two folders are compared and no target folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merge will be selected in such a way that both folders are identical . also , the results of merge files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , the copy of the later file will be suggested as action instead of mer@@ ging . ( this is considered un@@ safe because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this will also affect the normal merge of single files , not only the merge of complete folders . this option is enabled in default .
normally the folder merge view remains visible during the merge of single files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can disable the option Directory &amp; Text Window on the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory &amp; text window .
you probably prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking . nevertheless , there is a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu . you can also merge a single file directly without first having to start folder merge .
this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open files located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders .
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty character &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link appears on a file or folder . then a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permissions or change date . therefore , the permissions or the change date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( This is only possible for local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is applied as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; assumes that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then removes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now Hot Com@@ pare ) are already available . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the diff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs very long and have learned a lot by st@@ aking into sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or they will go on that way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the row is treated as not identical .
the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to easily solve a conflict by clicking in the source and selecting the A / B / C button . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that could store this information .
you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , a different editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c is left ; appeared and the text can not be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ DE on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you will find a list of recent changes under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the base folder der &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir indicates the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used if you don &apos;t have problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of them .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Remove ) copy into the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ insert ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replaces the current selection .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , after changes to these options , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function . )
this also causes identical files not to be copied to the destination folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working areas , change their size , end them or move them . this works both in a desktop and at several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button you can move windows within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other work@@ spaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the blank background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager . if pressed , the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and End . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ spaces .
when this field is checked , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
tick this box lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is checked together with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , eg ; 1st Desktop .
when this field is checked , the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is checked , the current programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only empty work@@ spaces are displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rectang@@ les with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with their default icon and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2 x N ra@@ ster , as is known from p@@ ager applications in some other Windows @-@ managers ; horizontal view displays all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical row , which is very well suited for representation later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , which can display and move windows as symbols or with their contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ector switch ... lets the dialog appear .

this application is interesting for different users : artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of the screen .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded with new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
if you like , a window appears as shown above . the main window of the screen shows the larger area of the screen . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fying window .. The image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged section of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting , the area around the mouse poin@@ ter is enlarged as a movable magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can display and cause a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection screen mode ) or the environment of the mouse cursor at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can customize the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fying window and hold down the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fying window . this is also possible with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key , or use the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it into a file , copy it into the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and more .
starts or stops updating the display . stopping the update causes the CPU time to go against 0 .
select the refresh rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a select window will be displayed . the selected area will be shown in a window .
&amp; cas@@ ually ; automatically uses your set short instructions for saving files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( rel@@ o@@ ad again with the button document in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large , and Sm@@ aller &amp; etc ; .
you can use an area of the screen so as if you use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for various people : from research or artist to web designer or visual impair@@ ment .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter holds a while at the same place . it is thought to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syndrome ) and which each mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click when the mouse poin@@ ter wa@@ its for a while at the same place . it is intended to help people who suffer from the repe@@ et@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and with which every mouse click causes pain .
m@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can b@@ ypass the pain caused by mouse click and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , because of the mouse , pain may also be caused by the mouse . suffer from pain associated with your computer &apos;s use , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet .
to make it clear : even if the mouse helps to avoid pain caused by mouse click , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click as soon as you break the motion briefly .
if the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the move before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the drag@@ ging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent shift requires a little exercise , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click performs .
if Intelli@@ gent@@ es Move is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , wait before it will release the mouse button again if there is no moving of the mouse .
this feature activ@@ ates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these moves will be saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , but can be changed later .
when the sound appears delayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there sound system and here the tab General . there is a sli@@ der Sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times .
when this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the Apply button , the settings will be reset to the state after the last push of the user .
in particular , the smart shift should be switched off at first . if you are used to the automatic mouse click , you will later be able to accept the intelligent shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not display a link will not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rollers that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first of all , you need to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear when you see the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located at the sides of the hole into which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; when an im@@ position is just started . if you use the intelligent shift in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be stopped by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can run a mouse click yourself . this will reset the status of the m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try and m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it . but do not park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . thus , accidental moving of mouse clicks can cause unwanted reactions . safe zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent shift , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text .
the intelligent shifting is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible to mark text , copy it to the clip@@ board , or execute any other action where you wish to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . however , it will probably only cause them problems . here are some advice about this :
do not use the smart move if you are just starting to use the m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click at the one end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the cursor to the other end of the text and pressing the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this is done every time when the mouse button clicks ; the mouse button plays a sound like a mouse click . later you can use the smart move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some exercise .
to be able to use , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X window must be installed . this should already be the case on most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter stra@@ ins briefly . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome , causing pain to be affected .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait for a certain time to start a pulling process before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can also be done with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that lets silent user talk to their computers for themselves .
with program &amp; mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sentences that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text pass@@ book . from the text passages you can choose often used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you determine the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are included in the word tran@@ scription .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
when you turn mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to listen in in the input field . each set is app@@ ended to the default memory . you can select from it sentences that are to be spoken again .
with the Settings k@@ mouth menu entry , set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; This dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the word tran@@ scription page and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the voice output , enter the command to call the voice generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , specify the character encoding that the text will be passed on to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . this command can be found in the documentation for your voice generator . examples of this are in the app@@ endi@@ x .
if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ amm@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardized interface for voice output is provided and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text pass@@ book menu or in the text box text box .
with the selection of Instant Mess@@ ages the selected text passage is directly spoken and additionally inserted into the default memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field .
with the second selection box C@@ lose the editing window for text pass@@ book , you can specify whether the text pass@@ book is to be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
with the selection of text pass@@ book store , the book is saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard any changes , the text pass@@ book is not saved . select Before saving , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book is to be saved .
the word tran@@ scription site contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window next to the entry field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field if this list contains more than one dictionary .
with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
this option allows you to create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are shown as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting the menu bar , toolbar , or a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new position or with the arrow keys and the &amp; alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the default memory .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the default memory .
the currently active set is spoken . if the text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sets of the default memory .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the toolbar is placed above the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left @-@ hand side and drag@@ ging , the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the bottom part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text passages can be displayed with entries . by default , the bar is placed above the editing pane directly under the toolbar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left @-@ hand side and drag@@ ging , the toolbar can be moved to another location .
probably you have not entered the command for voice output properly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the card card voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . )
the festival is a language edition system at the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . the license allows to use the festival for free and to spread without restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory .
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to spread without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ak folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example for the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wa@@ ve@@ form so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows MB@@ RO@@ LA to use free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text to phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax happily swal@@ lows the last character of the text so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option to send data as standard input must be enabled .
the speech output da@@ emon from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ wide voice service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the setting of the voice generator only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to successfully use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but this depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that allows people who cannot speak to print text through the computer . it stores a list of already spoken sentences , which the user can always re@@ charge .
note that there is no syn@@ thesizer . a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed on the computer .
see help : / k@@ mouth ( enter this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system from &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows each application to read text through the &amp; d@@ bus interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmers are ready with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS abilities .
read text ( or parts thereof ) in text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; even if &amp; k@@ ata ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications embedded .
speech output is performed by the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , which uses various background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows the creation of voice output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech mark@@ up met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the speech output service from &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , which offers T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d via kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; with which a text file can be read in whole or in part .
in addition to the bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you will find discussions on &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the node @-@ keywords mailing list . subscribe to the list via ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ notation . the developers can also be found in the I@@ RC ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ sh ) .
before you can use , you need to install and set up program speech pat@@ chers . see also
at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card card is displayed in general .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female ones , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the card tab Spe@@ aker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card reader will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and not yet set up a speaker .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to push the speaker down one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to make your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ z ; system .
select a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boy and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
when you click here , the new speaker appears on the map card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use . go back to the card @-@ card General and check whether voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to be enabled , so that the T@@ TS service can be activated by &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the map to create and manage text orders .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the &amp; k@@ de language sharing system . click on the General tab to open this card . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the kt@@ z ; system . this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the map card will be displayed and you can create text orders and read it . see . remove the marker , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr ends , runs &amp; kt@@ z ; next , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears once the read is completed .
use the buttons in this row to start , stop , stop and resume text jobs .
with the buttons in this row you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages .
the card card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map tab General and cross the voice output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed page . first check , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text that should be read before and select Tools Text from the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ st@@ ressing lines and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . first , check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text you want to read and select the text editor in the main menu . then the voice output should start .
this also works if &amp; rate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
the Noti@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de message system that noti@@ fies you of events you specify . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can set up a message when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC news text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; belongs , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
text is processed in filters before it is sent to the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation , in order to replace wrong spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to b@@ ypass certain short@@ com@@ ings of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the display of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained jobs will be continued .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these assignments are resum@@ ed after the output of the warning .
News has the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you are reading &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page , you can greet with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . every order that you send from the card card orders is a text assignment . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four types of orders are processed in queu@@ es except for Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one of these reads , this output is stopped and finished .
first you need to know that filter will never be applied to Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal al@@ erts , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently , there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there are still further types of filters .
string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be delivered with predefined string replacement filters that enable the replacement of chat emo@@ ti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the reform@@ at@@ ting of messages from &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better comprehensible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . included in the scope of delivery ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with subscri@@ ber selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program sent by the text at &amp; kt@@ z ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the map card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE news on it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter determines that its rules are not true , it will continue to apply the text to the next filter .
when a text assignment , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page . the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the normal filters set up . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further down menu di@@ alogs will be displayed .
for setting of string replacement filters you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text will be exchanged for the respective replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it only has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the string match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ a . the list is processed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries will be app@@ ended from the file to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is used only if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ trl key at the mouse click .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of running programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if , for example , and q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you can only type kop@@ ete .
the string replacement filter is only applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box apply . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in the comparison of words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited to both sides by separ@@ ator characters ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can use it in the di@@ alogs Add or Edit as help to merge these expressions .
XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection filter , you can send text to a particular speaker , which is set up on the card board speaker , or to a speaker with certain features . for example , you can specify that texts from k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text passed to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that the program sends , that sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the properties of the speakers equipped on the map card speaker . with the speaker output filter , you can over@@ write the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can click this with one click on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected to meet the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to display the dialog box selection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your speech settings or delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker selection filter will only apply to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Apply filter apply if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programmers can lend their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so I can use this syn@@ thesizer .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language output API from &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both APIs can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands please enter
open two &amp; console windows . first launch kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have created the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ XML ; re @-@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for the festival web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to make S@@ able work at all . you must do that even if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program is installed x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ewing wave is issued . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure that the encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may possibly be resolved by a string replacement filter .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you would like to expand and expand for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used to support SS@@ ML and for the XML conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech discs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you are using the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for k@@ ins@@ ried or downloaded the tar@@ ball which is currently created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you start &amp; kt@@ t , first check whether speech syn@@ thesizer works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g ; the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g program is to be developed in such a way that the setup of speech discs is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is divided into individual sets . the user can go back punc@@ tu@@ ation or paragraph , repeat , pause or break the output .
if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sur@@ passes , it may request the characteristics of the preferred language speaker . if you have set up a speaker , whose language is English and its gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be selected . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker sel@@ ects , you see in .
if you click to add a speaker to the list or click Edit to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the map card reader device will be displayed . as an example , the setup of the module for festival Interactive will be shown below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival in PAT@@ H is included , you just have to enter festival .
select the character encoding for text that will be handed over to the festival . in the case of voices , the kt@@ ts , this setting is automatically made . generally speaking , Western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you can adjust volume , speech velocity and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some controllers and display this gray , the voice you choose does not allow you to adjust these settings .
some voices like multi @-@ sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded due to their size . when you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with larger memory usage ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up a speaker ( or click Apply to Apply ) .
if this check box is selected , the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr program window is displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr icon in the system section is visible after the start , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not work yet , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the job , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card board speaker .
with the buttons in this row you can proceed in the order that is selected in the list below , forward or backward . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
by clicking on the OK button , all changes to the settings ( also on the other cards ) will be taken and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
only text orders are performed and managed . screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the news types of kt@@ ts , please refer to .
select here the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ z ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or kt@@ z ; can not load the required libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device .
adjust the speech speed here . 50@@ 5 ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ ms ; % approximately the double normal speaking speed . to allow these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to apply the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ z ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you will need to find out which device works with you . in case of doubt choose standard .
on this card , you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text assignment is interrupted by a message with higher priority .
the display of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops them . after reading the Screen Reader , the orders received will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important messages like eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps sending messages and normal text . these assignments are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you are reading &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless welcome someone who just enters the room .
if a text assignment is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , add &amp; kt@@ t ; the audio output in the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text assignment is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings , and the output of screen readers if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; Noti@@ fy messages , start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications .
select this check box to switch the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; disable noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications on which a sound is played will be read by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events for which nothing else is stated in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you have selected Custom Text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the speaker you want . default sel@@ ects the speaker that is displayed as the top entry on the list on the map card speaker . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is set for a specific event of a specific application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the Event All noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the following noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the notification in a file . use the Load button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard for marking text for voice output . this standard contains marks for controlling voices , speech velocity , volume , sex of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the default voice , the festival is used in the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and punc@@ tu@@ ation detection filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sets . this can start &amp; kt@@ t , since only the first set must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order . this allows you to skip or pause assignments on the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly .
here you see the punc@@ tu@@ ation detection filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; a punc@@ ture detection filter is automatically set up as default . you can modify its settings or add more punc@@ tu@@ ation detection filters , but beginners will not be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn the device selection by selecting it . switch off the language selection and select text to read . switch on the language selection , change some features and check how the speaker &apos;s selection changes . of course , you have to have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ z ; then start reading faster with pre @-@ reading , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a very long time ,
you can then pause or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be turned off , only removed . do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing .
punc@@ tu@@ ator Rec@@ og@@ nition Fil@@ ters compare text with a regular expression for punc@@ tu@@ ation and insert a tab character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) at the punc@@ tu@@ ation limits ( tabs are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal punc@@ ture detection filter out of mistake , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .

use of the most appropriate speaker , which has all the features of an established speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ z ; the speaker that best meets the originally set properties .
select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the buttons .
select the properties of the speaker you want . if this property does not play a role , do not enter .
select this check box if the property should take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set multiple flags here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language is available if you know that a particular application is sent text in another language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the features in the field speaker , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the default speaker and then use the speaker that matches the following .
in this case , 0 means for the last word order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .

I uploaded one additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed them and can use them in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / Vo@@ ices . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developer .
on the audio card audio , there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ modul@@ s such as Festival Interactive themselves offer a setting for speed on the map card for speaker setup . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the voice speed are ignored when &amp; t@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for conversion from &amp; HTML ; by &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are quite cour@@ a@@ geous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ forming filter , and set up the speech speed .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with Festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer .
this voice requires Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices of MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , look for the Festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA and Syn@@ thesizer . then the Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output . the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice sharing system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows administration of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings across a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .The device at all shows and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed , installed and set up . if network devices are later added , the drivers must be loaded by adap@@ ting the following files according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the Network Settings option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when the module &apos;s network settings are started , this will automatically detect the system used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which best matches the distribution and the rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by marking the setting non @-@ restart , setting can be made permanently . the next start of the network settings will then automatically set this selection .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you can enter system management mode at the right bottom of the module by clicking the button system management mode .
the entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode . it is divided into three tabs :
the network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be carried out by the Ri@@ der Network interfaces :
the settings displayed on the network can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... can be edited in the dialog device .
default TCP / IP settings are available by default . clicking the Advanced Settings button displays the dialog with further options .
with automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out at the same time with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the manual selection manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address input field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface while bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the console , you can determine if the address you want is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on your needs . switch on an out@@ dated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ...
depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or turned off . switching an activated network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ...
specifies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net that communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a DNS support machine replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will trigger this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution part of the name resolution calcul@@ ator allows you to easily manage this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be ranked by selecting an entry and / or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the Hin@@ ds or Her@@ ds buttons in the priority list .
by clicking the Add button ... from the group calcul@@ ator for name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be added to the list .
from the group Calcul@@ ator for name resolution select one entry and then click the Edit button .... It displays the Edit dialog .
the name @-@ known machine describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list includes a number of entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv@@ 6 addresses . this is still in the test that IP should replace 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The Add New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known host and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known host has several alias names , press the Add button multiple times and enter the alias name .
select an entry of an especially known computer from the list and select Edit ... The dialog to edit scanned machine will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the Network Settings module are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be removed .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in one &amp; console ; install rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical user interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool for your distribution can be used .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages are required with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second section all of them will be discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; modi@@ fiable configuration files will be discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small ( home ) network .
IPv@@ 4 has never found widespread use . IPv@@ 6 has never found widespread use . IPv@@ 6 is expected to be implemented in the near future . therefore , this description is currently concentr@@ ating on IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; Work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact person who specifies a valid IP address or if available , DH@@ CP can be used .
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a range specifically reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own calcul@@ ator ) . the default route is required for the IP forwarding .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it is not surprising if there is a different content to be found in the case of active DSL connections .

the first was to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which additionally provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing . the second aim was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you sec@@ ures ?
before a tape can be used , it must be mounted by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; sp@@ ult the tape back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognize &amp; dat ; don &apos;t recognize the title on the tape , you will be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
if you don &apos;t find it , you will be asked if the index index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was involved . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched through fl@@ aps in the entry for the tape .
before throwing the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; passes by a change of the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape of &amp; dat ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a tape card must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive requires format@@ ting before use , this must happen before you are format@@ ted by the tape of &amp; k@@ dat . floppy disk drives are usually preceded by format@@ ting the tape , but DA@@ T drives are not .
after entering the tape name and the capacity , the tape continues . all data on the tape is lost ! after finishing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured , which can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select View ...
once the backup is started , the dialog box opens for backup . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
the dialog will display the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives on the record for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the check .
if you have confirmed the verification for the verification , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can re@@ direct the restore , the files to be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the menu ...
once the restore process has been started , the dialog will appear for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the restore settings , the dialog will be restored . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process and the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file on the basis of the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index on two types of the tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
for all files listed in backup files , only the files on the same file system are backed up , such as the folder . folders that are located on other file systems can be entered separately in backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others .
to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; files had not been fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
if this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is mounted , the command mt load to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try and dat ; lock the throw at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , when resol@@ ving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically ej@@ ected the tape . do not use this option with floppy spre@@ aders .
if the option is enabled , try and dat ; to change the hard@@ war@@ y block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to share the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The volume of this string is host@@ name : seconds , with the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the tape has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
the program is intended for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users give quick access , for example , on information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files .
moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables experienced users to provide quick access , for example , on information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced features with which help the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the screen@@ shot below , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides functions to easily filter and sort the single log lines of a log file . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after launching , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first , the main protocol file of the system - the system log - will open . if you don &apos;t see it , and it opens instead a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely do not start with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually not found in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or string . the list of the log lines will now be automatically changed so that only log lines will appear next to the filter . in the default setting , the selection field will only display the entry All . then , a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can , of course , select another entry at this point . for example , in the Log File System Protocol , select the name of a process , and then enter the name of a process in the Log File Log File ; this will show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the log lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color than log lines of level indication . the color representation of log lines can be disabled in setup dialog .
if you want to show only certain processes ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can enable the To @-@ New lines option in the main window context menu to display all new upcoming log lines .
to use this feature , use the entries in the Windows menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. to find more current information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named so ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
system V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for the control of the program start when running the system in the &amp; Linux ; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ting . the &amp; Linux ; kernel looks first under / etc following an in@@ it file . therefore , you must ensure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service you want to launch when running the system or switching to another running level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d , etc . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which will only be started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds it .
the default Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . be very careful if you have a bit confused , then get it repaired by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a short@@ cut to any of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how does it start and stop in@@ it really system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will be called up with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be inv@@ oked with the start argument .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server running level that only runs ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . I could also have a user running level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it on that level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ levels or change the position within a level by drag@@ ging it somewhere else . the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this only happens if they extract an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you drag them into a new area . to only copy them to a new Run@@ level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed previously in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be comp@@ uted . in such a case , you will have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to add the system service again .
note : there is currently no way to restore records thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator key to activate the different work areas ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a choice above or below the previous ones .
to move an entry into another runtime , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and paste it into the desired Run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually , press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . def@@ aults are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ time levels and now the machine is constantly re@@ started . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt in lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; intended for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services in these distri@@ butions are started simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not conform to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check that all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as eg , Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) are simply dis@@ continued when their configuration files are not present or wrong@@ ly set up .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that they can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter Custom@@ ization by &amp; k@@ user ; to start reading .
after you have made changes , you have to save them . either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or save the entry in the File menu .
the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and the user group list . for editing , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog User or group properties .
some flash@@ cards will only be displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled user restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users will create a map on which you can customize individual settings . further flash@@ cards appear if Shadow passwords or / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the Card Password Manager will appear if Shadow -@@ passwords or / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes .
this card will only appear if for at least one installed fil@@ esystem space restriction ( Qu@@ ota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a user / quot@@ a group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system with limited restrictions .
the card tabs group informs about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group to which the user belongs can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can be a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the Properties dialog box contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar . the Edit or Del@@ ete of the selected user or group works analog@@ ously .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot from the default operating system , add , remove , change , add , remove , modify , and more .
