<seg id="1">To translate the website you will find in & konqueror; menu under Extras website. select from the drop-down list the source and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated into place of the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. in the best case babifish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, no important decisions should be made dependent on the translations without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated by yourself on the BabelFish site, where you can insert translated text directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains different modules for & konqueror; despite their small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions from & konqueror; by making them easier to use.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information on the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror; choose settings extensions... Open the map card tools and select the desired modules.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard modules from the kde; addons package. please note that if you have additional software installed, you may have more modules installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on Extras exit. then you can view the page that has brought & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes, if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The View Filter module (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras View filters. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use DOM tree view in & konqueror; select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed page. as default, the display starts with the root node of the document, for example: documentItem, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides a further view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various toolbar and text views to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists in displaying nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. tree-Maps allow representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the objects of a object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView, the size is the size of a file or folder, the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be detected even if it is far down in the folder hierarchy. consequently, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap-representation a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have useful color gebanding and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over view color mode can display either depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the image of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space for representation, or whether the area of subordinate rectangles should be used (whereby, consequently, representation errors occur by constraints on the sign of the treemap). furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemaps for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at Treemap in & FSView, this target will not always be complied with. it will draw frames to prevent the nesting of entries, and those frames need space that will then be lost to the subordinate entries if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to split the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this context, it is always advantageous for caption and avoidance of space losses through frames to create rectangles that are as square as possible. the best methods on this are rows, columns or recursive divisions.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry view View on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">You can find the picture gallery in the & konqueror; menu under Extras View picture gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you view the Picture Gallery module, a dialog opens which allows you to set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "the option" "" "Title of the page" "" "allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a rotating field to set the number of thumbnails in each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">Use the box File Name box to specify whether the file names are displayed under the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>

<seg id="29">To display the size of the images below the thumbnails in the gallery, please indicate whether the size of the images is displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Folder dialog, specify where the gallery is stored and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the file selection store in HTML file, specify where the HTML page should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the check box subfolder you can set up with a slider or a rotating field to which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy original images with the check box to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">To use the check box comment file, you can specify a comment file for caption of images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box sele color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original images.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & konqueror; menu under window navigation pane or with the shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the navigation pane of the & konqueror; and drag and drop the music files you want to listen to.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser detection adds a menu entry in & konqueror; add that you can change browser and OS detection for individual domains. this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with specific browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser detection of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Conqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser, change browser recognition into one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the identifier in MSIE for sites that deny access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser recognition to use the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use your own & HTML; - Elements and attributes are correctly displayed with the identifier of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the default browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in detail.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; module, check your & CSS; style sheets and & HTML; documents in accordance with W3C's recommendations and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">You will find the module website in the & konqueror; menu under Extras webpage. you can make the following tests:</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface will be provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course each medium and any card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digiplug; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">You can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE Image plugins interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although digitized; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with significantly more metadata, such as eg; via the camera or lens that can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also digitized; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end user. therefore, you should report problems and opportunities for improvement.</seg>
<seg id="60">If you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes report.... This opens a dialog with an underlined link. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. all required information is already registered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digitize; is a project that is supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to encourage you to respond to other users of & digikam. however, you may have questions to other users of & digikam. in this mailing list, however, you should be able to speak English.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicode; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to join & digitize; to participate, registration is in the developer mailing list. instructions to login to the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & edit; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. simply enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you must specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data abnc is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like to add. & digiplug; will you use additionally as Albenbibliothek. settings digiKam set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder. & digitised; looks every subfolder as album. no picture will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digitize; durscanning recursively the library path in its entire depth. you cannot exclude any subfolders unless it is in hidden folder. you can do this by inserting a dot in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have any photos as symbols. you can change this by taking any photo from the album and placing it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Cue List to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw data backup: if you use the raw mode of your camera, you can handle it. the support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface will be provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course each medium and any card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digiplug; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera is often used as a disk device. the connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives.</seg>
<seg id="75">Digital cameras, which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras, also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos generally are large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated. & digiplug; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that the thumbnails of digiKam can be read reliably. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may need to see thumbnails or the creation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to be digitized is how easy it is to extend its functionality by adding modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digitize;, KPhotoAlbum, Shovmg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much easier, and digitized; by writing a small module to complete a function than the changes in & digitize; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page strips with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop images everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the Albenedin, above the horizontal divider line or to another application window. the only limitation is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords, data list, or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, the filter on the filename only works if it is displayed in the toolbar. which fields are displayed can be configured in the AlbenOptions dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlipiquot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos that were edited by & digikam, are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the alb properties or after the date on which the album was first created. the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. you can also select album Import images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it down. in the pop-up menu you will need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album Collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can group together under a common name. the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos after collection from the toolbar or view albums by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: used if you sort your albums by date with View albums by date sort.</seg>
<seg id="91">Buttons Elder, Average, New Year: these set the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or that of the average of the album. this will first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, instead the date of last change of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first have an album in & digipop; open, the first picture will be selected in the album as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistejn; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu & quot; As album preview, select. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">Digitized; supports entering keywords for individual photos in the section My keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album Collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. of course, you can use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images will be displayed in this album in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can customize the size of this preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">If you open an album for the first time, you need to wait a short while the thumbnails will be generated. you can avoid this by using Extras View all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image is displayed below the corresponding preview. what information is available, you can change settings digitized; set up the albums page and adjust the preview images to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear when you leave the mouse pointer a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important features including all key features of a photo. the screenshot above in the section Introduction to the main window displays such an auxiliary window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all that is edited by & digitized; albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it fits you. image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them. you can view all the features that are edited with & digiplug; you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by either selecting F4 Image Edit... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing.... in the digicode section, you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">You can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of opening. the applications listed there are controlled by the & kde; file assignments for the file type. to do so, and how to customize them to your needs, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing by other image editing programs, there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store these data when you save the modified image. as a result, this information is lost from EXIF and IPTC data such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digiplug; provides two options for rotation. the simplest is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select rotate. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the name of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. remember that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you want to delete a photo from & digitize; delete, it will be moved into the garbage bin of & kde; moved. F8 Picture Delete or Delete If you'd rather want to delete, you can use this by using Shift + Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My data slider; organizes your photos using the data. & digitised; uses either the EXIF date or if this is not available, the date of last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">When you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be displayed in the image view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet down in the date view so that you can only show the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Key words can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. by doing so, you can logically organize your keywords. you can also fold up parts of the tree & quot; My keyword listeem; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The key words are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so you can also use your keywords in other programs. in addition, the keywords are re-imported as soon as digitized; the images are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by using the right mouse button either on & quot; My keyword, or click on an existing keyword and then select a new keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this will be the keyword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and drop it down. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting Cue Edit in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword category; change.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select as Album preview in the context menu. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To make full use of the functionality with keywords, you first have to add keywords. this can be done in two ways: as soon as you select the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword. alternatively, you can also click the preview of the images with the right mouse button and select Cue Points from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way you can assign a keyword for each person in a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">As soon as you have a photo with keywords, it will be shown below the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Remove from the Tags menu. the menu only shows the keywords associated with the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a timelessly adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved using this histogram. to select a timeframe you only need to click on the bottom rectangle of the box that indicates the time unit. this will display all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. it will then appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more in the future.</seg>
<seg id="125">Next to the search box is a small lamp that will be green when the search hits hits. if you click here, the filtering will be deleted and all images will be displayed again. if you haven't found the search, then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press the header OK and the search is done. the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection once again, you just have to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select to edit Search, the form for entering the search will appear again with the search information you entered. if you select as advanced search, the dialog for the extended search will appear to change your previous search. here you will find more rules for searching.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete from the Search context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search will provide you with an extended search form with many search options that you can search in certain fields of & digipate; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the AlbenDatabase. all rules are added to this list with search group / search group added or deleted from it. each option can be associated with others about logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least... Create.</seg>
<seg id="132">And digitized; characterizes each picture by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two pictorial signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar. by using a swellerist, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from somewhere along the symbol of inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and digitize; find the matching images. here too, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it on and move it. move it while you click the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this naturally assumes your images contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geodirectory.</seg>
<seg id="137">Digiplug; provides an illuminated table in a separate window that lets you easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, also raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Add the lamp table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the lamp table and its window open. if you are back in & digicode; main window, you can quickly open the lamp with L Tools illuminated table.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you want to synchronize from the toolbar, select Zoo or move operations on one of the images, then you can compare the same area of the two pictures.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series. if you navigate pair mode from the toolbar, then the two first images will automatically be loaded into the areas for the same. now, use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to see it in the right pane. this makes it easier to work through a series of similar pictures.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, ordinary delete actions work directly from the light table like F4 File Edit....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available in the illuminated table for both thumbnails. this makes it possible for example to easily link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in pan function that you can see on the crossed arrows. to wave the visible area of the image, you need to click on it and hold the & LMB; in the preview mode then both pictures will display the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works just like in other views. just use the zoom slider below the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">Digital inventory management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips how to back up, find, protect and use your images. we focus on the procedures for digital photographers the & digiplug; use. we look at the download, rename, remove, convert, group, backup, evaluate, sample, archive, optimize, maintain and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management records, indexes, categorizes, secures, seeks, transforms, assembles and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value.</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is according to your definition data that provide information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you will need no inventory management to find a certain photo. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you certainly do not use & digitize;. the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving to which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow have access to your photos, whether you want to store them on a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; Note that sometime you need to switch to a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements, such as versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% of the archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files makes a backup strategy and migration easier. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option to save metadata in the settings page of the metadata in & digitised. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which? edited and digitized; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, as you should now assign keywords, captions and an evaluation to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. you start best with the evaluation or rank. this makes sense, because you can focus on the best photos in the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's start with keywords, keywords, as you frequently use in other programs, or proceed categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import cataloguized images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digitised; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images in the right place. the re-sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can simply be done by dragging a sub-tree to another. the changed keywords are edited by & digikam, while it tracks the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">This is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata consists of many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most people don't want to see your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from afar, there is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it more closely, then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandie 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming to have associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others viewing your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him over the motif that you have moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digitize, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as labeling. you can even export it for a selection of images. KDE even provides you with a spell checker.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without navigation system? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of Google Earth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now already with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of exploiting geolocation are countless and will become even more profound in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your trips using pictures with geographical data.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice to use the copyright to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, thus also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information should be stored in the setup page of & digicode; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization may not be changed. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author's title (synonym for author's line): linked to the author. this field contains the job title of the photographer. examples of this can be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author's field, this must be completed as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">If the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others. if the image is a stock photo, then here the group / agency that offers the picture is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not offer protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete or modify this, in the image embedded metadata. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique and digitized; in the near future, such a module will be available for batch processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, board failure, current surges, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can also happen with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, it concerns problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the largest data recovery firm in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these cautious issues have to be handled and you can't trust you for more than a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write a lot more reliable. so it's about choosing the right one.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to mistakes, even if you have just been written. therefore, they use a checksum mechanism to protect yourself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CD and DVD, there is a cheap program called IsoBuster that apparently causes wonders in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slowly burn with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriate format. after that, read the data again to check you. also, if you want to copy the media with a description, date & author and then store it on a clean, dark dry and protected spot on animals. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that these media can read.</seg>
<seg id="186">Your manufacturer's warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives for this topic: Disketch study</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: disks hold the longest if you operate in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. with lower temperatures, the error rate increases dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error, SMART cannot determine this error. this is in particular read errors and publishing counters. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the total loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have backed the files, but these losses can usually be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not make a lot of electric shocks, the devices with computer chips and high speed processors are different. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware age, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against current peaks is overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs some of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug connector. however, remember that not every connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should ensure that all peripherals connected to your system are protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protection devices that also have a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are especially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem. this makes you ideal for on the go.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system against small fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in case of a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore make sense to invest in an uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">This gives you the possibility to store your data and shut down the system. if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare your safety with current disturbances with the costs to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. finally, you should remember to keep all cables before you go on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are, compared to the hard drives at home, however very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data over the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a distributed storage. thus, they are desasterproof.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the calculator. all transmissions are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all of these interruptions remain undetected until you one day can open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not affected by transmission problems at the moment, you should look into the future. you will see thousands of errors per year already in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with record errors on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL compatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon also be available for & Linux; and Windows available.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms the ZFS uses and is also available for Linux; it is still not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% in the workplace systems. for notebooks, the share of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it causes less damage than thefts or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFs and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings of fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that while technology is further developed there is a natural boundary for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel cameras. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result more deteriorated. even DSLR cameras have their limit with 10-12 megapixel. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so you don't make anyone else responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by data loss every year. thus, you can backup your data according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything hazardous like the reinstallation of your operating system, the replacement of disks or the size change of hard disks.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make daily your backups on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget airplane landing tricks: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore DesasterPrevention means always a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as said above, a common reason for data loss despite backup is the panic. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot of two time points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates several snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made. this backup comes from a versioning system closest to the exception that it is only scanned and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time, you will get a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually after you have made a complete check.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, retain original, memory, scalability, media, reinvent images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">To ensure that valuable images survive the next 40 years, that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you must consider all that is being said today with caution and re-assess while time passes. unfortunately, there is no other way to be able to act as a certain vigilance. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should already be answered on the basis of explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards which are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, then store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing the size of the system.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have the scalability with you and want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk has been detected by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBK; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sdc # change the size of file if needed</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software is available, you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. so you shouldn't use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard GIF should replace. however, it can store much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency. PNG can be relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression. this format we would like to recommend you to save your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Default). it manages images in high quality but requires very large files. with some cameras you can store your images in this format. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a license-free and open format format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed on the basis of the need to unify the camera formats. it is now available on the TIFF / EP format and committed to use of metadata.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block quot; technology of the nineties. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer an original of your recording, mostly in raw format, to archive. XMP fits to it because it stores metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems with the link between the metadata file and the image file and as mentioned above, the raw format is dated. therefore, you should consider if you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the cameraman, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For fine editing you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & digitize; edit, then you should add the metadata again. these were possibly cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them only then in web galleries, code in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digitized; in the section adding a photo to an album you will be able to add a description on how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your alb database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, connect these to your computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn it. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When connecting the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all the photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the application are displayed on the camera for each file, photos, movies, music, etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before downloading the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata metadata shows the internal metadata, such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. this information is the same as in the metadata side bar from the main window of & digikam, or image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all. this loads all photos from their camera into one single album in & digiplug;. downloading will not delete the photos and we recommend you to check if the pictures were securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all the photos, you can select only the desired with the standard selection methods from & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download the Selected button. the Selected button can be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New download is available. these images have not yet been edited by & digitize; in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, of course only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you download the buttons all download or download selected albums, a dialog appears with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. the list of the existing albums is displayed in the My Albums section. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digiplug; load the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by deleting the Delete All button. if you want to delete only some, you have to select them first and then delete the selected ones.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you deleted from the camera. so, you should carefully check if the photos were successfully edited in a digiplug; album, before you delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera system completely, you should do this via the camera system, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often do not use descriptive names for the photos. the file names are usually re-used after the photos were deleted from the camera. this can lead to double filenames if you upload photos of different recording ministries to the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was made in the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically every day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The first two are related to the data about the author in the default auto-identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the Exif information in the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the standard format, you can e.g. use the prefix foto-% Y-% m-% H:% M:% S in the editing field. switch to the option Date & Time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filename, you have the option to change the filenames in lower case when downloading. or in uppercase if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digiplug; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitize; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during download. not all cameras provide this information. in the section page bar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, & digitised; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off automatic rotation, use the Advanced and select the Automatic Rotation in the lower area of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made, it can be edited and digitized; these sub-albums are automatically uploaded to the image data. all images with the same date will be loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta data section, you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case, & digitised; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the Advanced button and select the option Dateline-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is to download. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, and digitised, you know where the images are to be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear. select the folder and press OK to start the upload.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a generic term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in longitude and latitude and can be displayed on a map. identification of data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it may be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser that displays the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digicode; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailings and map references. the question is actually more how the data will come into these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, by reworking the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical mapping (manual) and last about manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit. but there are a few that work together with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save these data in gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the module for geographic mapping.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the latitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the sign-like coordinates created by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">The settings dialog is divided into eight pages. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action on embedded preview or start image editing. you can set the default behavior of & digipate; note when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface. also for database synchronisation, this data is written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a byword for author's line: this field should contain the photographer's job title. this can be names such as photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a detailed description of the author's field, it must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for provider: use this field to specify the photo. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency, such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here as this is the picture other & quot; provider quot;. if the image is a stock photo, then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the relevant IPTC rims. this will allow the metadata to be permanently included in the image and not just in the database of & digikam. these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported into & digikam, without going to be lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save images as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the images.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse cursor is in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digiplug; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digitised; preview, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. each file in one & digibox; album folder that has none of these extensions will be ignored by & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the lighting table by & digitize; can be set on this page to the default values. however, each time you open the lighting table, these settings are switched on if possible. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. the option & quot; In the whole image size ladenquot; if you have one then you can get better picture results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select them here. you can turn off the toolbar if you are using image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light colour in the picture. these colors are specified here. in the image processing, this View Mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling, it is meant that the images are encoded in higher resolution of the luminance than in the color transformations. please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality as PNG requires a loss-free algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF Compression you can unzip the default compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality, since the default algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss-free JPEG 2000 files you can save lossless. even if you select the loss-prone position, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of & digitize, image editing was just a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard assumption is that all green pixels are equal. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react to more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels in odd lines, this difference creates a lattice pattern in output. this option draws the picture a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the auto color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if white balance is not set. standard is a fixed colour balance based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed pictures in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top-lights, so the parts of your images are burned down because of the inability of your camera to capture the peak lights, as transparent white to view. the setting colors will create some unusual results as it shows the top lights in various rose shades. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the saddlers.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally do not saturate as fast as green and red. & digikam, and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the unsaturated blue pixels. of course this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you select the reconstruct option, you will have the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1. this can also be done later in the image options of the & digikam; image processing. to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data that comes from the color filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">And Dcraw provide you with three alternatives: bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests, it looks like AHD interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenous Directed) created the quality for me and the paper used by me. VNG Interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Drapw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for color grading correction as you are done during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how these should be given again. there are also LCMS and & digitised; information such as to translate color information from one color space to the other is thus the colors as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in image editing / Color management module with raw files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folder Sets here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have here the option & quot; default squot; for your profiles to be deposited. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your images are color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera creator and model you are using. not all profiles are built in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain color mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw gamma isn't correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to do the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof Profile, with which you can emulate how your image would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print a picture, because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated. this could be corrected manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is pretty obvious which colour profile is intended for. unfortunately, not in the models of Canon. therefore here a table of cameras and profiles will follow these together. this answer is of course not official:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes it possible to see the style for the target: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by providing this interface, & digiplug; many modules support that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and these are then edited by & digikam. these modules will appear as new entries in the main window and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Brief commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) about KIPI modules, you can get the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds are good. the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show a list of all cameras supported at the time on the left. on the right hand side there is a button Automatic Detection that tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the image display mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you select a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera box. you will need to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / min, where you can mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">If not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it is displayed in the main window from the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; images in the trash bin, you can display the conversation of & digipate; by deleting a photo in an album. in the sections deleting a photo and deleting an album you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly edited by & digikam, if you use the option Apply changes in the right sidebar without queries. otherwise, you need to save the changes using the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also sign & digiplug the display of the welcome screen; when starting, this speeds up and digitized the boot process.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setup Beim start searching for new photos pushes & digitize; searching for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digicode;. if something has been deleted from the base folder, you will ask & digipate; you see if it is to delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color schemes can be edited in & digipate; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected from the toolbar Preferences. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, please refer to this tutorial for more information.</seg>
<seg id="337">You can use them to view and edit your photos and for correction and improvement. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of preview and selecting the item Show / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digicode; so you may not be part of your distribution. you can find more information about the KIPI modules in the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, enlargement factor, and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge, including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing will change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used the Save or Save button from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You might need to make a copy of your image before changing it. you can save it by saving file.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by reproducing from the File menu or using the Restore button Recover in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any image editing action can be undone or restored. the last action you can undo by editing or restoring, by selecting Edit restoring from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should make use of the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z to undo and memorize Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB, for a moment on the toolbar or Restore button in the toolbar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions will be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started image editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo in and out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view where you use the Esc key. normally, the toolbar can also be displayed. if you do not want this, you can change it in the Settings dialog from & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print in the File Image menu and get the default & kde; Print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or complete sets. entire image preview pages can be printed from your selection. you just have to select the images with the standard methods and select from the Menu album Export Print Assist. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The digiplug; main window has a sidebar on the right, providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation arrows, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear again.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied into the EXIF and IPTC fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the captions are then stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the Apply button, there is a button. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field of urgency. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the key words used previously in this & digitised.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the keyword search. you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is another relief when entering keywords in a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, they are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all key words of an image are stored in the IPTC-field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only apply to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, if you want to add a selection with a keyword, please refer to the Keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The Keyword filter sidebar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, - Date, keyword and search views. if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and drop keywords. suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword exists already, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and place it on the selection.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar tag. the keyword filter is on no keywords, which reduced the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created it, and notice that it should be one or two, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is searched. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, key word, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an Advanced search through all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the grouping button. the options will then look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors coming from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that correspond to the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons to push for the results they want. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflows. the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management. additionally, you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all of the six criteria listed below, you do not have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB color space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other images are by email or the web where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB functions so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use another color space and have to worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors we really see will be presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all the colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to vibrate my monitor if I decided to work only in sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you're working in sRGB color space or not, you need to vibrate your monitor, since sRGB is based on sRGB. if you work as in the color space of sRGB, then you either have to stick your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you attempt further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, Same, Automatic Balance and Contrast Expand from the Correcen Automatic correction menu try automatically to make the most of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the brightness values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balance: this method adjusts the intensity factor of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. this results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that either causes wonders in a picture or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic compensating: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and light limit tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminous intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a rev of all the values in between. this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The White Balance of & digitised; is a semiautomatic tool to carry out the whiteness of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited since you have a color space with 8 bits per color. so if you can be too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will fail better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu item colors White Balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target picture. the preview will be dynamically adjusted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance, then click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photo has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right up, a histogram shows that dynamic changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shade can be adjusted or dimmed down the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play anstat with the above checks, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The exposure indicator increases the colors, if more than a color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result displayed in white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. every setting of the white balance you have set allows you to save it to a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button returns all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will result in another picture than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image here. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high quality images. however, this encoding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be performed by the subwindow for brightness. a detailed guide for using color profiles can be consulted from the chapter Color Management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colours tone correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and also allows you to save your settings so that you always need the same correction. in the manual for sound correction you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure issues is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digicode; tool colour effects provide you with four colour effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created when exposed a partial pressure to a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photographic paper from the additional light. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar process. at approximately 50% intensity the picture shows what is chemically possible. another upliftment finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it embellish lots of photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition by & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repetitions the strength of the neon light.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual for you to correct the color contrast and the luminous intensity of the photo. you can watch the various color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the opposite problem: a too big saturation. also in this case, the brightness / saturation tool is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool is located to improve exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you need only the range of the sliders for the purpose described here. specify the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, histogram, active channel or selected area. beneath the graph are three sliders that can be clicked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the controls and make sure that the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, you can view the original and preview the image. the preview will be updated dynamically according to the image's settings. the following options are available on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it is possible to set whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear depiction is often the most useful. in this case, the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the top for the dark notes, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for medium tones, often called gamma-values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinpions can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, middle and light tones. furthermore, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. for example, compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden picture as background while something else is to be seen in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later. to do so, the Gimp Levels Format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option Overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the adjustment of the input values to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most meaningful. for images with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode further helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a short panel to the right, e.g. the bright tones, you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and darker the associated image pixel.</seg>
<seg id="436">Preview the original photo is to see a red marker. if you want to shift this marker to the area you want to change, a matching curve is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option Overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if available in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were placed with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digicode; image editing is a tool to enhance the color channels or change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first notice how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line in the histogram shows you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right down: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminance, the image will retain the general brightness, even if you have the option Monochrome as the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating magnificent black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the color. if that is the case you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer setting can save you for later and then load. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option Overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the option Luminance Store is enabled. the original image is shown under (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction capability. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step because color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all sceneries and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at daytime. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and enhances the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepitheliaton: produces warm bright and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold in the leaf tones. this is very similar to the process of leaching a pressure and the re-development in a serum. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepithelium ilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digicode; Apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textual effect has been applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the modified under (2) to be seen. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digicode; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to put the image into a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter set the desired frame type for your picture. throughout, the image is surrounded by a coloured line, Niepce embraces it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), bevelled it with a nice three dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame per cent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture in any place. this is also possible at several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need. the larger the image, the bigger the character set must be. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click the "OK" button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed any more.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digicode; tool template you can put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu Image Template Apply in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there are no limitations regarding size and orientation. however, you must take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for reduction of the file size of the template. if you want to add your template of the template, simply send an email in English to the digicode; mailinglist digicode-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil folder with the button root folder in the dialog. select the folder where you have copied the template files. these settings are scheduled for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder appears automatically. the selection of a folder automatically updates the thumbnail of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button increases the picture below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">It is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image then automatically adjusts the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicode; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but generates, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture look sharper. in fact, it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psychedelic. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapor and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitized images require correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalisation process is composed of only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn results in blurred edges a bit blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">Images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners turn a field of focus while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with sharpening tool. you can use the menu entry correcting sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">The sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. generally, the most useful technique is focussing to sharpen an image. you can achieve more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool to soften with the menu entry Correct softness and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharpen mask is a very good tool for removing veils from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount will enhance the effect. if you make the blurred mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates near sharp edges create.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radii. therefore, you should sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred picture added to the original. thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. this allows you to define a minimal difference in order to apply for an edge of the filter. in this way areas with a soft switch between the sounds are excluded from the sharpen and therefore beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred color filter. the original picture is the (1) and the processed image the (2). blurred masking was used with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The edited and digitized tool refocus an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted filtering-filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than trying to sharpen the photo. this is a better approach than trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese Filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurred mask. refocus achieves mostly better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by refocusing color refocus in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">The Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixies that are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Vienna Inverse of the Gauß's fold is influenced by the distant pixel. this causes undesired results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most of the images, the default value should yield 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your picture is very blurred and then pay attention to hallow.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter if your blurred gauze is' sch. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the palate. note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocus parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all trimming, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not visible immediately, but leave unpleasant artefacts later.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unharshly masking a larger neighborhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp mask must always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practically the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original blurred color image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpening in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The slider smooths the blurring of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour ink provides a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration process. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothing over the picture. a value of 0.9 should maintain details in such a way that no sharpening is needed subsequently. please note that the attention should always be subordinated to the direction dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 only smoothes in one direction. if you have a film granularity or CCD noise, a high value will produce shaft-like patterns. JPEG Artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value matching the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specify how often the algorithm will go through. normally, here 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step width da [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is selected, it should also be selected small. make sure that small angles generate a long term. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integrated stride width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation: the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only minimal. it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to omit it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and load make exactly this. any adjustment of image errors can be corrected with this in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is relatively fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and take a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove image errors with small artifacts. the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artefact in the foreground that caused by a poor film storage during the trip. the original picture is under (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitized; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides a selectable picture filter to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about digital cameras sensor noise, you can read these in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">The following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced Settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">The radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller faults.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to determine luminous changes. if it is increased, noise peaks are deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can't be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically thicker, but also lubricates the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance. if it is raised, the edges appear smoother when it is too high can occur.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use tool to soften with the menu entry Correct softness and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digitized; photo restoration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photographic artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restauration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film granularity, scratches, compression artefacts and local faults that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitalized pictures. the smoothing takes place along the image contours and thus receives the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">Reduce JPEG Artefacts: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, he creates some compressions & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and load make exactly this. any adjustment of photo restoration can herewith be saved in a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and take a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious movie granulation on the faces.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time, textures were used to see an old color photo created with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts which were caused by scanner lighting and photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; tool Hotpixel allows you to remove hotpixels of photos that were created with a CCD camera gem, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw-mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels quot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark picture subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark picture directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the right dark picture to the picture to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will remember the last dark picture and will automatically load it again in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help you to correct the result inside the picture. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durham: an average of the neighbor pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1 dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2 dim) or a group of square curves (1 dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2 dim) or a group of cubic curves (1 dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture can be seen under (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitize; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo formats, can't illuminate the entire sensor area evenly. instead, they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed so that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide-angle lenses should also use an aperture of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise blurred effects arise through movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's film and color or gray scale models of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter using an equivalent transformation on a rough image that was made without this filter. the tool netting correction addresses the transformation with a Centerfilter on an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three more controls of the target picture.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of loss of light at the point of the biggest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which allows an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly a luminous intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the luminous intensity of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target picture with these options. the controls only provide you with positive values, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine readjustment of the exposure of the target image, let the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma look at zero and use the gradation from the & digicode; image editing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction applied to a picture. the original picture (1) shows the Vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a color thickness and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digicode; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree handles the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third grade has a similar rounded effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth grade corrects the remote corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion second grades. with negative values, tonal distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the fourth grade. this value has a stronger effect on the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'Corner Parameters' has the opposite sign of the parameter in General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value re-scales the image size and thus leads to a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightening: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tone or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. best perform this correction as the first. if you cut a picture new and then perform a ton-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent to the fold.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal aid line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to fix the dotted lines. move it to an important location, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the key / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a kissing distortion, the resulting picture will have black corners. you can remove them using the cropping tool in the menu Transformers cropping out of the image processing or via the zoom slider of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs such as front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonal correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating the infrared film of the GimplicGuru.org website which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters of film granularity and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the Add Film Licensing option if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO control changes the amount of film granulation and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">As the filter mixes color channels for the reproduction of infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is shown under (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the nicknames.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; Filter Film Authorization is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granularity on your images. this is known by classic high-speed films such as B / W Kodak Tri-X. in order to increase the sensitivity of the films, the makers mix large silver baskets of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film particle effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless ambiance from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, granular sight specially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although frequently higher values are required, set to ISO 2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film sample effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature images and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large pictures.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the processing is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smoothing 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiplug; Filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage. images whose gradients vary slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect. it's helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digicode; Filter Grave shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; Filter Grave is a fast tool to give your images back with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing on the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, landscape-like landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filter. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is seen by blocks of glass.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave-blocks 2: analogous to the wave-blocks 1 the picture is distorted with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects anytime with the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom blurring: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from one centre. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the image by rotating the pixels around one center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Rangefinder: wipes the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: blurred the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blur of a linear moving, z: B: photographing from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blurring: blurred the image softly in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focal effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shout blurring: blurred the picture by accidental displacement of the pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the paddling pool in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divide the photo into rectangular cells and then recreate it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives the natural your images a wet look. it uses a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. as the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image, it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold with the & digitize; image editing a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it in the right direction by mirroring or turning. the tools for this can be found in the menu Transformation turning or transforming mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how to inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you recover the missing information or guess? the CImg algorithm used here makes here a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select Add Transformers Size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog can be viewed below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for resizing uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with better quality then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digitised; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflated was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any photo magnification can be saved as text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Inflating photo is very fast with what it does, but it can last very long and move a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only an often underestimated operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to assemble a picture. to crop a photo you simply need to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off. this will give you a good overview of how your photo after cutting would look like. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the Ctrl + + X button in the toolbar and the photo is cut to size (Ctrl + + X). use the file Save or Save file from the File menu to save the newly-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview pane, you can change the size of the rectangle by dragging the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as portrait format or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and the landscape width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After aspect ratio cut uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimetres, inches or any other physical size. you can, for example, see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog box, you can set the range for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">Depending on the orientation of the tool, the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the cohabitation help enable you to hide help so that you can put your images together better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic parties are based on the principle of similarity. as the third rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in similarly harmonious triangles on the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden Middle: the golden center is a division that affects various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the petals of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we perceive as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who built their temples and pyramids. artists and architects used the golden pitch at all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more fluid relief lines when you put together a picture. these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirale will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third gel, the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow on this type.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to draw the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye is centred at the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also derive from the above discussed golden spiral. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that unlike harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not a triangular triangles.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirror and vertical mirroring options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button Color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it happens easily that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can fix this with the & digikam, image editing and tool-free rotation. select to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to fix this is to use the function Transformers cropping out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the automatic cutting function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option leaves the picture a bit after rotation. note however the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recalculated. on the right of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Corner left: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right up: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Corner left: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the picture is slightly smeared. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective you get unwanted triangular holes at the corners. a way to clean it is to cut the picture with Transformers cropping out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shearing tool is used to shift a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. a horizontal scaling e.g. will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left. this is no rotation, the image is distorted.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shearing your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angle will be set to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shear, the picture becomes blurred. for a single shearing this effect is usually negligible, but two shots generating twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shearing, the picture has unsightly triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transforming crop out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicode; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore, the formats available depend on your system and, in some cases, of the way these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all the file formats available on your system at this point. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF underneath.</seg>
<seg id="685">Digiplug only shows files in formats that you know. this is done by file extension and a comparison of it with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, the edited file will be edited and digitized; you can change this list of file extensions the & digiplug; accept. in the configuration section you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data compression algorithms for digital images. in this way redundant information is reduced in order to store image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save lossless when specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw picture format, read on Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digikam. in the configuration section you will find further information on how to use modules with & digikam..</seg>
<seg id="690">More than 200 raw file formats are supported. all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coffin. the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="691">Many digital cameras support recording short films. these clips are often stored in AVI- or MPEG format. & digitized; understands these formats and therefore has no built-in options to display or edit movies. if you click on a movie file & digikam, the & kde; settings to play movies use to start the program for playback.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need the photo editing are in & digicode; included. your description follows here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image processing tools such as sharpening, softing-, noise reduction, refocus, unsharp mask, & etc;. use a unified dialogue type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; texture Application quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image. to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertically divide without duplicate. the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontal divide without duplicate. the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview range.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="706">Horizontal divide. the upper section shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="707">'Mouse over 'style: displays the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original.</seg>
<seg id="708">(2): there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over- and underexposure. the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page.</seg>
<seg id="709">(3): the frame to select the preview. you can drag and drop this frame with the mouse within the image and click on the part of the image you want to preview. the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the ability to reset all buttons to your default values.</seg>
<seg id="711">The page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo features: displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo. these data are from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it on and move it. move it while you click the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this naturally assumes your images contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for palettes files. the application can be used for editing color palettes and selecting and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The pallets that are installed by & kde can be applied either for the whole system or just one user. in the latter case, they are located in your personal folder for & kde; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the Palette dialog, you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders by files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is displayed in the pallet view as a line. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">The color is described below the Pallet View. here, the color name can also be changed.</seg>
<seg id="719">It can also be used for selection. to create such a selection, click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there. then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="720">If the check box is inserted under the Color button under the button Color, the color is inserted from the color table at the cursor. the color is either inserted or overwritten another; depending on whether the overwriting mode has been selected. this mode allows you to select by selecting the tick box below the cursor.</seg>
<seg id="721">A selection that was created as described in the last section can be used along with the actions copying, cutting and pasting.</seg>

<seg id="725">Graph viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there has been no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs, the & graphviz; contains, are obsolete & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with just a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphiviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& ktionViewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; - graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & ktionViewer; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & dicate; and & konqueror; (so a change in the graph in & dicate; recounting the graph and representing in & kgraphically;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & kate; open or open the graph in & kpoinviewer; in a & kata; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Load large graphs (currently there are problems starting from about 1000 nodes and a hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & ktionViewer; is a & kde; -program that presupposes the & graphviz; -tool & dot; required for representation of graphs.</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the open graphs, each in a separate subwindow. initially, if you start & kgraphically; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list Last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog File.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more dot; files, the main window looks like in the lower screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the character area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph will be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graphene file outside of a running & kpoinviewer; instance open, eg; in the file browser or on the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & kgraphiviewer; instance or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub-window of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When you start the program, you can open all the graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice as well as change it later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely selected.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be adjusted to this page. thereby, the aspect ratio is ignored. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph divided on several pages without header and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut loading page gives you the option to set the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard drive, eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or ask the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The Open page gives you the option to set the behavior of a graph viewer; specify when a graph is opened outside a running session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a sub-window of the already running session) or determine that each time is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives you the possibility to set the start behavior of a viewer. you can set a default behavior (open the files of the last session or not) or decide to be asked for each start afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which usually appears at a click in the main window with the & RMBn, opens up further options:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can select among various & graphic; layout algorithms. the entries as described on the website of & graphviz are:</seg>
<seg id="750">Dot; algorithm, the standard for directional graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered representations of directed graphs. the algorithm puts the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for unexecuted graphs. it produces representations according to the springspring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is equivalent to statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a springboard model for ungerized graphs. it uses the Fruchterman-Reingold heuristics, and includes a multiple-latted trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The Circo; algorithm places the nodes in a circle according to the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command, which is then executed by a shell. the command should accept the graph file as a parameter, and display the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can specify & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms, or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graphene (directional or unerized) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type to (dot; for directional, & neato; for unerized graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview will be displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module provides you with tools to read and save new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scanning images: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that supports by the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. to make this work you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to pick the picture. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears by using the default values of ducts to select your image. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the button. the estimated file size will be shown in the right lower corner.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is completely displayed, as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the Scan button you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the destination picture appears. please remember that the type BMP does not compressed and therefore creates very large files. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create the image to save the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after you have selected in the Import &gt; Screen Photo menu. a window appears where you can set the different screenshots:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all of your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear, so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workstation. if you have picked up the complete Desktop, only the window will be read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screenshot is to wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other working areas, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been made, the dialog Options dialog appears with the options described above.</seg>
<seg id="784">The KIPI Modul Calendar currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI Team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note that the participants of this list speak English.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. Flickr makes it possible to send photos to the people that are important to you. you can show your favorite photos of the world that make photos of your camera mobile online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The module Export to Flickr can be used to upload pictures from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you will be guided through the process of generating a token. this will be used for your authentication. it is thus virtually your identification to Flickr. a browser is started so you can log in to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration the module can send photos to the Flickr website. you will find the following page after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you have pressed Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module starts exporting to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which displays the current permissions the module displays. to upload you need write permissions. the module currently does not support any other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The Add Photos button should be pressed once you have all the other options set. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you click on the Ok button, the upload of the photos to Flickr server starts.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Tags field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as keywords during upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the Public, Friends and Famillie options, you can set the permissions to your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you choose the option change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos will be changed before uploading in size. the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI Module Gallery export is a tool for exporting your picture collection to a gallery server</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI Module Gallery-Export currently has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI Team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note that the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. the geographic data are stored in the EXIF data of the image and the localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools for locating images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and width are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization correlations. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above-looking dialog will then appear. to load a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were recorded at the same time in the same places as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When loading the file an automatic correlation is performed that indicates the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera zone must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation indicates an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera distance. if the deviation is lower, the data will be merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have track data from a location for images, you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The interpolation and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the right data. if you know that in reality a location is in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. as the dialog displays the coordinates of one call to the next you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. to do so, select the region and magnify it. choose this again and again until you reach a sufficient accuracy. the altitude must always be manually selected. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exifttool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module Image Gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a gallery of HTML pages conforming to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab allows you to select all the albums you want to export to HTML. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenpreview and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. the option For each image a page creates a gallery in which each image will also get a separate page. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Dextershow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG image format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With Other color depth, you can change the default color depth. of course, this also affects file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnails will allow you to customize some of the settings from the Album tab for thumbnails, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during production. the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI Image Viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI Image Viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotation, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and folders. it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start a screen will be displayed in full screen mode. this can be changed to a windowed mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless Module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below without the usual losses of quality and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss-free storage is that it increases the file size because no compression of the color information takes place. for example, this can be found in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI Module digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI Team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note that the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the box-imaging @ kde.org mailinglist of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work for all image formats. you can copy it from anywhere, but not write in any target format. JPEG is supported in writing. please check idv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG encoder module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual images you can add a basic image transfer. you can also add an audio file to the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First, you need to select the images which are to be packed into the MPEG slide show. afterwards, you can create the module using Extras MPEG slide show.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change sorting of the pictures or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV Standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is pre-set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is defined below. a low value creates very sudden, a high, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should let them black. you can set the name and path of the file created by name of the MPEG output file. keep as the extension mpg as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you adjust all settings to your wishes, you can start the production of the movie using the encoding knob. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now go to a coffee quickly or in peace and enjoy the slideshow when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button Settings right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is, for example, useful to improve or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import and convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. a original quote from Him is: do not expect dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera creator. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file that is to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now re-adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings are to be used for white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all information on your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are planning to edit your images frequently or later use them elsewhere, you should not choose the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as memory format, the metadata that is contained in the raw file is stored in the JPEG File in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion by using the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. however, this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starring and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images from an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or enlarge the image.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportionally (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your image to the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Prepress: prepares the photo for the photo print. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target picture, including background size, edge size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the images window will be displayed with the images you have selected. you can add more images using the thumbnail image dialog. for the last selected image, a preview will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the picture list to add the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">Removing the images from the list of images to be sent will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the button OK. you just have to add the addresses and the subject here. the pictures you selected are already attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Most e-mail accounts have limitations to the size of sending e-mails. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration will be saved and re-used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your email client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and added to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to the loss-free formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original copies are added to the images you send.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages, looking for errors. however, your e-mail program will be automatically started at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced slideshow, a window with questions about how to display your slideshow will appear. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-transitions option in the presentation mode activates very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option file name indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The Loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a loop. afterwards, you can cancel it manually with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not the order of the images used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the images the temporal distance between the images can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select. randomly choose another effect between images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI Team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note that the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set an image as a background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as a background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have completed your images and videos with annotations, you can start with & kphotoalbum; by these browse, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, there are now entries in each group, thus in persons, places and in the group keyword entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories you entered when you have entered your images and videos with annotations. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images. in the following, each one is described.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images are displayed on which both persons are to be seen. by this selection method you can restrict the number of displayed images from a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, places and other settings, you can view the images in your field using thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the image, each person has the same symbol before their name. you can use & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own preview image, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display the view for each category separately (if you do not have suitable images for your search words).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must select which image for each individual person should be displayed. to do this, you need to select the image editor window (described in more detail) and select the image for the respective person in the context menu. here you can select the image for the respective person. in the View window, you can customize the magnification factor according to your wishes and by selecting which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you view the search in the main window, a dialog will show you that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog again on the image.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the labeling or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images will be searched after this text. if you would like, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here, according to images, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try the same functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the Homepage of & kPhotoAlbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog select the demo if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; demo. then some sample images are loaded and you can try the features of & kphotoalbum; try it.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the Homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can preview the displayed items preview from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview pane) and in addition, the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in preview viewing.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of timeline by holding down the mouse button and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the timeline. if you select a area, you will preview only images of this time period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you with two options to create HTML pages with your images. one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum; integrated version that you can create through the menu File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and destination. in the following, each section is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the title and a description that will contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file should be created on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed that is obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, that all images are from a party. note that & kphotoalbum; currently all images are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from particular viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unambiguous, which is why they are not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images. this allows those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download any pictures, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site may change the resolution at any time you have set. so it can search your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transmission time. if you want to get a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you have to select the root folder where all of your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time. this allows you to select either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if these are really all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will be started after the pages have been created. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them to it. so that the import function, see, works correctly, you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described above have all three based on base folders respectively URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you might want to create your images with these. however, if you have already spent quite a lot of time for viewing the image information, persons on the pictures, recording location, etc. then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work will not do again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others to your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external ones. they differ in whether the images are stored in the file itself or whether the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you have all the images together and that you can share this file independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the File Export menu... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be scanned. this is of course only possible if you created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following describes the dialog for exporting images that you can access through the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it is to be internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available:</seg>
<seg id="938">In the manual to copy Manually to the .kim file, you have to copy the images into the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With option Automatically copy to copy the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are regular zip files. as most of the images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not recommended to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each picture should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Import menu... select & kphotoalbum; import the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard to import consists of four steps. first you have to select which images you want to import, then in which folder the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category is called in your database, so you will be asked in the third dialog box which categories of the file to be imported and what categories they correspond to in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. for example, see the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at images, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will go through the different steps of (1) determining the information about your images, through (2) browsing and watching, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures, but it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but frequently this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; saves all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of its images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. normal backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remembers the folder where your images are stored and will automatically reuse it in future starts. if you want to read another database in & kPhotoAlbum; if you want to start another folder tree with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; with option -c. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... you can move to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual you will explain the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different icons, with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call by pressing a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each picture, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog that is used to edit existing groups. for each group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section, subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up complete members groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group, instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list box above you can select the category you want to configure. in the left part of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; share its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called from the Module menu. the modules can and will not be described in this manual, because they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by multiple applications together, it may be that the modules were tested with & kphotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should first test new modules first with the demo database before you use them on your own pictures Application &gt; kphotoalbum demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or through the Help menu. don't say I wouldn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use over KIPI together are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum do not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications arrange their images in albums: an album is simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order is not supported, it simulates for some modules the order by albums, so that you can use the features with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all the pictures that show you the preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album & kphotoalbum; the modules also have to pass a list of albums. here goes & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you have defined in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category Persons, & kphotoalbum; so do so, so if you have selected people to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog and select the modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">Under the toolbar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database. currently, it does not contain very much information, as you do not have any information about your images. in the section we will return to this window, now click on the entry to show you an overview of all the existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see any picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons who are shown on the image, where the image has been taken, etc. you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time. if, for example, on all pictures Jesper is pictured and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments by using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text box by specifying persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; because you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 images the same 5-10 people can be moved, so that the names used are moved upwards, the persons can find and arrange them faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to see an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sort by date on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each picture individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with comments. in this case simply click on the above and back buttons that are located under the preview of the picture on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have received multiple images, e.g. with the same person, it may be more convenient to mark all those pictures and use the menu item Several entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as an overboard. to show you that it is a sub-group, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the comment dialog context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory or subcategory. additionally, you can simply drag an entry to a category and drop it to make it a subcategory of this entry. caution, this presupposes that you are sorting your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that creates the upper edge of the frame. you can also make a custom window from a frame by dragging it outside of the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the look of the window so to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options button... which gives you among other things the possibility to save the current setup and look of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to view this window later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide windows here. you can see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the images in the browser, you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images, or all images if you do not have a filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of the thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will appear in the image viewer. if you don't yet open a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Delete from the Edit menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; namely, use pictures without having you stored on the hard disk. of course you have to have the images stored somewhere, thus & kphotoalbum; you can view the view from & kphotoalbum; if not all necessary pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images where the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard disk. however, the thumbnails are present for the images 5-9, so that & kphotoalbum; you can preview these images. however, you can't view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this feature requires you to copy files from folders and copy them back. if so, please do not support them to insert the CD in question. if so, please buy a larger hard drive to save all images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the pictures menu you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures in such a way that at the end those remaining, which you want to make for others, and click on Current View in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also select all the images that your little sister may see and lock the menu entry All but up-to-date view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to specify which images are to be hidden in case of the case. if you now give your laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry to open images, so that all the images you have locked is hidden. if you want to view the pictures again, click on the lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please note that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all images on the hard disk and on the other, anyone who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who have with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to forbid the view on private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you want to describe all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason, & kphotoalbum; about an image _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. of course, it shows the image, but additional all the information you have entered through the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If you want to see the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and place somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is to be displayed at all. all of these options are available after a right click on the viewer. the then appearing context menu can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the info box are underlined. if you click here, the browser will display matching entries to this. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the images of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the picture above and below. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and End. these functions are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; it is possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you are using the viewer you can simply drag a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus key you can zoom in with the mouse. with the minus key you can zoom out the Plus button zoomed in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the outcome of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the equation button sets the zoom, so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zooming operations that work in videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key are.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the Script functions from the context menu you can rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can make comments on the current image using the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you view images it may happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture. at the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names. however, you may prefer to select only the image and look at more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to have pictures with features while you look at them. features are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in this picture you will see a picture where the characters A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, these are available in your browser. so if you want to view all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, just provide all of them once with annotations. this is described in. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and especially features can be displayed in preview view. if you can view categories in the preview screen, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image has been selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you will be allowed to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database. on the way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to close the painting mode from & kphotoalbum; select on the image from the context menu. to finish the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler, you have to use the program & Povray; not fully control, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an object already selected, as all subproperties are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the location where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar, or select a menu item in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu is displayed to enable you to choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With Delete either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove previously selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to Apply these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message with an error description will be displayed. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply and Cancel the Changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to the & Povray; user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">By default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross it locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a shelf level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the default window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as you like. you can also save multiple window orders and easily switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, draw the beginning water to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle will then display the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the user to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, select the beginning agent in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the map tab at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from anchoring, drag the beginning water to the desktop or click on the small left pointing arrow in the beginning bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the beginning bar. to prevent closing, click the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views in the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for any type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any location.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with view window order... Save. there will be a dialog where you can save the window order from an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them render. & kpovmodeler; uses & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program has to be installed properly. as this manual is written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on Rendering the Rendering icon in the toolbar, or select the View Scene menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode meets the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select Render modes in the View menu... the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the box size, you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small part of the image, select the check box section and enter the image section to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality you can select the properties, the & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User Manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with just one ray per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, images with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling refers to the neighbouring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because every pixel is split again and again because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixels exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are tracked individually and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you switch on Jittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for rendering quality is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays don't hit any object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select Import Menu Add File... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supported & kpovmodeler; not yet the complete command scope of & Povray; when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog box shows a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can paste source code for & Povray; also.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; renders a scene. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the help in the property view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your document and the version. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example height data) in paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the scene folder, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the viewing field in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object-catch of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the sphere, you can set the level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you tick the high level of detail for extended projections, all wire-model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this property results in a better approach for projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you tick wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is represented in a chessboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the bottom, a bottom is rendered underneath the objects. the floor is represented in a chessboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used to render the scenes. you can adjust the depth and threshold values. you can find more detailed information about the parameters in the Render modes section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders. in the Window Assets section you will learn how to create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The standard window arrangement: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of window orders present shows all existing window orders. you can create a new arrangement using the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the selected window order. new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">With New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with map card you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs. if you follow all the steps in this tutorial, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball at one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings, before you complain that you will receive only a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything correctly, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following preset window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you will get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">To follow this guide you first have to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit menu item Edit. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire-model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you can see the contents of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray, you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in the view has control points that you can change the target point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the Apply or Enter key, the wire-model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the perspective of the camera here.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could, for example, insert a box (inserting Infinite Body Quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply or the Enter key. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model view now also displays the plane, albeit at the moment only as a limited endpoint. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you view the object tree accurately, you will find that you can fold the entry for the bottom by clicking on the + in front of the object. in this case, you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options and change the possible settings in the object properties pane.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. select shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the bottom to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens, in which you can select how the object should be inserted. please select first subtitle. the pigment is then displayed in the property tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigmentation), with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment only shows a matte black material, because you still have to enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the box and the ball in the preview, click the Apply button and then click the Preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. here are some more settings necessary. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called one color. then edit this entry twice (you can do this even more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select monochrome each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to execute this step, as you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the sphere is just as easy to create as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the input button or the Apply button), so the ball has contact with the floor. otherwise the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the ground around one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the rendering now results in a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the following step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the ground, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first object and change the name for example in ball Pigment. click on ball Pigment, then select colors and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the Enter key.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness effect and reflection result already result in good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler has; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracytracing is a Render Method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracen a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical beams from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that render the scenes) by every pixel in the scene. the render will calculate the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect. thus the scene pixel is processed for pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you will also see nothing, the picture is simply black. obviously, any scene that is to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog you can select a file you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the recently restored command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Backstage.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the appearance, keyboard shortcuts, and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcuts. you can change or add new commands for & kpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog for setting up the toolbar. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump Map is a way to pretend rough surfaces without having to model each diffraction on the surface without altering the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a Bump Map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying a picture file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kudexshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kudexshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can display by clicking the & LMBs; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether any image should be displayed in your own window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, just type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching file name has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In three of them, General and editing and slide show, you can set the operation of & kudexshow; in the other two, short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser, the keyboard shortcuts can be specified for the respective window.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">If this point activates, charges & kudexshow; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current image. this reduces the delay if you select the next image and is particularly suitable for a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option saves & kudexshow; when closing the name of the last opened folder. at the next start opens & kudexshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click the colored bar to select a background color. this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if the window is larger than the image in the window mode, the background is filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can configure & cuddle show; set up only some of the file types that can also display the program.</seg>
<seg id="1140">This option increases the display window to the full screen for large images. this option is enabled as default.</seg>
<seg id="1141">Specifies whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image.</seg>
<seg id="1142">To change the value, you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field. the default is 3 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1143">If this value is set to 0, the slide show will be repeated until it is aborted by the user. to change the value, you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field. the default is 1.</seg>
<seg id="1144">Change the keyboard shortcuts for the various operating modes of & kudexshow; in the flashcards short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser.</seg>
<seg id="1145">This option allows you to switch between the two-part view of the file system (a window for the subfolders and a window for the files) and the one-part view of the file system with folders and files in one window.</seg>
<seg id="1146">Displays large icons for the files in the folder. this display is only possible in the short description.</seg>
<seg id="1147">Displays small icons for the files in the folder. this display is only possible in the short description.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general features, most of which can also be found in other KDE programs. this section is comprised of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context-browser, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripts. a sample call for the DCOP function break may look like:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports Qt and & kde command line options; in addition, Amarok has some command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are available and use kdialogue so that the user knows why a script does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Corundum' Rescue error error = 'Corundum' (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script. '' kdialogue --sorry '# {error}' 'exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates directory, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow external programs and commands to be executed. usually the function exec () is used. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends alerts to all running scripts. for this reason, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure switches the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signals that a new play is alluded. the script could now ask for more information about the new piece using DCOP functions (for example, the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustommenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a custom menu entry is clicked. to add an entry to the menu, you can use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (Submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the Signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to perform e.g. clearing operations. this includes saving data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user and zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.bz2), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the extension amarokscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can download it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page from & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist rather than having to work through endless menus. maybe you just look for a certain title from thousands in your collection. mit & Amarok; 's Collection Browser and quick search will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Perhaps you already have some playlists, but can never decide which you want to hear? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you. and if the decision is still hard to decide, the dynamic mode and smart playlists automatically choose the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music. this and many more useful features make Amarok the most advanced audio player. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right thing to rediscover your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Typically, in the basic folder of the Amarok sources you have to enter the following to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automake are used if you don't have any trouble during compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them to the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options you can enable or disable at compile time using the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compiler options, certain dependencies must be met so that they can be used. for details, see the System Requirements section.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Activates debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help in developing & Amarok; if you want to help, you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& Amarok; lets you set up the setup dialog without any effort. the setup dialog has several flashcards to set up the various functions of Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">In addition, if the option is disabled, only the playlist window will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Use barometer: this function is only available if & Amarok; with support for moodbar compiled. the option switches the experimental function of the tuning barometer.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Atmospheric design: this function is only available if & Amarok; with support for moodbar compiled. this will change the color scheme used for the tuning barometer.</seg>
<seg id="1213">When this setting is enabled, .mood files are stored at the location of the respective music files. otherwise the .mood files are stored in the settings folder of & Amarok; stored (normally ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / moodable /).</seg>
<seg id="1214">External Browser: lets you choose which browser to run from & Amarok; when a browser is required.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Use other browsers: specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">When you save the playlist, the current playlist will automatically save when ending & Amarok; enable this option if you don't want to lose the current playlist while you exit.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: when you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, use. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keep up-to-date play when changing the piece causes the playlist to pop up / off to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing the context browser, it automatically displays the context-browser as soon as the next piece is alluded.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the look section you can customize the look & Amarok; the section is subdivided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; by selecting own fonts, the otherwise gray shown section is activated. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist window, player window and context-browser. click Select... so you can select a font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the Selection Custom color scheme, you have the choice of choice and can define your own color scheme. use the selected color selection for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Resume playback when starting, and Amarok; after program start, resume playback automatically with the piece, with which it has been stopped at the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Setting up the on-screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. when using on-screen display, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings directly in this preview.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box Shadow causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Use your own colors gives you the possibility to customize the OSD color for font and background. a click on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection. if own colors are not activated, the default colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering placeholders, the OSD can be adjusted to your own needs. below is a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The option screen is intended for Xinerama users. this allows you to specify which screen of a multi-monitor environment the OSD should appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The audio card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down selector. some drivers still activate more settings in this card card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and the type of the database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, the & Amarok; browse to music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also includes check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok; both the selected and their subfolders will be searched for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: allows & Amarok; to monitor the selected folders to changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). additionally, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import Playlists: causes & Amarok to add all found playlists to your collection folders (.pls- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will then appear in the playlist browser later.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the drop down selector driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup is necessary in the MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql setup section is used to set up the database for & Amarok; on computer: enter the computer on which the MySql database is located. then, under port: the network port is entered under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use username: password: to enter the data required for connection to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The load .fm card directs the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and if necessary create music recommendations regarding the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you do not have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send off played pieces and thus update the profile: this setting allows you to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Retrieve similar performers: after activating this setting, & Amarok; a list of similar interpreters will be retrieved to the played piece. you can view the list in context-browser. note: you do not need a last.fm profile to use this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the kdelibs package and no other KDE packages. so you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide on how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD presuppose that your window manager considers the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, but fluxbox will work for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the TagLib developers under bugs.kde.org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash. after that you can delete the file and create the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">It is mostly because taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developers under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all libraries used by & Amarok; used libraries with the same compiler version have been compiled. if, for example, & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib was compiled with GCC 3.3.X, then this leads to crashes when editing meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then deactivate autom. disable if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens with a crash). if it is a common crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the Meta-Infos, but do not mark it as Unicode. the following perl script resolves the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "File $ARGV [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: mplib &gt; new ($ARGV [0]); my $v2tag = $mp3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>
<seg id="1253">This script needs the Perl module MP3:: Mplib. it can be reinstalled with this command: Perl -MCPAN -e 'install MP3:: Mplib'</seg>
<seg id="1254">In KDE 3.4.0, the symbols in the status bar (random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist) are always active. this is a known bug in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the symbol effects are easily forgotten. note that in some cases, one has to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: amarokapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setpixel ERK7Qpixmap, please check if Amarok is using the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd 'which amarokapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or modify / etc / ld.so.conf to find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some ways. most installation problems are most easily clarified by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in the channel # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable to search for help. please only make a mistake there if you find something about fixing a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only an empty playlist appears. how do music come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitive, the Start subwindow has been converted to the Statistics window. you will find it under Extras Statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To rate pieces, the list column must be displayed in the playlist. click on the title bar of the playlist and select column Show rating. click anywhere in the new rating column to specify the rating for a piece. you can also use the short instructions Windows + [1-5]. this also works when Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard. or right click on your selection and then select Remove From playlist from the drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Drag a playlist file to the playlist with the mouse and drop it down there, just as you would do with other files too.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In the toolbar of the playlist, right next to the Add button, the button will be saved. click on it.</seg>

<seg id="1269">None! yes, that really is true! no! & Amarok; uses a backend independent approach, so the real question must be: what media types supports GStreamer / xine / Arts / NMM / MAS / KDEmm?. as you can see, we support pretty much any imaginable audio format. GStreamer can even decode text and PNG!</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a mixer. a mixer enables several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixers (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you search for the problem cause and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify a different sink (e.g. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">You can't simply send an MP3 to ALSA, you would only listen to a white noise. GStreamer is for most people the best choice if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decode it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. exactly like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can print directly to ALSA, as well as xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer drivers (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open Control Center Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable Soundserver with highest priority (real time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure the artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDEMultimedia Codecs that can cause disturbed play. read this error report. enlarge the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either you do not use the Arts driver but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Use another driver (the xine driver was strongly optimized for analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system. the smaller the buffer, the less dregs react the visualizations. yes, this is a mistake, please help us fix it.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but when I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, crashes and Amarok; why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you must register all of the components. register to register all of the GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help you can also ask for the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (quit Amarok before!): - Download ffmpeg, compile and install it. then perform log registers, once as a system administrator and once as your normal user. then delete all the mpeg files in the GStreamer module folder (you will find the module folder with the path-config / GStreamer-config) and execute it again. start now & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, the navigation pane is on the left. in the navigation pane, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context-browser.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context-browser displays various information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be customized with the help of context-browser designs. the context-browser contains three sub-windows: music, text and artist. these three sub-windows will be explained later in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you already have earlier versions of & Amarok; used, you may notice that the subwindow has dropped off. the information presented there are now in other parts of & Amarok; also, the information can be viewed in the Statistics window (Extras Statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music window displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>

<seg id="1348">Below the Musicbrainz icon you will find more information about the current piece. you can see here how often and when the piece has been played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">The images can have arbitrary names but images with the word front in the name are preferred. the context-browser will also show cover images that were either downloaded with the Cover Administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next area, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>

<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be worked out and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if not yet a text script is running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Group Artist - grouped only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist and there will be a further distribution according to the respective album. if you want to see compilations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Group Artist / Year - Album - Sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the latest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - Albumname is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically by each other. the artist is ignored.</seg>

<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically re-capture your collection once you have something on the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly under the toolbar, there is a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes for using this filter can be found in the section about the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a selection box with which help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can also select different time windows, starting from the last 24 hours to a year.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will get the following options.</seg>

<seg id="1378">Pick up the compilation flag - Changes a record selected as a compilation back into a normal album. after that, the album will no longer be displayed with different interpreters but again under the associated interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlist browser makes it easy to deal with many playlists. among other things, it also includes Smart Playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. this use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for running time. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>

<seg id="1385">The tool bar is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a entered URL. for example, enter / home / mike / musik.tar.gz and press Enter key, you can access music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping the Shift key. in that case, holding down the Shift key may be helpful: this will automatically insert random files at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired position. as soon as you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. in order to reset the filter, press the return button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">When typing blanks separate search terms, & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter one two three, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">When you enter OR between the search terms, search for entries containing either one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination of it).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, then close the search term with Griffon footprints: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries found by Mike Oldfield, but not for entries like Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you may also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a certain search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations at will. example: Mike Oldfield OR Score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this is looking for all the pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not have the comment bad.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key and then click on the entries with the right mouse button. the entries will then receive a marking with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some features of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1462">When you view this entry, you can select files to add to the project through the appearing dialog. this has the same effect as if you enter the files directly from the top view in the project view. if the current project is a data CD, the added files appear in the base folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Opens the dialog "Burn" to the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the project's properties dialog. the only difference is the additional button burning, the & k3b; to burn the medium. the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make a lot of project related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described by the What is this? help described (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry only appears in an active data CD / DVD or video-DVD project. it causes & k3b to import files from a previous session into the current project. this is useful if you do not use files for a multi-session CD. the data from the previous session will always be included even if this function is not used. it is designed for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders already present on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This function causes & k3b; to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project. this function does not remove any files from the medium, it only blends the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">This allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can only create a copy of a CD which you can then burn later on. also, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copy. you should prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">This also allows you to create a copy of a DVD, which you can then burn later on. also, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copy. also, the target medium must be large enough to record the entire (video) data of the source medium in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW. this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog to format a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD + R (W) so the content is completely deleted. & k3b; lets you choose between the write modes overwrite and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">The dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported yet, but you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burning a previously created DVD image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">This dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table of contents, but can also be used alone. it contains information about the read video, encoding settings and even options for changing size and trimming black borders.</seg>
<seg id="1474">This information is displayed in the table of contents and contains features of the medium, such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Displays a list of toolbar icons of & k3b; if an entry is checked, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">When this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, their content is displayed in the table of contents. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locks and unlock the drive or ejection of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The table of contents enables the selection and pulling of files into the project view. the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs, provided a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The headline is a narrower area that is only visible if the project view contains open projects. the headline has no real function, it only looks nice and separates the project view from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for & k3b. after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the keyboard layout further below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; Setup Wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs. for this you need to set up system administrator rights, so you have to enter the password for the system administrator (root) when you start the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be done. almost all functions of & k3b; should work immediately. this dialog is intended for personalization and fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; -applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. using this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the DCOP; functions, you can either use the command line dcop, or the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and the type of your task will be decisive, which of the accompanying programs will give you a default.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume you are using the dcop command line program. to be able to use the command line program dcop, you must first make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions common to all & kde; -program common, supported & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface from & k3b; provides functions like copyCD, format DVD and other features for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Void copy.dvd () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () void formatted () void burnCdImage () void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project via the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then get a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject. using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name) void createFolder (Qstring name, Qstring parent) void addUrls (KURL:: list of urls, QString Selection) void renameItem (Qstring path, QString NewName) void set VolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createData CDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; it is easy to read audio CD; s can be read and stored in mp3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder which is installed on the machine.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and by many encoders that encode these WAV files (compress). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are currently supported (these encoding packages must be added to the program (if installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read out and stored in wav files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per caption) are compressed in the MP3 or OGG format or other formats such as the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step you need to have lame (for MP3), oggogbis (for OGG) or other encoders. all of these programs are generally available for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything yourself. however, only the Kodierer packages must be installed that are needed. if, for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction to encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to bypass any copy protection. if not the firmware of the CD; / DVD device does not handle protection, it is not possible to bypass any protected audio CD; even do not bypass the mechanisms of copy protection. just avoid buying copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found), the daily use of reading a & CD; explained on the hard disk. this leads (hopefully) to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface that you will stumble across in the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert to many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, whereby everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. on the step by step example, you will find more information on how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The CDDB requests the CD data according to the set-up of inquiry on the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if a encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup Guide - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available encoders so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the default. it must be noted that previously the encoder in the encoding settings tab was configured in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a complete & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages (such as protocols, pipses) for program events (such as reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog from & kaudiocreator; with different card cards (such as encoder, for setting up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coding and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Under the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit rates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate, the differences are less important as both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame is nevertheless supplied with most distributions free of charge, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (at high bit rates), but compared with OGG slightly lower quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playing equipment is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto-stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression ratio approx. 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression ratio about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music from youths, portable devices and car ostereos. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have absolutely the highest quality regardless of the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The CD; information that is manually entered or fetched through the program automatically from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; add titles to the keywords (english: tag) when encoded MP3s with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs, so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer. it is to be noted that this is only spoken by text: & CD; Title, Artist, Names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (editor's note) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information that is public on the CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (bogged) address than the one in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only be the programmer knowing the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator is set up for the use of freedb, the nearest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more about it, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. please note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this hasn't happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the selected wav files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) are on the tab to set the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoding package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for pre-defined encoders. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD disk, read and write true on it and if both cdparanoia and audio-encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give you tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still uncertain what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will launch the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 shouts (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You need to have cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine since it is considered to be not totally free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permissions on it (eg by trying to copy something into the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; something that is probably only done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each CD & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoders to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to change it every time you read a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name will be transferred to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, the effective device name can also be specified. if the drive can be accessed with other programs, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device designations for the CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">Here there is not much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is left to be left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Just select with incomplete information, so that you will be informed when information is missing for generating key words (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is simple, becomes a & CD; entry found, immediately begins reading the & CD;. this is associated with low risk if you are later unsatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can be easily changed. the directory or file name will be changed with Konqueror &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, please note: if you want to enter all manually, deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. however, you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to download the database first. however, this is more than 620 MB big, you need to choose between the two selection fields, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data query, for calling the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb. put everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB servers: please go to the freedb.org page and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed among the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as far as the server is concerned, as many firewalls are blocking the protocol 8880 by default, there might be more luck with the protocol 80 because the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to transfer data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screen shot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, therefore simply try himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard after reading the last piece: check this to the CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must the path / folder where the wav files are stored. this can be useful if there is only space on another drive. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wav files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter it as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something has to be flattened to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as already mentioned before, this is an attitude of very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & kde; in case of subsequent change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded wav files: at a Dualcore or Quad-core or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is, we just have the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; finished. this configuration is used as standard for any reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was described in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is structured, since we are comfortable and the & CD; the process of which is described in this section, must be repeated for each erasing & CD; repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use one & CD; use which is not yet in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from the data collected by freedb. therefore, you will learn the & CD; enter data manually instead of removing them from the internet. comments will indicate the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' output of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not happened yet, then the & CD has to be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screenshot. this only if the CD; can be identified as audio CD; can be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, look for help in the Questions and Answers section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD; successfully obtained from the freedb, all titles are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; there will be a window, and you can select the database entry in your opinion best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in dialog for settings), you can also manually trigger by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need to connect to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD-Editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the sample on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field 'Current Title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for individual comments individual each piece, the commentary field of the album is used for comments that are common for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successful retrieval of the data from the freedb, the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words with capital letters start or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece, and on only 28 characters for the comment section. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least to what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set on the encoding settings tab; see the section 'Core Settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the CD; in this example this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap, for example, can be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "after choosing" "" "OK" "" "you get back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second part." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece. only the tracks that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece to or off. make sure all pieces are selected, or press the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If the selection process is selected by clicking on the selection process, this window will appear for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the entries and track down what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on tab orders to switch to the order window. it is located in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message tells you if you try to work with a code that you have not yet installed. pieces that were not successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>

<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: assignment # 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into MP3 format. this allows reading and encoding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has found no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. the result is unclear. the computer used with an AMD64 seems to have no problem at the simultaneous reading and encoding (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message for a short time is displayed in the upper left part of the window.</seg>

<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help, how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings. best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshots of the different map maps of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading? even if only the Help menu was clicked after the initial startup of the program without any clue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it about? who reads this, probably already started the program. it should look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; whoever wants to add or modify something useful, may do it. and if you read this, he has left this section and is therefore in agreement with this proposal.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaokespieler von & kde; beside others, it has a real-time graphics and karaoke real-time collection of texts also some features that others & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS - and & kde; support also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver needed for GUS cards. Alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color so that it is easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag and drop so that you can drag in & kde; any MIDI file from one & konqueror; window to mid-mid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files (properties or text events). kmid automatically determines the process used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. when you end a song while playing a song, kmid starts again with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from one & konqueror; window into the & kmid; window will drop. this works also with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the Play from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece will automatically start once you drag it to the & kmid; (several pieces will be added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid; a piece is played, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and driving with the controller.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly, you can click on the arrows left and right of the template and thus change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar looks like a print on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item, thus interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be saved in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and others do both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set which events should be displayed and even better: the type of event is automatically determined, which a song is used, so that you do not need to manually set the entry automatic text selection. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select text events or properties from the Settings menu. the same function also has keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that summarize you. these are played by the series. in this section, you can use how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the Collections menu under the point Organize.... Click there on New and specify the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specifying the name for the new collection.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the winnings in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection is not saved. remember that when you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song by button Add. it appears in turn the file dialog with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to Collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically add to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs will be played. when you select the series from the menu sequence of the Collections menu, the songs will be played in the order that they have been added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song button, the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button Previous piece, the item Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete, and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter as it is not saved when leaving from & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI map translates General MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to Bright Piano type into events of the type Change patch to Trumpet, thus getting a trumpet sound when playing a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps, so you need to edit the corresponding file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all required conversions for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the Keymap section which may appear as often as desired. but the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap 'Name of Keymap'... END Define Keymap 'Another Keymap'... END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is used to indicate that a section starts (except OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email so that I can in future versions of & kmid; support can offer for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section describes how the patches of General MIDI can be mapped to your specific keyboard. the general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you must not change the order, nor leave any row for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">For example, if your keyboard does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which sounds similar to a gun. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the note 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that the term drum patch refers to a different percussionist (drum, pelvis, Maracas & etc;), and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to indicate how sound is displayed on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, as well as its presence. so you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keywords for each channel and instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map tones to the percussion channel. see for example the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, please do so in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped onto the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap will be used with the name Name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will change the patch on that channel. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio specifies where pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a Pitch Bender event with the value n, it will be converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM indicates that a pitch is supposed to play a pitch with the value 4096, a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two sounds up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you can find it in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the knob does not light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the played tones. select View from the Settings menu under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed played by a song. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, etc. so that the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you have to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">OK, therefore support & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder that you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">By default, enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have an & conqueror; window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when playing a MIDI file) or attached (if I play a Karaoke file), only in the & konqueror; window change and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection, turn the Automatic Add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.D.M., B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so, set automatic addition to the collection and open A.mid. Your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! when I hear these songs or see the postcard, I encourage me to further program and program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; MÃ ¡laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; MÃ ¡laga. at the moment I am in the third year, so I do not have much spare time for my hobbies but I try to collect MIDI files, make music and prove sentences.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me feel happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">If you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MIDI- / Karaoke file from a local group, I will be among friends of & kmid; list (if you want to). before sending a MIDI file, you should contact me, as I may have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and no one gets money for it. I would like to stress that I only want to further programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">Thanks also to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Peter Gritsch, Magnus Pfeffer, Urko Lusa, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error notification or even a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, & kmid can also be found on his homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, look for information and view images. you will also find links to sites with additional karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a soundcard, you must compile & kmid; compile with the MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL parameter. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can't hear any music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and FFMPEG. the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by MPlayer or Phonon, as well as playback of DVD's, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called docking windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save preferred links under the Bookmark menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played one by one, then you should use the category Permanent Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level. if you click on an entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the associated entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not running. the various files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / directory can be edited by an editor, but also by the application itself.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select the same playlist from the menu and select either the Edit Mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without having to match the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during startup and ending can be deactivated by editing ~ / .kde / share / kmplaywc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to enable a different animation. & KMPlayer; will be aware of the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup needs not to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be disturbing during the end animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the display of a favorite photo: & lt; & lt; & lt; mimic; & lt; img dur = "inhibited" src = "file: / / / home / koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet" / notes; / smiled; In the source package of & KMPlayer; are supported in the test / some examples of SMIL which are supported by & KMPlayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog from & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the 'Console' button in the toolbar of KMPlayers. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog from & KMPlayer; All needs to be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, such as setting up the backend via mimetype. here is an example of how to play a 'flash' using the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">"" "" "" "Flash" "" "can be played within & KMPlayer; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML." ""</seg>
<seg id="1724">To enable the & KMPlayer; 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module must be specified as a service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is used in a console application and searched for error messages regarding loading the browser module library. the started process is called crap player. if no errors occur here, the backend issue is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">In order to always have a predefined backend for a specific mime type (of course only if this has been determined), it must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should reflect all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can be played by TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in Settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo port should be used. there, ports should be detected, of which one is selected. the encoding must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the video forlinux extension for the X server must be functional. for the XFree86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, various names are used by KMPlayer for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, this is dvdnaval, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrSource. if enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there any hints on how to quieter my CDROM drive when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command HDPARM -E 8 / dev / cdrom is to be executed as root user after the device is plugged into. it is absolutely certain that / dev / cdrom is on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine only starts up slowly, why does each time my CPU be tested for performance?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is overtaking. kxineplayer automatically needs the last saved value, only the first time xine will check the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1742">Latex;: a professional typesetting application. under Unix-like systems it is likely to be used on the packet & texlive; or & tetex; (for older systems).</seg>
<seg id="1743">Most of these components may be included in the Linux / Linux distribution. the installation should include the documentation of the distribution or installation CD; / DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1744">The & kile; project includes some already compiled packages from & Kile; for different distributions. these allow easy installation without further compiling and are included on the box; -website.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with & latex;, & kde;, & kile; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users hardly need to read this manual. however, all suggestions for documentation are taken into account. if the support for this project or its documentation is desired, the contact via the box should be made.</seg>
<seg id="1747">If you have any questions or if you want to compile and / or add extensions, please refer to the Kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1748">& Kile; is an integrated & latex; -Environment for the & kde; desktop. & kile; offers the possibility to use all & latex; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple, immediate and customized access to all & latex; programs. furthermore, the easy to use wizard, the & latex; -Reference and the powerful project management.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about & Kate; and to learn its possibilities the handbook should be consulted to Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly by reading the chapter Working with the Editor of & Kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For latex; is the right pronunciation: Lay-TECH. while the original & tex is; difficult to use, can also use a layman (inlay) & latex; -macros. a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it derives from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While here is only a good overview of & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book to do so. to master natural latex; good books for example H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The introduction contains at least the command\\ documentclass, the body starts with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed again with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick Start Wizard of & Kile; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in & Kile; the selection of the wizard (MenÃ ¼) provides some possibilities for creating the document. you can also make some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this describes the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], letter [letter], report [report], article (DIN) [scrartcl], report (DIN) [scrlog], projector [beamer], foils [Prosper] or user defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: the encoding of the system is set. modern systems are increasingly using the UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best, UTF-8X should be used (for correct processing of the & latex).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used additional packages for latex; for inclusion, they can only be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), report (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users now don't have to worry about it. it is simply a brief description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; offers - just like other source editors - the highlighting of the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). by & Kile; If you see larger areas of a green text on the screen, it is very likely that some mathematical environment is not closed. however, it will be spared by the modest appearance of the output file. however, it will save you time and time.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With the automatic completion of the surroundings, a new command (e.g.\\ end {command}) is created by & Kile; the command generates a blank line (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be disabled in the box settings... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the highest and the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by one click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful. as soon as a DVI is created, file can be very helpful. as soon as a DVI, file [specified D e V ice I ndepFile]] was created, jumps & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI; viewer to the corresponding line in the & latex; -source.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the commercial output of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the check box, the elements of the DVI, file with the editor, and as soon as an element in the DVI; file has been clicked, becomes the corresponding section in the & latex; source search is the exact opposite of it.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master Document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, the work is simplified with other .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set about project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick mounting: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">Video surveillance: in this mode, the DVI-file is called, and there is no call from & Okular; after the quick installation.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit toolbar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for quick inclusion of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for the quick link of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; -Commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The further drop-down selector is available for items such as keywords, footnotes or references. the available options include:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a name for a section, an image or a different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified name (selection over a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote a drop-down list is displayed with literary entries. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. for editing & bibtex; files are necessary editors. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down selector with the name GrÃ ¶ e.e is used for the specification of the font size. you can define the fonts for the main text, the base notes, etc. there are the following types of fonts available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font size. if the font size is not set at the beginning, this can also happen later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has been entered, the & latex has to be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the menu building or the button quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compilation of the document fails, it should be sought after the errors. if this is not the case, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be followed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (engl environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns are supposed to have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will then allow the change of characters within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are supervised only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold pressure, passive pressure, subdivisions, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is valid for italics and is valid until it is closed with a\ end {emph} or another environment.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quota: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text with the & latex; -markup language was presented, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be performed. to do this, mind. a quote, a few places in the grease and passive pressure and a poem are used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, editor view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer). the window must be closed with an external viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI, file has been created, the document can be printed or converted to an & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (English D e V ice I ndep.). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI, the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can then be printed by file (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI to other formats. once the DVI, file from the & latex; source code has been created, the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pretext search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; binaries. for this purpose, just setting up Modern under Settings Kile... Tools can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To perform the pre-search query, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source text and then be clicked on while searching. the jump to the corresponding location in DVI; the viewer then follows.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI; - Document the corresponding & latex; - Document from & Kile; open and jump to the corresponding line.</seg>
<seg id="1796">If the use of Quick Configuration does not open, a fault can be present. if an error is present, it will be displayed in the logging file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file will detect the source of errors in the source text. in the editor, the buttons of the previous LaTeX errors and NÃ ¤nester LaTeX errors can be used between the errors. the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears. to view the faulty line, the error in the logging must be clicked and & kile; jump to the erroneous line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">When clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window to select the template to be used appears for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can either be written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1800">High-quality users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents. templates can be created in & boxes; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file can be opened or created a new file. & Kile; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting file template from document... Create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template by file New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings Box... Settings can be set in General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are substituted by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering the document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created this way, the following steps must be completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files. if a simple way is used to create a template, you should search for one on the Internet and get through the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & dicate; can be done in the menu tools directly from & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; and its possibilities, the handbook should be consulted to Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly with the reading of the chapter Working with the Editor of & Kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical and latex; command reference which can be called over the Help LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex. this means that in this way, when you click\\ par to\\ or\\ bigExcel only\\ par is selected.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with pressed left mouse button, the selected text will be automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse different kinds of source code and highlight these. for example, the & latex is different; -commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many wizard can add additional bounce marks. it is a separate type of bookmark within the text. the items edit buttons or the corresponding keys allow the jump to the next or last jump brand. thereby, this jump brand will also be highlighted so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the key aspects of using a program such as & kile; although & kate; already excellent opportunities offers, in & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; -Source code adds always many environments and groups and therefore support & kile; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Select a complete paragraph (group of lines that contain an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source text. the only exploiting thing in & Kile; is that the paragraphs are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Choose the word under the current cursor position. this selection has also an extended meaning as this command also includes and latex; -Commands with a return stroke (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, it can be removed first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & kile; provides the keyboard shortcut Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & kile; offers with own commands for a faster possibility. under Edit Removal are the following commands to delete the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is included in the description to edit output paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in latex; therefore & kile; for further orders under Editing Environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command jumps to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command jumps to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the location of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is set before or within the\\ begin {environment} command, the cursor will jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the overview can be quickly lost. this command closes the most recently opened environment so that the nested surrounding structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special orders for the & latex; groups that are determined by braces {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that correspond to those from working environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command jumps to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the welded clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly closing bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the curly clip of a & tex; -group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested group parentheses, quick overview may be lost. this command closes the last opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple quotes are used as bed for use. for the practical implementation, the character is used in & kile; the sign "used for two simple quotes." & kile; knows this case and leads to two closing statements for latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of the double quotation marks can be set up under Settings box... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">You can also use custom settings (e.g. nemgerman or french) and thus German or French quotes. many other languages are available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift; Enter key & kile; enter an intelligent line break. if the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), add & kick; not just a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Complete the current line with\\\\ with a closing line break within a single table environment.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is intelligent enough to support pre-set & latex; - or custom environments. these can be added under Settings Kile; Setting up... LaTeX to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables environments and thereby all Et characters (amp;) among each other. while pressing Shift; Alt; amp; searches & kile; after the next tabulator in the above line. although this tab does not have the corresponding one, add & kile; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already offers a good source code completion, it has been added in & kile; three different modes are built-in. three of them work according to need and the other two are for automatic processing. all these modes can be set for different work modes under Settings Box... can be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment will begin with the command\\ begin {environment} & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input is removed and thus the complete list of letters is removed. on the other hand, the list can also shrink by entering a further letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command. alternatively, from & Kile; jump tokens can be inserted, so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by using the jump stamp Next jump brand and the desired parameters can then be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; Setting up... kile; complete settings can be made to these lists. you can choose different WÃ ¶ rterlistings for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as guardians of the general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the execution of environments. there must always be a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the execution of the execution mode will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for the completion of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">The command to open the environment is automatically inserted and\\ begin {. after that, the environment can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment will be closed automatically. as soon as & kile knows that it is a list environment, it will even include a first\\ item command.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Kile; Setting up... kile; settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the reminder list for the completion mode for & tex; - and & latex; -Commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">The lists can be set up under Settings Kile. the lists can be set up under Settings Kile... Kile can be executed as an example of an example.cwl file, for example the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word processing mode is introduced over the menu item Edit, or the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt spacebar, the letter L will be replaced by the character string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Great WÃ ¶ rter books are not helpful for automatic processing. however, it has been established that many of them are written in a document more than once. thus, & Kile; the completion for all already written WÃ ¶ rter.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the menu Settings... Kile can be executed in full order. here, too, the threshold value for the ad placement can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The complete backup files can be installed in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / complete / mode / the PersÃ ¶ nlichen home folder. mode stands for Abbreviation (abbreviation), dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The Graphics dialog boxes design the inclusions of graphics as simple as possible. to view the basics of the graphics formats, the sections should be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted to ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to examine the results of the work, you need to compile the source code. all building tools are grouped together in the menus Creating compiling, creating converging and creating views.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source text for viewer like & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used the keyboard shortcut Alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI; file can be viewed in the default viewer by means of old; 3, using alt; 4 the DVI; file is converted into a PS file and used by Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the quick-build command, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no embedded viewer is used, a new window will open each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project is being asked about the Project New Project.... The following information for the project is being asked for:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When selecting the file name window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The script function from & Kile; allows execution of ECMAScript code. scripts can be managed in the vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be used in other versions of & Kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts is in & kile; a system-wide object (= Kile) with the following methods has:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a fairly developed system in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages. & Kile; offers a lot of different help for support the users.</seg>

<seg id="1864">A complete Refernz for & tex; and for a lot of friends. this is not just a description of all programs (but some important packages are described) but rather is a complete instruction manual for the & latex; -commands are included and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific formatting.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Because of the amount of documents with which & tetex; / texlive; delivered, finding the right document is not always easy. as possible help offers & tetex; / texlive; the small application texdoctk, which contains a database with all the files to & kile; delivered documents and for a graphical surface.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the advantage is the search for package names or keywords. by & Kile; then only the results are displayed.</seg>

<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting here is emitted by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies regularly, so that during a power outage or crash the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file. also for unsaved documents, a backup is created regularly, according to the set time.</seg>

<seg id="1966">The structure tree settings area can set the visibility of nodes in the tree, the refresh frequency of the tree when editing and how deeply when changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; it means that there may be a valid group for PHP, in which the default abbreviation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins can be administrated. plugins are part-applications from third side, which can be reused by any other part-capable application, at the most known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not at a default location like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, test & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct. select allows saving the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting has been completely redeveloped. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was set, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin drop-down selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. normally appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points are listed with time numbers and conditions. normally appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger. normally appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if necessary, or it divides the plug-in to listen to debugging requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that normally it does not have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugger session starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the sound according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the current line running. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution continues. happens before a debugging request has been started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without providing any information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues. happens before a debugging requirement is given, the execution starts when a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger will execute the next statement in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger will execute the next statement in the script, where possible in functions and include into the script.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to go over the directive and go to the next as if there was no current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered, which is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>

<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tag XML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing else than the only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used, attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (family 2)</seg>

<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is at the top of the & quantaplus; -window to start and check TagXML. a further dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check takes place only when loading TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">This file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this tag XML file should be schema.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2027">The keyboard shortcut assigned to this action. clicking the User Defines button can be assigned to a keyboard shortcut; with Keiner, the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the Detaided settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. using this action, external applications (usually scripts, but on that it is not limited) that change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document) can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even the quick start dialog or the different See in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variables in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way, & quantaplus attempts to find the script in the following places: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replace the current document URL. in case of a local document file: / removed from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; process. if by & quantaplus; only one instance is running, the text will be inserted unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above listed methods, a script can be input from & quantaplus; in the input field input can be specified, which is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, directed to the default output. it can be specified what should be done with the output written to the default output by setting the value the selection field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in the given case there are not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure promotions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New Action knob at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes, and you plan to use it, enable Open Day, if available, so that an entry is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, Graphics Other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the day start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually considered los, rigid, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking on this symbol will insert; startgt; -tag in the current document will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it must still be connected with the action. this happens through the menu with settings actions setting... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the saved symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, if there are any, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to tool bar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separators in several groups. open the tool bar set dialog on Settings tool bar. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how disconnecting the grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by testing all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Backup in the right folder. after NeweXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most noteworthy extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create one & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might want to check in & quantaplus; repository check if someone has already done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. we will leave the first part to you, the second we will treat you here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, documentation HTML files, e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these documentation, e.g. & PHP; 4.2 documentation section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.3 = func1.html tag1 = tag1.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation so something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Getting Started, # Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntac.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the shaft (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You will notice that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but pay attention to & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The contents section is the area of the docrc file that serves to create context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function should be displayed. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily store your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation has been used to the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the failed resources (DTEP packages, tool boxes with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or anyone else. in different places, there is an email-sending menu entry, like DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, tool bar toolbars with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all the others & quantaplus; users can download them. to make a European contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a GPG / PGP key. this ensures the origin of the resources, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for your private GPG key after their passphrase (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys you can select one. in dialog New resource you need to pass the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploading from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), upload tool bar toolbar, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signature. in case of problems, it warns and it can then be canceled. please notify the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the specification of the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, it can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in XML format. there is the easiest way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to use. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definition line: the string that is in! Doctype tag, like HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd will appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when enabled, & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand and grasp the full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize oneself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring them close to these concepts without their understanding & quantaplus; little use browses.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the workspace is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus; all that is marked as global, in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus; stored. this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbar, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project. simply put, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which empowers the common use of special tools and samples from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the tabs with information and the tool bar. please check in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the map tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document appropriate entries, such as closing the current, other or all of the boxes, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or run CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the Editor area will lead to a further context menu with regard to the processed document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), edit the tags under the mouse pointer, help to the word under the mouse cursor or open the file when the string is referred to as a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window are the tool boxes of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of tool bars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus; the tool rails are adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; add to your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now you can insert the data for this just inserted tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog boxes different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow you to navigate to & quantaplus; to navigate, open and browse them. in the presentation with tabs are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool, the & quantaplus; provides. this view shows all the files in the project and allows the administrator of the files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as Add, Remove, Upload or Delete the files from the storage medium can be executed using the context menu that is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; It is open to you all possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; work area. global templates are always available, local templates only usable for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script. by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view you can view the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document to the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands related to navigation and refresher of the tree opens.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, you can quickly change attributes and namespaces. the application system aligned to the content allows you to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project specific documentation can be added, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window, can be reached via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; -scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command displayed. the chocolate page of the tool bar is the option of defining your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar archive via & kmail; if you receive a tool bar in an email, you can backup and load them in & quantaplus; like any other.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting & quantaplus; have, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that is not an older version of & kde; 3 in PATH before their bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for KDE interface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML; Editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; a standalone, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, & quantaplus; now already widely on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then, then & quantaplus; for this the suitable & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of why develop what anyone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; -Scaffolding is not only possible for users and developers to expand as they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for fast web development and has been quickly expanded into a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">For more details, see the help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon's Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not located on it, and the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. look in the section on templates. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error will be reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts the special characters to & HTML, contained in the clipboard, so that they are correctly displayed and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard to & URL; -spelling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily for inserting & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to / off. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful when you & PHP; script error messages are missing!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of script actions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Turn off and switch the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu together with the entries forecasts or next, depending on the location of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents are grouped in the menu according to the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. this allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project to the server. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project is managed. in chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be set with settings actions... added. toolbar buttons will be saved by toolbar toolbar, or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removing a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you will be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the tool bar is present in the next publication). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbar buttons to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load an & DTD; which you or someone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed without the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the store fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbar. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard in the tag menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag setting dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the smart insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; inserting by tool bar is denied when this tag contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items listed above. click on it activates it. click on an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on derkate; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line-end identifier. very useful if you know people using other OS platforms for developing. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document based on the selected DTD; by using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching can sometimes need time or cause unnice graphics. recommended is the map mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode corresponding to the display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open subwindow. by selecting an entry, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog will affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Set up the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & Kate; please find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add which ones and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse cursor, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled preferably from top to bottom, since, for example, the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering name, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the project name in lower case letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here is the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the chosen log will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates for the project are saved. it is a relative path to the project and templates by default. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. in case of serversal scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be linked. if a project is started from scratch, no hooks should be attached.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make an accurate selection according to good manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by clicking on them or by removing the box, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be changed in the menu with project project properties in the menu tree in the subwindow profiles or with the Shift key; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (wildcard possible), which will be ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional options to the top, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The debugger plugin can be selected using the Options button. the debugger plugin can be set using the Options button. the debugging plugin is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Upload profiles can be set in the profile window profiles (see in), as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by hitting one's own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration window, you can turn event actions and add, modify or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs, such as the backing of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was open. this behavior cannot be influenced at this time.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Project Open... from the menu project or the icon Project Open from the toolbar. the dialog Project will be displayed and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing and open with... in the context menu popup with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here different profiles can be selected. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removing the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button will be blinded to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten in the program. this option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the disk save option is not available.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high-loading profiles can be created to upload the project (or parts of the project) to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name on which the files should be copied. either a full-qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should select from & ftp;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your sprue wave, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it after your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be easily read, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbar. there can be many views in one project, that is, by simply swaying the view, various files and tool bars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored, opened or deleted from the Project or Project toolbar, accessible via Settings toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has to do the most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to its own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, toolbars are in & quantaplus; best customisable via the toolbar. use and Add differ. adding tool bar is treated below in the section Adding Toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the icons on it can be set using context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which a new toolbar can be created, other actions such as tool bar can be removed, toolbar can be renamed or toolbars can be executed, which can be specified in the dialog where actions on this or other toolbar can be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries will also be removed and action edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tool bar and actions on them can set up toolbar settings... and set settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially a document skeleton, code snippets and files to link. & quantaplus; uses templates as a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or copy any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations you set for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions listed at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using shortcuts (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree below global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. based on these templates, new documents can be created. usually, more specific documents can be created in appropriate subfolders. you can make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in an appropriate way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents again and again based on a template but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure as you like (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and choose File As Template Save As Local Template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as this is done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily dragged with drag and dropping to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as dragging and dropping or pasting over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder on the right of the file tree or in the project files tree view, select a name for the template and secure it. by default, it will be saved in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal-oriented approach. you can set headers and footers or dynamically connect with & PHP; create, insert files, or link with them. additionally, you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files laid in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder, click on the Folder overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled as soon as the attributes have been inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits for everything except the root folders in the template overview. if a root folder would be set so, it would generally disable templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or reproduced text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying table templates to a folder with special headers / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (pointing to right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source editor, which can be accessed through the View menu. the first mode replaces the source editor by the VPL; editor and the second will divide the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor, in which the changes made in the VPL; -Editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor, a small green symbol shows the default value of & PHP; source text. it is not possible to edit it directly using the VPL; it is not possible to edit it directly using the VPL; to edit & PHP; there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, except that the changes both in the source editor and in the VPL; editor are visible and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor is active, this mode is active, puts the active cursor from one window to another, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; -Editor and the source editor can be set via Settings Quanta.... According to VPL; View, one can choose between synchronisation after a click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation can be adjusted in addition to the time span. basically, the recommendation is: a small span for fast calculators and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select document properties. this allows editing of invisible tags when working with the VPL; Editor. the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the VPL; it is used to reduce the manual coding. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword Keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to create pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the Meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style sheet by clicking on the file open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor, by moving with arrows. under rare circumstances, the cursor behaves peculiar. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleting it by pressing a button or removing button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way on the tool bar, as in the source code editor. it must be noted that inserting tags previously existing identical tags is not removed, e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded by text, must be removed any other orbital tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool boxes such as the table assistant or the Listen Assistant are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; in this release the tables or lists must be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the investigation of style sheets. in contrast to other programs for style sheets, the search for specific elements is possible and the style of the style sheet can be followed.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To compile & xsldbg; successfully compile, except & kde; still the libraries libxslt, libexslt and libxml, which are present at a typical installation of & kde; already available.</seg>

<seg id="2275">Multiple commands require more than one argument. quotes can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument. & eg;: with the command "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;" as argument, a holding point is set in a file called "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;".</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made a lot of changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So that was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, any number of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the merge and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two persons work independently at one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps resolving conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files during merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you merge and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left hand side. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are located in different folders then you can make the typing work easier by just overwriting the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Folders 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 - o Destination folder kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -o Destination folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog will allow you to manually type filenames, select the file browser (file...) or select a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the Open dialog will memorize your selection and display it next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences will be carried out with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merge of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, but a folder is used for A and C, then use & kdiff3; the file name from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field is active and can be edited. however, it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setting button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting the merge / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts then immediately. in Open dialog, you do not need to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions, for example. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively large amount of effort. you'd first need to create two appropriate files, load them into & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you cannot remove anything from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste (instead of copy and paste). in such a case your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Any info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while above the line.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed through the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, you can see the color of which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is good to see in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the merge-column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file does not have rows. if the line switch is checked, the line will be shown on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has a info line with the inscription output:, the filename and [changes] if you edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons jump to the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons are used, each difference must also be resolved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes by automatic merging or by manual editing no further line is left in the group; then it is displayed in these lines of the text & lt; No line in the queue; displayed. this is only a placeholder in the event that you can change your opinion and perhaps again select another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a selection you might copy and paste somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflicts; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy this text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources ignore the options or ignore ignoring C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in any of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side on, side, beginning, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl End, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the window window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the insertion button you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / previous / previous / previous / previous / previous / previous / previous / previous / previous conflict (Ctrl-Photo Up / Strg Image Forward) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-paste). if this is enabled, whatever you select, will automatically copy to the clipboard and the manual copying is no longer necessary, because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix versions use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use cart return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not retain the line end of the source files, so you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be automatically saved when you exit and restore the next start. (menu Setting &gt; KDiff3 setting up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with a fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also sets fonts with variable width to choose, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences will be displayed in italic font. if the selected script does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered diagonally. on these systems, the Preferences button automatically adjusts an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the Tab key. otherwise, a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press Enter or Return, the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, try to find all the identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step, white characters are ignored. even when merging, white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character\\ r 'and a line slot'\ 'at the end of a line, others only save a line slot'\ '. otherwise, files with different sizes may look identical in page-to-side comparison although they are different. if this option is checked, this option will be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">By default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled by default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict is passed.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful if white characters are less important in many files. if you need this only from time to time, then you better use the Choose A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the Automatic Selection also applies conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignoring C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on scanning of folders and performing a merge. look for details under documentation on directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already exists an older version, the original version will be appended to the Suffix .orig. if there is already such a backup file with the Suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you must exit and restart, so that the change becomes active. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally over the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The encoding fields for encoding a short note of what the local encoding is. (this can't be changed here and has purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since encoding for each file is individually configurable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit unicode, but the command command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of command line commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress highlighting changes in white characters in text or oversight columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignoring C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded keypad column. but sometimes you may only see the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply select the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files. current file merge in the merge menu also works if you compare only two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last file used will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first pass this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor that exactly meets your requirements. you can use this function, for example, to cut off annoying parts or correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will first pass this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is used only when the command line is applied. you can write your own preprocessor, which corresponds exactly to your requirements. each input line must have an associated output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command line for line synchronization to convert the input into capital letters: SED\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">The\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you're experimenting with sed, you may start to understand it and maybe you might even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of another preprocessing command for line synchronization. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so practically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' use to separate the replacements. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something different like perl -p -e's / regexp / regexp / replace / SCHALTER 'However, some details are different. where sed\\ (and\\) needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are retained for displaying and merging. the other operations only modify the data that the line interval algorythmus looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-like preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers have to edit a lot of files in one folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge whole folders recursively with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal prior to the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... executes selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you just need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog File.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as the base. if no destination folder is specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, a small message window informs you about the current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folder, only the files that were compared until then are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is finished, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can open a folder by double-clicking on + / - or by double-clicking on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders then it is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case the merge action cannot be automatically selected. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then folders have the same color. in folders, the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green, then yellow will be yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronize mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and when the option is synchronized with synchronize dirs. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that later both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for output file only B; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merge (unsafe) is selected, then examine & kdiff3; the date of the files and display the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the date is identical. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not removed, the merge of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, one file will be executed after the other. status column shows Finish when the merge operation was successful, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is completed, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis, KDiff3 will display other columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specify a destination folder, C will be used as the target in the Three-Folder merge mode, B will be chosen as the destination for two-folder merge and A and / or B will be used as the target for syncing.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder are also displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that might be skipped by the particular entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (keyboard shortcut). to only merge the current entry: select the action of the current element, or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merge actions, a message appears that points to the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window appears with the options to execute, simulate and cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose Simulate if you only want to see what would happen without really making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then executes certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select / continue directory merge again or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog appears. then leads & kdiff3; its work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you encounter a bug, a message and detailed status information will appear. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge (F7 key), you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in any other way before proceeding with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been individually merged, these entries do not merge again. even if the merge was skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered complete. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu from & kdiff3; (Set up menu Setting - &gt; KDiff3...) has now a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit the given pattern are displayed in the elemental-tree. several patterns can be entered. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is * .Folders do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elemental-tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elemental-tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be set specifically with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hiding attribute. in other file systems, a previous dot indicates a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the elemental tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: when the option is turned off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is turned on, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is turned on, the links will be treated like normal folders and searches recursively. (note that if the option is turned on), the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively searches. (note a link to a folder containing a link to itself would lead to a loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that contain no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equally large. this can, for example, be useful when the modification date has been lost. please use caution. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the syncing mode if two folders are compared and no target folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merge will be selected in such a way that both folders are identical. also, the results of merge files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copy of the later file will be suggested as action instead of merging. (this is considered unsafe because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .orig. If an old backup file exists with the .orig extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this will also affect the normal merge of single files, not only the merge of complete folders. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merge view remains visible during the merge of single files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want this, you can disable the option Directory & Text Window on the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file by double-clicking. nevertheless, there is a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu. you can also merge a single file directly without first having to start folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status will be lost if you re-read the directory again: directory -Menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open files located on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, empty character &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes because of the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link appears on a file or folder. then a file will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, the permissions or the change date deviate from the original. (note the option Confidential of the size.) (This is only possible for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently the difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally requires & kdiff3; two full input files. however, if it is applied as a part, & kdiff3; assumes that the input file is a patch file in unified format. then removes & kdiff3; the name of the original files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - KDiff3Part. note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the part mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now Hot Compare) are already available. in addition, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs very long and have learned a lot by staking into sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or they will go on that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in default configure is installed in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the row is treated as not identical.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this is necessary to easily solve a conflict by clicking in the source and selecting the A / B / C button. however, this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, a different editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src is left; appeared and the text can not be deleted. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDE on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You will find a list of recent changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the base folder der & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir indicates the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake are used if you don't have problems with compiling. if difficulties persist, please report to the & kde; mailing lists of them.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copy into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-insert) inserts the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, after changes to these options, you need to re-read the folder with the Update function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also causes identical files not to be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed when clicking the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a thumbnail of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working areas, change their size, end them or move them. this works both in a desktop and at several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button you can move windows within & Kpager; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the blank background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu has only the two entries Pager. if pressed, the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries Minimize, Maximize, On Desktop and End. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows within the & Kpager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is checked, in & Kpager, the names of virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this box lets the & Kpager display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is checked together with name, the names are provided with folder numbers, eg; 1st Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is checked, the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is checked, the current programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager. otherwise, only empty workspaces are displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with their default icon and pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically, & Kpager; in a 2 x N raster, as is known from pager applications in some other Windows-managers; horizontal view displays all virtual desktops in a horizontal and vertical row, which is very well suited for representation laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, which can display and move windows as symbols or with their contents. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & Kpager; and then set up selector switch... lets the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have write permission for the file, you need to register as user root or contact your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & Kpager; part of the kdebase package, you need a working installation of the KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2482">If you like, a window appears as shown above. the main window of the screen shows the larger area of the screen. in the following, this window is called a magnifying window.. The image shown in the magnifying window is an enlarged section of the screen and is referred to as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, the area around the mouse pointer is enlarged as a movable magnifying glass. alternatively, you can display and cause a selected screen area in the magnifying window (selection screen mode) or the environment of the mouse cursor at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window, select the setting mouse pointer. please note that the mouse pointer is currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default node; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can customize the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse cursor in the magnifying window and hold down the left mouse button, so you can capture and move the content of the magnifying window. this is also possible with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & Shift key, or use the & MMB, you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">You can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, save it into a file, copy it into the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the image and more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts or stops updating the display. stopping the update causes the CPU time to go against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the refresh rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the refresh rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a select window will be displayed. the selected area will be shown in a window.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse pointer holds a while at the same place. it is thought to help people who suffer from RSI syndrome (Repetitive Strain Injury Syndrome) and which each mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click when the mouse pointer waits for a while at the same place. it is intended to help people who suffer from the repeettive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and with which every mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Mmousetool; can bypass the pain caused by mouse click and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, because of the mouse, pain may also be caused by the mouse. suffer from pain associated with your computer's use, you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if the mouse helps to avoid pain caused by mouse click, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click as soon as you break the motion briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move activates, makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the move before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can drag the dragging with pressed mouse button. the intelligent shift requires a little exercise, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click performs.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligentes Move is enabled, the shooting time (1 / 10 s) is active. here the time is set, the mousetool; after pressing the mouse button, wait before it will release the mouse button again if there is no moving of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">This feature activates a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these moves will be saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound appears delayed, you can move & kde; to reduce response time. go to Sound & Multimedia, select there sound system and here the tab General. there is a slider Sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">When this setting is selected, & kmousetool; started at every start of & kde; currently only under & kde; available. for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the state after the last push of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">In particular, the smart shift should be switched off at first. if you are used to the automatic mouse click, you will later be able to accept the intelligent shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not display a link will not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rollers that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First of all, you need to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear when you see the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located at the sides of the hole into which the ball was inserted. the dirt and the dirt can easily scrape with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool; when an imposition is just started. if you use the intelligent shift in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be stopped by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you can run a mouse click yourself. this will reset the status of the mousetool, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try and mousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it. but do not park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to make a keyboard input. thus, accidental moving of mouse clicks can cause unwanted reactions. safe zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent shift, but I don't create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shifting is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very likely possible to mark text, copy it to the clipboard, or execute any other action where you wish to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. however, it will probably only cause them problems. here are some advice about this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you are just starting to use the mousetool; instead, select a mouse click at the one end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the cursor to the other end of the text and pressing the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this is done every time when the mouse button clicks; the mouse button plays a sound like a mouse click. later you can use the smart move even without the audible mouse click. but this requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use, the XTest extension for & X window must be installed. this should already be the case on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer strains briefly. this program has been developed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome, causing pain to be affected.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait for a certain time to start a pulling process before the mouse button is released. in this way, drag and drop can also be done with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2534">On the third page (right screen shot), you determine the dictionary for word completion. & kmouth; reads the KDE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of the individual words. additionally, you can synchronize the word lists with an OpenOffice.org dictionary, so that only correctly spelled words are included in the word transcription.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The main window of & kmouth; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences (the lower white field in the screenshot) and a memory of the already spoken sentences (the upper white field in the screenshot).</seg>

<seg id="2619">The file kmail.xml, which is part of the delivery of & ktts; belongs, is a good example. it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent by KMail, and also the expression / local / inbox, since it can be assumed in most cases as presupposed.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of ktts;. for normal work with ktops; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Text is processed in filters before it is sent to the program speech-dispatcher. they are useful for improving the pronunciation, in order to replace wrong spoken words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker or to bypass certain shortcomings of language synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"" "to understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the program" "" "speech-dispatcher" "" "works with a text." ""</seg>
<seg id="2623">The display of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the retained jobs will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these assignments are resumed after the output of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News has the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you are reading & eg; a long text on a web page, you can greet with & kmouth; someone who just enters the room. & kde; -notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every order that you send from the card card orders is a text assignment. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four types of orders are processed in queues except for Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one of these reads, this output is stopped and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filter will never be applied to Screen Readers. they are applied to normal alerts, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently, there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there are still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; will be delivered with predefined string replacement filters that enable the replacement of chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for the reformatting of messages from & konversation; or & kmail; in a better comprehensible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -Transformer use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to another format. included in the scope of delivery; are some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML; included in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With subscriber selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program sent by the text at & ktz; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have set a female voice on the map card speaker, you can read text from KDE news on it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to a speech output. if the filter determines that its rules are not true, it will continue to apply the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text assignment, a message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page. the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the normal filters set up. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the further down menu dialogs will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting of string replacement filters you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text will be exchanged for the respective replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name arbitrarily, it only has to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the string match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Era. the list is processed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. download a list from a file, the entries will be appended from the file to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter is used only if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here. click on the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you click the & Ctrl key at the mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID of running programs can be obtained with the program qdbus; the & dbus; numbers must be omitted. if, for example, and qdbus; the application ID copy-3432 shows, you can only type kopete.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter is only applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box apply. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">In the comparison of words, the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the\\ s word\\ s. thus, the words must be limited to both sides by separator characters (spaces).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; expressions installed, you can use it in the dialogs Add or Edit as help to merge these expressions.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XML; Transformer translate & XML; using XSLT files from one format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such conversions. however, it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the xsltproc program. if xsltproc is accessible via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is enough.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the Speaker Selection filter, you can send text to a particular speaker, which is set up on the card board speaker, or to a speaker with certain features. for example, you can specify that texts from kmail should be read by a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; a text passed to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that the program sends, that sends the text to & ktts; sends, and the properties of the speakers equipped on the map card speaker. with the speaker output filter, you can overwrite the selected speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression. is on your system of the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can click this with one click on the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the properties of the speaker you want. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker will be selected to meet the desired requirements. click on the button on the right to display the dialog box selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your speech settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The Speaker selection filter will only apply to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Apply filter apply if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and punctuation detection filters (SDB filter). SBDs subdivide text into individual sets. this can start & ktt, since only the first set must be synthesized, not the whole text order. this allows you to skip or pause assignments on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the punctuation detection filter. at the first start of & ktts; a puncture detection filter is automatically set up as default. you can modify its settings or add more punctuation detection filters, but beginners will not be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn the device selection by selecting it. switch off the language selection and select text to read. switch on the language selection, change some features and check how the speaker's selection changes. of course, you have to have more than one speaker set up, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktz; then start reading faster with pre-reading, since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block, which can take a very long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or cancel text orders on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be turned off, only removed. do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Punctuator Recognition Filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and insert a tab character (decimal code 8) at the punctuation limits (tabs are automatically removed from the text before filtering).</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages, warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal puncture detection filter out of mistake, you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The card reader selector allows you to overwrite the subscriber settings for the application. the card card will be displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top one on the card board speaker). in other words: no speaking abilities are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker, which has all the features of an established speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & ktts; otherwise select & ktz; the speaker that best meets the originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the speaker you want. if this property does not play a role, do not enter.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property should take precedence over other properties. you can also set multiple flags here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this property. the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language is available if you know that a particular application is sent text in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the field speaker, which is most likely to delete the following, click on the default speaker and then use the speaker that matches the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 means for the last word order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately when it is started. I have compiled Debug support, but I don't get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crash and & ktz; it has been finished. you probably need to register GStreamer. if the problem is not resolved by GStreamer 0.8.x, you may need to install a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application. if I receive a text assignment, freezes & ktts; one. on the console; a message that says: unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">There is a problem on your system that conflicts occur with ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. information for potential solutions can be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I uploaded one additional voice for festival from the internet. I installed them and can use them in festival, but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / Voices. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you have found the voice, to the developer.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio, there is a setting speed. in order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some Synthesizermoduls such as Festival Interactive themselves offer a setting for speed on the map card for speaker setup. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the voice speed are ignored when & tts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for conversion from & HTML; by & XML; (see) or if you are quite courageous, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML-forming filter, and set up the speech speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage to read websites with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker, but & ktz; reads the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the day Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file rejects the GENDER tags to convert from SSML to Saber. the same also applies to VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a separate string replacement filter and now I can go in & ktz; no more set before or behind. on the card-tab orders will be displayed, the job consists only of one sentence. what am I doing wrong?</seg>

<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers, whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and several voices and languages are supported. with many voices you can adjust volume, speech speed and pitch with & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. help can be found in the instructions provided with Festival. if you want to read web pages, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice requires Festival 1.95 beta or later. the voice is still in an early stage of development. if you set up the Russian voices, you need to enter the voices of MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding as for example koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. therefore, look for the Festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to 8-bit Cyrillic such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the MBROLA and Synthesizer. then the Festival takes over the lexical analysis and & MBROLA; generates the audio output. the MBROLA; program and the MBROLA; voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA; no complete voice sharing system is. & MBROLA; generates language from Diphon files. you need additional software to create this diphone. Festival generates this by & MBROLA; required diphone. txt2pho can also produce from German lyrics Diphone. further information can be found under.</seg>
<seg id="2778">In this process, additional wrapper code is added to the festival to use MBROLA; -Voices for speech synthesis. note that the & MBROLA; voice files are not installed in & MBROLA, but in the Folder Festival / lib /. instructions can be found under</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; that allows administration of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings across a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetwork.conf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module will be displayed in the & kcontrolcenter; the network settings module (knetwork.conf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network network settings in & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetwork.conf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow & knetwork.The device at all shows and allows setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed, installed and set up. if network devices are later added, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the Network Settings option is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when the module's network settings are started, this will automatically detect the system used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which best matches the distribution and the releasestand. by marking the setting non-restart, setting can be made permanently. the next start of the network settings will then automatically set this selection.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, which means the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in the system management mode, you can enter system management mode at the right bottom of the module by clicking the button system management mode.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be carried out by the Rider Network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings displayed on the network can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... can be edited in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Default TCP / IP settings are available by default. clicking the Advanced Settings button displays the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start, so no further adjustment is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the manual selection manual, the TCP / IP configuration can be made without DHCP or BOOTP. in the IP address input field, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface while booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the console, you can determine if the address you want is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off, depending on your needs. switch on an outdated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface...</seg>
<seg id="2817">Depending on your needs, network devices can be activated or turned off. switching an activated network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface...</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host in the local subnet that communicates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A DNS support machine replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will trigger this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution part of the name resolution calculator allows you to easily manage this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS entries can be ranked by selecting an entry and / or downgrading in the list with the Hinds or Herds buttons in the priority list.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the Add button... from the group calculator for name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New nameserver dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be added to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group Calculator for name resolution select one entry and then click the Edit button.... It displays the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The name-known machine describes hostname-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used when booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list includes a number of entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this is still in the test that IP should replace 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... The Add New Alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well-known host and click the Add button. if the well-known host has several alias names, press the Add button multiple times and enter the alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of an especially known computer from the list and select Edit... The dialog to edit scanned machine will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the Network Settings module are not immediately effective in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages), if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in one & console; install rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical user interface such as kpackage or the installation tool for your distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but in addition, the development packages are required with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only for experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, in the second section all of them will be discussed by & knetwork.conf; modifiable configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IPv4 has never found widespread use. IPv6 has never found widespread use. IPv6 is expected to be implemented in the near future. therefore, this description is currently concentrating on IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, at & eg; Workstation, the network administrator is the contact person who specifies a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a range specifically reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are usually used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own calculator). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. normally the address is assigned to 127.0.0.1 of its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf, and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections, so it is not surprising if there is a different content to be found in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">The first was to create multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which additionally provided the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective packing. the second aim was to answer a question that my wife asked: how much longer does it take when you secures?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be mounted by & kdat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; spult the tape back and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. recognize & dat; don't recognize the title on the tape, you will be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">If you don't find it, you will be asked if the index index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was involved. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched through flaps in the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; passes by a change of the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape of & dat; can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A tape card must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not correspond to formatting at & kdat;. if your tape drive requires formatting before use, this must happen before you are formatted by the tape of & kdat. floppy disk drives are usually preceded by formatting the tape, but DAT drives are not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the tape name and the capacity, the tape continues. all data on the tape is lost! after finishing the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you must select the files to be secured, which can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right click on the local file tree and select View...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup is started, the dialog box opens for backup. in this dialog, you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">The dialog will display the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives on the record for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right click on one of the archives and select the menu entry...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been started, the dialog appears for verification. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the check.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the verification for the verification, the dialog will appear. this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can redirect the restore, the files to be restored must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore in the menu...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog will appear for recovery. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the restore settings, the dialog will be restored. this dialog displays the progress of the restore process and the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recreate the band index file on the basis of the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this volume. you can create the index on two types of the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can set the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed in backup files, only the files on the same file system are backed up, such as the folder. folders that are located on other file systems can be entered separately in backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">To determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; files had not been fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must point to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmits & kdat; before the tape is mounted, the command mt load to the drive. for some drives, this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try and dat; lock the throw at the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, when resolving the integration of & kdat; automatically ejected the tape. do not use this option with floppy spreaders.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try and dat; to change the hardwary block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you need to share the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & dat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only cover one memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The volume of this string is hostname: seconds, with the hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the tape has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">The program is intended for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users give quick access, for example, on information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Moreover, & ksystemlog enables experienced users to provide quick access, for example, on information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced features with which help the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the screenshot below, & ksystemlog provides functions to easily filter and sort the single log lines of a log file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After launching, & ksystemlog; first, the main protocol file of the system - the system log - will open. if you don't see it, and it opens instead a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely do not start with system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually not found in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or string. the list of the log lines will now be automatically changed so that only log lines will appear next to the filter. in the default setting, the selection field will only display the entry All. then, a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can, of course, select another entry at this point. for example, in the Log File System Protocol, select the name of a process, and then enter the name of a process in the Log File Log File; this will show you & ksystemlog; all the log lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color than log lines of level indication. the color representation of log lines can be disabled in setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain processes (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the To-New lines option in the main window context menu to display all new upcoming log lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">To use this feature, use the entries in the Windows menu to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. to find more current information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named so) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">System V Init quickly becomes the standard for the control of the program start when running the system in the & Linux; this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. the & Linux; kernel looks first under / etc following an init file. therefore, you must ensure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs from the BSD init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service you want to launch when running the system or switching to another running level. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd, etc. system services do not include such things as setserial, which will only be started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one finds it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. be very careful if you have a bit confused, then get it repaired by rebooting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a shortcut to any of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init really system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will be called up with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be invoked with the start argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server running level that only runs httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. I could also have a user running level, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it on that level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runlevels or change the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this only happens if they extract an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you drag them into a new area. to only copy them to a new Runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed previously in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be computed. in such a case, you will have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to add the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is currently no way to restore records thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator key to activate the different work areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a choice above or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runtime, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and paste it into the desired Runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or name of an entry manually, press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / ksysvrc. defaults are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings will be saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runtime levels and now the machine is constantly restarted. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt in linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; intended for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services in these distributions are started simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not conform to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check that all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as eg, Apache or httpd) are simply discontinued when their configuration files are not present or wrongly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that they can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter Customization by & kuser; to start reading.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you have to save them. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or save the entry in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window consists of two flashcards, the user and the user group list. for editing, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog User or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards will only be displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled user restrictions (quota) for users will create a map on which you can customize individual settings. further flashcards appear if Shadow passwords or / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The Card Password Manager will appear if Shadow -passwords or / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card will only appear if for at least one installed filesystem space restriction (Quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable by the file quota user / quota group on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system with limited restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card tabs group informs about the group affiliations of the selected user. the default group to which the user belongs can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can be a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Properties dialog box contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. the Edit or Delete of the selected user or group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot from the default operating system, add, remove, change, add, remove, modify, and more.</seg>
