although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can letter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter , who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous plot of an oil mag@@ n@@ ate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the US .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how to deal with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
with his opinion he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections was the highest number ever obtained by the party nom@@ inated Candi@@ date .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journ@@ alism program , which receives people from all over the world , a deeply beli@@ ever man with whom I was able to talk about Islam and its past .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Wel@@ tan@@ schauung , too , did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who strug@@ gl@@ ed for life long for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump secured his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a hold and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , pres@@ idency a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tr@@ ump voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
it is super@@ ficial and respect@@ ful and interpre@@ ts an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to lift up a man who looks upon those looking at those who look different than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( Ü ) : as much as &quot; R@@ ising the Wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; word game from white in reference to the white and whi@@ plas@@ h , as the great Van Jones called , has killed exactly what America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its President , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he says himself , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
however , with the election Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , there is a huge part of the White Americas that promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
this is Tr@@ um@@ ps Land now , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart to me .

out of misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love of music through rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
the fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world famous kitchen .
for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome them with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence .
but this changed after a coinci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot , who launched a musical project and offered a rare hope of hope to the youth .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the bu@@ zz you learn day by day trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pani , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga .
music from tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments , consisting of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments .
instruments im@@ itate violin , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion all produced from the garbage .
the repertoire encompasses classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article from the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local econom@@ ist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , rec@@ alls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a tr@@ ash @-@ made violin .
today there is an entire orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
every year , the world generates about one billion tons of waste .
those who live with him and him are the poor@@ est - like people in C@@ ate@@ ur@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring performance from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can effectively combat illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports specifically about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content together .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated in Liberia &apos;s waters illegal fishing , before the other coast of Africa visited it .
the East African countries were accordingly en@@ ra@@ ged and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles were quickly mobili@@ zing against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ y authority . he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the region &apos;s waters : it was not possible for him to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million dollars in Liberia , because of the pl@@ under@@ ing of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was founded F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had exp@@ elled the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and help each other where illegal fishing is concerned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Food . this project offers technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected can damage the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once imped@@ ed by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the sn@@ ail emp@@ o , with the information circul@@ ated between individual countries , the actions happen nowadays in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also tracks the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open seas via satellite data .
this makes it possible for the authorities to flag ships that are fishing in prohibited areas . also , suspi@@ cious traffic routes can be discovered - for example those who indicate that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations may show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal record .
countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can then deny the adoption of such ships in their ports based on this information , which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there are substantial financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is financially not worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm campaig@@ ning for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to reg@@ ain estimated 20 million USD of lost revenues , which the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network lose each year because of illegal fishermen who enter East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices , among other things , include actions such as sailing under false flag , bog@@ us license papers , specification of fantasy names , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature conservation areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ fully organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t run my port &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front will work .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspect vessels .
it has exposed criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found fle@@ eting ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we try to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO that also deals with fishing data and offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , switch off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is supposed to help F@@ ISH @-@ i find criminal acts with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform , together with Google and the marine conservation organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and which can be used to display the position of each track@@ able vessel around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; gather together with neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing where - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are indications that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that formerly conf@@ is@@ cated without license and hardly expected to face consequences , now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i meanwhile have a 33 % increase in fishing revenue , since fis@@ her boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets on board , whose use is forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , six countries joined forces to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Security is the goal of bringing even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October , it represented Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship flying under false flag . and not only the ship was also on the road without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets that are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship had also entered forbidden waters , which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going on against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the oceans .

their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela further escal@@ ates : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; reg@@ aining the land &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the im@@ pe@@ achment of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the proposal of the opposition to a referendum on the im@@ pe@@ achment of the government , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , whose eyes were negotiating the political and economic crisis of the country , responded by gathering in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the transfer of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be held in other parts of the country , including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions of Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central north @-@ eastern federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country continues to deterior@@ ate , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the im@@ pe@@ achment of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . ultimately , however , the holding of a new election by the official authorities was blocked .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , Con@@ tri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and winning margins are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum on behalf of many as the only way to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the voting alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round Table of the Democratic Un@@ ity ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , called on the demonstr@@ ators to take part in the support of the National Assembly on 27 October . in addition , a twelve hour strike on the following day and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government headquarters , should continue to block the referendum .
the call was commented on Twitter , among others , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3rd all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration under the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the images of the March , which are published in real time , testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .

on Twitter images that talk about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
particularly large waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own testimony against the police and armed pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards did not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic accounts for the round , which is the extent of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the call for an im@@ pe@@ achment procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado say that 1 % of the signatures are counter@@ f@@ eit .
here is your im@@ pe@@ achment !
on the road !
others consider these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government which , from their point of view , has taken little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis , and rather has been pre@@ occupied with conce@@ aling critical voices :
they took us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or going shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview conducted by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 in D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take part in the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Cór@@ doba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano has now testified in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cór@@ doba against his father .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , was examined for crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father , up to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the secret of family secrets .
in the situation at that time , I thought it was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child at the age of 15 , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at the time , I could not realise that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis has no choice : his father , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano , was a gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the secret service division 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who was accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ os &apos;s son , a man who recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy over the years and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from sports hall to military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have friends with an ERP system .
pass only that they don &apos;t kidn@@ ap you one day and I then have to save you .
the ac@@ ron@@ ym ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , the revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers &apos; Party of Argentina .
a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me that I would be a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
at the base of the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ There the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he told me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - everything possible .
all of this was stolen .
he gave me a small bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it .
that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen objects were turned off and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I looked inside and saw a couch being tor@@ tured on the people .
she looked like a bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied up there .
they seldom attached a man with cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ threw him with water , and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 volts in the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty wind .
years later when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering another ?
&apos;@@ i knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied up and wearing hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
he spoke to &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people kept quiet on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you look so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know this because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero attacked and killed a man there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survivors of the Sur@@ vi@@ vors Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , tried to death the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came here is also the way where the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be laid .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for shooting men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War Gra@@ ve &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
at that time , at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y of war &quot; - as it was named - was .
but when I was in the military myself later , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs that you have opposed to an enemy that you have fought .

but if you go into a house and steal the fridge , record player , clothes , paintings , money ... that &apos;s not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You who steal the cars in the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you &apos;re not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anybody else to do that !
so my father was .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a swe@@ ater pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but nevertheless he brought home clothes .
at that time the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay me on what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to cancel .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of cor@@ p@@ ses is the last disgu@@ sting act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you executed people during the dictatorship , but why do the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why do children kidn@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I repeatedly asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
it would have been easy to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also have families to give up their mortal remains ?
the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a human being .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course there &apos;s always something going on .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the idea of showing my father was born during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked why the whole exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they allegedly defended were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I was posting the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can blame me for being bi@@ ased . I finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 before the end of the trial .
he was charged for 4@@ 16 crimes , including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of one under 10 years of age .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims eventually in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity ; in 28 cases the court suspended sentences of life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the initially 54 def@@ end@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ un@@ la@@ ir &apos;s verdict : murder , torture and rape by ministers . # Es@@ co@@ State terrorism
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military members , former police members and civil personnel .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic landmark for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , established in 1995 , representing the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la found a memorial to be erected there , which is now being led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend your driving license .
the photo was propag@@ ated in the social media .
edited original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend its driving licence , witnessed a very mis@@ fortune in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was mistakenly called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but perhaps also with malicious h@@ ind thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a Ky@@ ot@@ os inhabit@@ ant . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which is published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong English translation was first removed . the name &quot; terrible drivers &quot; was later replaced by the more appropriate , although gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct designation &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported the following about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by the inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News was somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older mot@@ orists in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . according to the police , the share of older mot@@ orists who are involved in accidents throughout the country is quite a cause of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors caused 1,@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
as a result , their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased in the same period .
the especially un@@ named repor@@ ter brought comments to the light in the version of the article published on Yahoo , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently le@@ verage against older mot@@ orists :
the article on the translation error was sent to Yahoo among others :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How accurate is the translation , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think this is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website of En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
for translation you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills in order to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally speaking , the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers in the target language .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French , not from French into English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies don &apos;t employ English as their native language , who could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of native English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees , can still make translations in @-@ house . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the pro@@ ver@@ ted and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences that arise through machine translation show that this technology cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this applies especially to some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious prints that often decorate shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may still be acceptable or at least harmless . but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , it is possible to expect more careful translation .
in the future , the Kyoto City will hopefully use a more reliable source for their translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ al con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel .
other users later wrote that the internet sites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also carried photos of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups opposing the government of Nicol@@ ás Ma@@ du@@ ros .
protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was app@@ alled and recommended to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the Internet .
# Zen@@ sur : activate your VPN .
it seems Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are locked up again .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant since 2014 when reporting protests . at that time , the T@@ elecommunic@@ ations Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ mic later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two more online broad@@ cast@@ ers . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its meetings .
earlier investigations of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to requests from certain domains .
if an Internet site is blocked by the DNS , the server rep@@ lies er@@ ron@@ eous or den@@ ies the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , was suspended on Thursday , 6 April , when V@@ PI@@ TV c@@ amer@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who recorded the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making it more difficult for the Venezu@@ el@@ ans to access multimedia reporting on current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and g@@ athers evidence of other crimes committed by the victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report by Global Vo@@ ices , courtesy of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old she began to work as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money passes their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , more rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof above the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to pay inn@@ um@@ erable days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be aboli@@ shed .
this practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is vacc@@ inated against the Cri@@ means guarantees in general silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , who is their daughter in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family who receives the girl in her and justi@@ fies her exploitation by believing that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise not receive education and might even be star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience it many years later .
sometimes they even never know about it .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the seclu@@ sion in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed ves@@ tiges of violent stro@@ kes .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military hospital Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as an officer in the registration office .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 F@@ errei@@ ra sur@@ rendered to Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered le@@ thal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were responsible for the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go deep in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be no other Carolina in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered than children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers it is much easier to off@@ end the rights of children un@@ punished .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbors of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a prompt investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be ground @-@ breaking - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as labour forces , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , in which her father worked , had to register bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón in Cri@@ mean .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked in the house of her employers between four and six hours each day .
she had to share the time in such a way that you still had time to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went back home and had time to learn .
the more she was done with learning the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve but also did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and to read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to not give faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent but did not obey her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits there again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they thought Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would again speak their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her gent@@ leman was afraid that she would lose the education she had enabled her to lose again , she explains .
but it was quite clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
even at school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about is bul@@ lying and the har@@ ass@@ ment that Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed to when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to me home . I didn &apos;t have a friend in the school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships emerge , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group .

society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which you can share job ads for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay .
the administration of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please report to us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman who also came out of Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she likes small children and is very nice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author of the ad changed once more :
dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with it .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ log to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?

in the course of our history we managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the Early History of Paraguay ) , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ í , and the system of Mens@@ ú ( where the workers were considered to be semi @-@ slaves ) , and the native population was willing to support them in a system of slavery , in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
draft law prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulations concerning the use and benefits of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is adopted by Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be established that is mand@@ ated to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months by adop@@ ting the law , users must register at the site of the site with their proper names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could be a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fin@@ es .
the bill comprising six paragra@@ phs and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as a &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by means of voice , video surveillance and text . &quot;
it is not clear how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration . unclear is also how they should account for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad@@ Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password from the Ministry of Technology to access the Facebook wall . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; senior researcher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I strongly doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
when I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who are requ@@ esting permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a trial .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the legislature &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration on the picture surface is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed legislation against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was intended for those who are found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;
how a Kurdish native of nature protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in Iraq

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working on protecting the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards that ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find less and less loo@@ t .
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the Persian Leopard the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystems &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video states that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera trap , R@@ aza breaks out in sheer joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza loves to show a different side of her country , which is not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and wildlife in Nature Iraq for six years .
it has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to providing protection zones for wild animals in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , documented the progress achieved over the past six years to re@@ build the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; in March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was one of the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast that had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , as the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was still experiencing a nuclear accident , and alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local point of view what progress has been achieved six years after , in order to re@@ build the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those affected .
the housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare @-@ houses were completed in the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures was reported by Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , where 80 per cent of the planned spare @-@ houses were finished .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light at 70 percent .
however , even six years after the catastrophe , Ev@@ acu@@ ated von Beh@@ el &apos;s shel@@ ters ( mu@@ g@@ ages , cas@@ et@@ su jus@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) have to be reloc@@ ated to final spare @-@ houses .
after the triple disaster , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees that met after disaster in homes were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by disaster have opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of fisher@@ y ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident have largely affected agricultural land in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 per cent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agriculture can be used again in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 ac@@ res of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures tourism has largely recovered , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far away .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 per cent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dw@@ ellers are more difficult to earn their living .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to obtain an overall picture , the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and the ev@@ ac@@ uation . she asked her about the status of the reconstruction and also , how her feelings about the ts@@ un@@ ami risk have changed .
in their introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to find out more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents had taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents found that still not enough was done in the field of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention .
as for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition to commemor@@ ate the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper increased its attention to the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
from 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 thousand people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 a little more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent spare @-@ houses .
at the end of 2017 , some 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated ones who still live in Beh@@ el @-@ shel@@ ters are older than 50 years old . they are well known because the efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are competing with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020 .

when people come across from other countries speaking another language , the differences seem to be greater than the common ground .
after a while , however , one often sees that a more connects than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention when reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they have felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country borders .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten by the police in nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia had struck him with a stick against the head . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him this Saturday and now put him in an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
local journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police were known in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the investigation of the incident of the active service .
the pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ol@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video footage recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs are hur@@ rying about it .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in the social networks .
the clip shown below shows the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family , who lives in another state , Internet users have meanwhile donated 10,000 Brazilian rel@@ ays ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado invites more violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás has experienced a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he sab@@ ot@@ aged the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a stick in his face .
police Hand@@ gri@@ ps
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , police officers set up a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the deputy Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refra@@ in from violence against prot@@ esters .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media fl@@ ou@@ led street protests by directing the focus to another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported on a broken glass window in order to depic@@ t their titles in an illustr@@ ative way with a photo .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o fav@@ oured a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window plate than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
you also have to acknowledge this if you are strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate significance , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Des@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ alization of For@@ gotten Vill@@ ages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed the doors ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site .
it was two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ zed in the sugar cane factories .
after firing the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the framework of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ig@@ ned and commu@@ te daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , rising every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are in operation because they were received .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
a few decades ago , the news would have been a subject of concern for the country , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality had already seen better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the crus@@ hing of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that can produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar will remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Food and Food Organisation .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar exports would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly enter history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said F@@ ide@@ l Castro &apos;s first words during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come .
it was officially recorded documents which differ@@ ed only with regard to the parts that would be removed , addressing the address and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was covered and the letters came more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the closed factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the de@@ commissioning of the factory in which he helped .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years .
Cuba &apos;s most developed industrial area and most important work@@ station was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives to the jobs and services generated by the plants in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know if during the M@@ amm@@ oth speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President saw in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to tone it off , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ate the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged even other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they were replaced by spare parts .
without the prospects of the future , many young people also left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production serves not even for the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
nin@@ ety @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring a pension of two thousand p@@ eso per month to the old soldier , to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a subordin@@ ate person , yet he does not forgive the lies you told him .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes to retirement with 65 years , not because it lacks power , but because it is bitter .

the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agog@@ ue David H@@ od@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group The Nor@@ th@@ stars .
the workshop concludes that the young participants discuss topics like &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ Sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , relates the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a street section in Western Canada where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ enligh@@ tened .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences of global@@ isation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always speak native languages to the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have recorded , the chor@@ us is sung at Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly of the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English translated into German :
sometimes I feel like no one ever is interested in me
but I try to go on my days on Earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry
because as youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and also move forward in our youth
this is how they can do what they intended for the Creator .
in the commentary part , the reader and advoc@@ ate of the Cre@@ e language , Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the St@@ rop@@ he to Sil@@ verb@@ ank ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant in Japan
plastic dishes ( mu@@ gs , mu@@ gs . ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , are located near the entrance to sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( for painting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of any dish that is served in this restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers see themselves in these plastic dishes and decide whether they can enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
there are a large number of these small companies in the to@@ ki@@ er district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ash@@ i that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend is turning them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos published this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new plastic rib@@ bons decorated with plastic rib@@ bons as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin cool@@ ants mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences is becoming more and more complex .
in this case an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as a mobile phone .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ic .
some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; w@@ ow , cool , now can I decorate my mobile with laugh@@ ing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic courts can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ pleasantly .
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of mel@@ ted ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands made of dried salmon .
other bizarre plastic dishes can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ash@@ i , which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the missed and killed appear regularly only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reporting on drugs bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
there are behind every cor@@ p@@ se , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , which aims to give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who were involved in the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities therefore have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how afraid of life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we are preparing ourselves today for the task we have set ourselves to go and search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but they don &apos;t get paid off because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just have to show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community of conflicts , frag@@ ility and governance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been familiar with illness and sen@@ sing journ@@ alism for several years now .
I pass newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the titles with images that actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it is not normal that my 10 year old cous@@ in thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ ckers ) if he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me this is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of humans is incredible for me , if the death of six people and the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by making them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ob@@ ses@@ sive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they remain spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they do not stir and remain silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family was sack@@ ed with threats . &quot; it describes how armed criminals squee@@ zed money from their business month after month , until they end not only destroyed the business , but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain about it never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap you or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether crying would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted sentim@@ ents , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is a fa@@ ther@@ less saying that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , cook potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father , who was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez really looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as a result of the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the citizens &apos; council for public security and government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor called 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mor@@ als per day .
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed combat against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ tured the country over the past four decades in an understandable way .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ real words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this contribution and the pages to which he links , include images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tank truck crossed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died there .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the roads in the region have become dangerous paths filled with po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank truck fell victim to it .
official representatives described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses , including a cinema nearby , which was full of people watching the World Cup .
houses ro@@ uted and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burnt to ignorance .
a picture titled &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; by the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident depic@@ t the horri@@ ble scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are str@@ ung on the floor while persons watch them .
but here the story doesn &apos;t end .
over the years , the same photo has been recorded several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses dras@@ tically reported atro@@ cities that they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch resident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only by satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be depicted .
the attack was also unclear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo as it was wrong@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and scope of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this impro@@ per use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ concep@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as proof of mass kill@@ ings .
another step further brings personal comments like this , wrong@@ ly , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media related to the supply of arguments .
the picture taken from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash report published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee could strike blows , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported of the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts appeared as follows , who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page , which in 2012 fal@@ sely claimed that Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ an Being said that monks and politicians were involved in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed to being this statement , but did not have the picture taken from the DR Congo .
the global reach of false data
traces of these false dec@@ ou@@ pling dates back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information borders can exceed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) , which are very similar to the mentioned image of the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ h of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed false reports , some others have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of impro@@ per use and linked them to the respective countries , on the basis of what they have been published on which page they have been published .
from the countries listed below ( in some cases linked together ) several examples may be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases that can now be fully felt ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News frames .
examples of false connections from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
the grey countries are examples that , according to the metadata and information available through Tin@@ Eye , are likely to show counter@@ f@@ eit samples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image of the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

T@@ wit@@ ter@@ posts after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre like this one , who used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; have clearly seen no pages as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster that refu@@ te this .

this page used the picture as a proof that Muslim Christians killed Nig@@ eri@@ an Christians .
this statement was re@@ fut@@ ed by a Greek fact check page 2013 and once again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a federation of students of the@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
an inhabit@@ ant of the old town of P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o from Tren@@ to posted this news to his side in order to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo was shown as proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of the ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , with one on the one hand a tweet , expressing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to deli@@ mit the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being pursued , as the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a right to judge what they came to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately clou@@ ded news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with respect to Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this adjustment , which was published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of sc@@ ents that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often distributed by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fiction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page wrong@@ ly claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein had admitted in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the picture taken from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release the picture is still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the now @-@ deleted , Catholic @-@ related news page An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was later circul@@ ated in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 , the paper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ man@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the DR Congo &apos;s image emerged with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay a greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as proof of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and ret@@ ou@@ ted more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message auth@@ ored by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false .
from the embassy in which the image of the DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ inet mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos was dist@@ anced .
there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also points out but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have picture file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original publication of 2010 , the picture might ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and Pictures
there are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions on silence related to the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are a lot of people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy .
this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and em@@ bel@@ lish the real horror of what actually happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the dis@@ semination of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that the retention of images of refusal is equivalent to recognis@@ ing the tragedy . sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images are des@@ en@@ si@@ ti@@ zing readers and viewers and they have the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study investigating how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent represent@@ ations in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used from context or completely impro@@ per nature .
however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name of un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to be translated at all .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these insur@@ moun@@ table words are well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sour da@@ des ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish Sob@@ ota ) .
but everyone stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or phrase is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from the Ta@@ p @-@ cla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - ti@@ ring around your parents in recognition of the way around you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the Hun@@ sr@@ rics language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that one feels after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his Blog about :
they de@@ vise other cultures , reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site want to publish even more of these &quot; insur@@ moun@@ table &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally sets in at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country have stepped over the banks .
after a statement by the catastrophe center of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and slu@@ dge .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe locations .
the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly went back .
health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods are wor@@ sen@@ ing the den@@ gue crisis , Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are on the way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the water p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five were completed for the transport of emergency deliveries to the residents included in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian assistance .
if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ y@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 , if you need help in this area .
the taxi call @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle for pick @-@ up assistance and donations . they were then forwarded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross free of charge .
they also launched an &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than one thousand requests and 150 successful boat ret@@ ali@@ zations for floo@@ ding and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need of security and provide assistance .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , with the population of Sri L@@ ank@@ as being the long way up to the restoration of norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
Dam@@ als in January took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I entr@@ ust to her my four @-@ year @-@ old daughter , she entru@@ sts me with her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we call even slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next , we call for rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some think the iconic picture of a woman with a head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , others chant slo@@ gans against hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things don &apos;t concern you , or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I &apos;m not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they have under@@ gone me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look alike .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective conception that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit in there , have to be dis@@ car@@ ded .
to be mi@@ tig@@ ated
I &apos;m not alone .
this has happened to the poet , whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the western conception , the religion Rum@@ is was deleted as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist paintings of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid disman@@ tled the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures also stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to arrest them .
I have been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous N@@ arr@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the USA couldn &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this narrative will fail to acknowledge that when French Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forced Saudi , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body that these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this powerful narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it looks beyond the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought along with slave ships here .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has so deep and flaw@@ ed our collective imagination that Si@@ kh &apos;s and children often become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of the 1.7 billion
in the news industry , we do more than just stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create N@@ arr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the foo@@ thold of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here where seven million Muslims make up the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious groups in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population is African @-@ speaking Americans .
six of the ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants origin@@ ating from 77 countries .
the parents of the author 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rant parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan re@@ invented the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were bank@@ rupt Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and an American one ?
sometimes when people ask me why I am not eating pork , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or my handy hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims bear with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ p@@ ah W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ ok@@ er , we don &apos;t carry all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for false information that our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , have manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in more than just a stranger that tears a woman &apos;s head@@ sc@@ arf .
or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques across the USA , see below .
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer .

use approved .
I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but to be a Muslim only was born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they rever@@ t to the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslim , if she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ritual ritual with my daughter if I hold her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arabic verses to protect the Quran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always a part of my shadow .
the author &apos;s grand@@ mother , when she gains an ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , eventually poses with her sisters in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging is the image of my grand@@ mother mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; how they won a competition in the art of flower arrangements in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of her that I can see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings of old Su@@ fi @-@ saints ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that can be almost mem@@ orized .
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers they told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : O God , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people , which - for centuries - was colon@@ ized by an &quot; empire &quot; which a company established with the name of Ven@@ erable British East In@@ dies Company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author was in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather we@@ eps .
in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan was weeping for his family in the K@@ ash@@ mir family , who was not allowed to enter his arms in half a century .
belonging to it is to know that there are millions Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game .
to be Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; colon@@ ised &quot; all down to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first pilot bomb of history was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir@@ an under@@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I had ever been and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion go deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our in@@ con@@ gest@@ ed history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across each continent apart from the Antar@@ c@@ tica , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is lie buried beneath the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy struck the US and the suspect has a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slave .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this land .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life count .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple lines , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing ambig@@ u@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals are building a structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim registr@@ ations that began with President Bush and extended to President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of immigration officials who take a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders to people from just the countries it bom@@ bed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is largely targeted by Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs we throw off on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed participants a scientifically un@@ correct picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims got the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply involved to sof@@ ten the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are going back for decades to recognise the roots of our fears and the flaw@@ ed and dangerous pic@@ torial prints that we make in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast See Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ man of Muslims ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; S@@ ay Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print more Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned for this difficult global point of time in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years before they had not yet given them ; now they have ma@@ stered large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today made me an un@@ connected Muslim .
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ bs in my speech .
things that may ar@@ ouse memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may lie where someone is made to a &quot; other . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the Bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations take place as part of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where is Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars will be fought and people are included in the public presentation four decades ago , even scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of how my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the occupation that we do not have a president who feeds chocolate cake , while he already feeds broken countries and &quot; to other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of big cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , there is a risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the cre@@ ators of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening is often connected with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening , to appreciate , to make sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers first introduce their history in their own language and then translate or explain it in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers , their devotion and representation lead to the fact that the audience gets involved .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this turn , the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ tr@@ ara tells the f@@ ables of the rab@@ bit and the Bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were completely with me !
until now the events of Treas@@ ure Language stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities and the organizers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling .
Puerto Rico demands real@@ ignment of public debt by the US
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 . the March started with the Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Civil Front for the Ne@@ ural Review of Deb@@ t ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting in Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of the re @-@ determination of debt have also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debt can be held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management board without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding compensation , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with dec@@ lining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
this is why the so @-@ called &quot; Zentrum für Neue Wirtschaft , &quot; a non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure .
measures imposed from the outside will be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration was named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night watch for light and truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a researcher in the France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house published by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) .
the book published last year and is available here license @-@ free contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what the real costs associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and make sense of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteer who has been det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was removed from the list of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on October 3 , 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that pus@@ hes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , right away .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of sometimes extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for open source and digital activists has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the military police had taken Bass@@ el as a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and notified them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his place of residence and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was more predic@@ tive than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the world &apos;s most important archaeological sites , was the cross of numerous civili@@ zations , and here the Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he started working with the work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but the world .
this campaign in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el gave me English even when he was already in prison .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in prison .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together for a year together on the book .
she s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed the texts to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available free of charge .
book envelope by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens at every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace us ,
that each of the dangers does not matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kl@@ es and guards
I forget the thr@@ ong of the prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to take back all the moments ,
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of Bass@@ el &apos;s imprisonment , G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
one year passes , my soul
during the period of time
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
its history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime Bas@@ har al @-@ Ass@@ ads , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tor@@ tured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in prison until 2016 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambique : Director , convic@@ ted of corruption , returning to previous post
Mos@@ ambi@@ ans responded with anger on a corruption case where a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state machine after half of his prison sentence where corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ end@@ ants on account of violations of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ as ( about 800 000 Euros ) .
the money came from public funds from Moz@@ ambique &apos;s airports , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his return to the company , which happened on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the application , there would be no reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old position , as the company did not execute any disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
but many inhabitants don &apos;t like the action well .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we take note is that the company should also introduce a disciplinary action against the contrary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company apparently remained silent and did not initiate appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ war@@ dly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after being sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been served .
he could hold paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will gladly pay for his silence .
to the contrary !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director does not have any moral :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already so mas@@ sively insul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality and serves to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead has only served themselves by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long prison term .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief belongs to the prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el not only to remember the Moz@@ ambique as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , one @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator .
one of his most famous oral portra@@ y@@ als was when he vigor@@ ously affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious human being is able to sell also the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not that way . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat for 10 years and was free .
and today , the company , with which he res@@ ig@@ ns money , is under contract again . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ Standardi@@ z@@ czy@@ k ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) May 12 , 2017
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo from the Journal @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( in German : @ Truth ) states that crime pays off in Moz@@ ambique :
in fact , to be in # Moz@@ ambique th@@ ief and servant of # F@@ rel@@ im@@ o pays off . # Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , sentenced to long term imprisonment , returns to # airports of Moz@@ ambique - E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo ( @ E@@ mil@@ do@@ Sam@@ bo ) May 11 , 2017
Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means ch@@ ick pe@@ as or fis@@ sur@@ es .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took its posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lov@@ ingly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word commonly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word have been cens@@ ored in order to express their use .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamental mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ ac@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ f@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a spiritual way , if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - very similar to rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook ought to be more analytical before releasing all posts that were suspected of spreading rac@@ ism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ t@@ ook .
what should be done instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjacent words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech have received a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... as I became aware of this new Facebook policy , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours , because the mail didn &apos;t correspond to the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply trying to show their opinions against the hate speeches of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community to ask for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ as curr@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts .
if they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ orship provided a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun via Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech but still removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to check out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased .
among other things , the hate language in social networks is to boost the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has critic@@ ised for his failure to bring out the balancing hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context rather than focusing on code @-@ concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is at the end with the to@@ e
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law that should ban this practice , so that the age @-@ capable age is now at 18 .
before this change of marriage , some members of Hin@@ du and Muslim religious groups adher@@ ed to the practice , and in May 2016 it came to a great public out@@ cry . at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ j@@ aj , the leader of the inter @-@ religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this occurred despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights , which defines min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every man under 18 years of age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN statistics for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were married to 15 were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the statistical centre office of the country confirmed that between 1997 and 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements aimed at aboli@@ shing the laws of child@@ birth followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the inf@@ ant , they ought to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition provided tensions in this actually un@@ complicated situation , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all .
but early 2017 , the draft law against the inf@@ ant was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave a status update on Facebook , which once again posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the inf@@ ant was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes for that and not one vote against it .
after being decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media users were thri@@ lled , because the laws of child@@ birth have finally been changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said :
there has been too much time and unnecessary talk that has veiled the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the inf@@ ant is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost every price .
while Abel Jackson thought it was long enough to put away the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was happy that the day finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al - Thomas , which states : , , Excell@@ ent news !
the marriage network has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 on the other ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the age @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the design for the change of the marriage network was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties who were contrary have voted for the law .
the to@@ e is legally not allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ bearing shiel@@ ds .
many thanks to all activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hin@@ du organisation of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal action , the law should be passed and he seems to resolve his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al @-@ ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite right , if Mahar@@ aj wanted to proceed against the law , most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
rather , instead of talking about the problem , instead of talking about the problem that the state , our daughters , protects them from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled males who are opposed to them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the pedi@@ gree is legal or still the norm , although there are laws which prohi@@ bit it .

by mirr@@ oring websites Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the Wikipedia page in English was shown on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally dark@@ ened .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle for more than a month .
day by day becomes more clear how important the platform is for users to find and share useful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series oppose the blocking .
although many techni@@ c@@ ased Internet users are used to using conversion tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia , as recently described in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet since 2007 are held after the internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , several mirror sites ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) have now appeared .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( thus machine @-@ calcul@@ ator connections ) which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is available , however , in spite of legal ban .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS tells about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we all started to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents in a de@@ centralized and distributed manner .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it was merely a screen@@ shot and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pe@@ ditions , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ Page of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirror sites when locked in each country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member and employees at mo@@ z@@ illa at Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
there is no complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
you access another URL that is not the original . that which you can see is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server transfers the request to the right Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kin@@ dle pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he ought to know &#91; it &#93; , for he was already facing tig@@ ers face to face ,
a tiger is not disturbed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ z@@ he@@ k appeared . he immediately sat down , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to make recordings of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could shoot a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations .

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women with great care avoid speaking the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit they respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , maintain this practice alive .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a bog@@ us court and cast off by her family and the village community after having responded to a married family with name .
the tradition of not nam@@ ing their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer rights to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , entered a unique club and became the main topic in the city .
it is a place only for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs there are in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and campaig@@ ned for the mining of the patri@@ archy .
for seven years , Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with her video camera to cover practices such as inf@@ ant &apos;s marriage and the exile of HIV and AIDS and leads these clubs .
she tells how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors for change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion was of women who did not name their hus@@ bands in their name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open up the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women can easily identify .
not saying lou@@ dly the names of their hus@@ bands is a custom that they have all du@@ ly maintained and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini believes :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not stop this is seen as a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband on behalf of her husband , wanted to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on by his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini launched its first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini requested every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so forth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini says :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was chu@@ ck@@ led just in front of her ; another decided to leave all the frustr@@ ated frustr@@ ations against him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
even in the rush of adren@@ aline about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands in their name at home .
and they kept their word .
during the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into the head of women : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a student of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead indicating the mar@@ ital status :
why do women only show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he did it too .
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped bearing him .
the other women have not completely stopped working , but they think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it in some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry who could hear what &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their birth@@ days with cake for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothing .
some women in the group have carried only sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ ine @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare .
after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , the mor@@ als associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed their own pair of cur@@ tas ( over@@ shirts ) into a discussion round so that women could wear them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and raw ini is sure they will do it .
on the question as to whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far we have only taken small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped saying the name of their husband .
some , including me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red at any time on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as viol@@ ating more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - are at the end of a hard @-@ to @-@ navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they realise that they sit in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini declares :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the people here have become quite clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .

good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could that be for a day ?

bald men are drag@@ ged and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia police warned the people that bald men in Moz@@ ambique could be the target of attacks .
photo : different Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald individuals for organ trading , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , concerns the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ an@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently , the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
it would give the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC declared .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the target of mur@@ ders for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN in South Africa conducted a mission in South Africa to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
attention to bald men who travel to Moz@@ ambique &apos;s bald men in Moz@@ ambique are aimed at ritual attacks , warned the Moz@@ ambique police after the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men because of their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ lau , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ ky Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police had already followed the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the deaths of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for presumably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has given cultural motifs and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victims were in the head of power generating wealth .
during the last days three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
on Facebook , Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared the chron@@ ic@@ le of the B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Moz@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME is ashamed to go to the street where people would be ashamed to have sex against good notes , work and other achievements , a nation in which people would be honest pursu@@ its , or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald are hun@@ ted for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re hum@@ our .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , researcher of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique , and enthusiastic Twitter user twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange , and the police officer Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both gl@@ atz@@ kö@@ p@@ fig are :
Mos@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very concerned about the murder of bald @-@ headed people .

we are deeply shocked to experience the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply felt con@@ dol@@ ences towards his family , friends and those who have known and loved him .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) took a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and took part in our Arab blo@@ gger meeting in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ sel &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who spent themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband was sentenced to death but did not give any further information .
Bas@@ tia &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a heard of Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , Bass@@ el &apos;s work as a pioneer of the open web movement will be the honor .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the individuals and organisations that have been campaig@@ ning for his release in the last five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , including the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
inn@@ um@@ erable of those arrested or forci@@ bly displaced by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 nothing less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have been put to death in custody , so the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : N@@ eti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel Prize winners and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his attorney announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the end of June .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion , &quot; following the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Li@@ u case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ man relates that he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or allow him a treatment abroad .
while some countries critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some foreign reactions .
United Nations , United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad to have a treatment .
Norway Finn@@ s for Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway was st@@ alled after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China since exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was not able to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union - European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ u as she announced in an explanation on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told him that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would like him to have the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as it helps him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokesperson for the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on 27 June that the news agency AF@@ P announced that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US embassy &apos;s call came to an angry response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and to make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley said that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system as well as international obligations .
the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .
I call on China to release Nobel prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condi@@ tionally so that he can embar@@ k on a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany and Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns as to whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called on Li@@ u to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues :
Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release the rights for exercising these rights .
France - France
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France called on China to release Li@@ u on humanitarian grounds on 29 June :
all necessary measures have to be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually receive it .
Taiwan Floor Vacation Rent@@ als
the Council of land@@ marks in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who are using peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese law@@ gi@@ ver Yu M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama - The Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on 28 June around Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u Well being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or Country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised at an international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be regarded as a city .
this re@@ mark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supports that Singapore should be considered a city .
... nobody asked if New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , one hears that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ able : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries , &quot; in view of which he appeared inevitably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old Ly@@ re appears again from author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the end , the responses to his American guests in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were really non @-@ answers to his American guests regarding our press , our ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system .
he cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ aged appropriate questions with non @-@ rational art .
Rachel Z@@ eng challenges Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion since she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country belongs to our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clear this point as long as he was paid up to be part of the government of Singapore .
by publishing his comment on the blog , he points out reviews about the criticism that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ easy even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who , as the leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what I expected - be I with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes he is right and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review de@@ parts the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Herr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faith@@ fully commit a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a joy of joy ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements are of serious importance .
why do the Singap@@ or@@ ean do their military service , do they defend only their city but not their country ?
who must pay back our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade is ten@@ ding to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and was always a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country first of all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should speak more of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , with rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et is to be presented .
the latest install@@ ment of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question raised to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been living in Japan since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Hock@@ ey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps cook inside rage when they are held for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who does not know himself , there is little that distinguishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand , ... .
so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - ahead of Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried little Map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter if you &apos;d conf@@ use me with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first : to be called &quot; nice &quot; means basically to be sp@@ aci@@ ously - just like the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian double @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada were really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; cute &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means being un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and not paying attention .
it can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from things happening around you .
I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with the neighbours .
we lack the warm , open kindness which I now connect with my American friends .
thank@@ fully for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau em@@ bodies the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ ding Thailand &apos;s j@@ un@@ ta
a pop band famous in Thailand has released a music video that is par@@ o@@ ding the j@@ un@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , the country continues to rule .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells the prescri@@ ptions of his girlfriend .
although not politically , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the j@@ un@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Thailand was even blocked after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular as it relates to the situation of the country under the j@@ un@@ ta rule .
take a look at these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political issues which Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 Rules of the Girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision @-@ making on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adjustment change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people considered by the j@@ un@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often exploited by the authorities in order to arrest activ@@ ist and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army which monitors and prosec@@ utes the online content and prosec@@ ute persons accused of having committed the monarchy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand employs a strict &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
the video even shows how people are thrown into a black v@@ ans before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in jail because they supposedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened long prison terms , they should insul@@ t the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the 2014 protests .
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost towns in eastern Asia Minor

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ n@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages in the northern part of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ Chil@@ ava are located in the coal bas@@ ins of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Dep@@ ha@@ zia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , mostly Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period there were still more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people living in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district had been 16@@ ,000 people after it had barely asc@@ ended for over a decade .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called the ch@@ ry@@ os@@ ch@@ kov@@ kas , symboli@@ se the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are decay and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he starts talking and it &apos;s hard for him to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were communal centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all served by the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and contributed their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
about fifty inhabitants live in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ che@@ v , which houses one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies where the laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera they immediately reti@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother was forbidden to let us take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter , the district administration offers free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman called Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighbourhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial support from her daughter and insi@@ sts she is supporting her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly rent is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit ourselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could grow Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s partner Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she rec@@ alls the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they had not the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 children &apos;s money for every child .
her husband works in the coal mines .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once located , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxiety .

you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived as it was right for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; is home to migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez manages a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org on 19 April 2017 and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold @-@ colored earrings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm whatsoever .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - but there are hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants arriving here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , come the people in full small bus@@ ses and start calling from the upper part of the coast : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some slept on cardboard outside .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they can &apos;t pay , she mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently .
I asked him if M@@ om Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he respon@@ ds with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very cute women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have lived in Brazil but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the North .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the way and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a builder at construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we will never leave her again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her that her guests often send her text messages when they went away to greet her or to report her about the course of her trip .
she explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have included migrants in their small house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and found that the bus tickets to many African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after three years of living , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his workplace .
the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova , Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez , tells me that he fled in Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to squee@@ ze money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single educ@@ ator , offered him their roof .
a few months later , the family still lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full guests .
in the ais@@ les , travellers still consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she leaves her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with afri@@ can hair lich@@ ens she has made a customer , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she introduces her to me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; you have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the city Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app is intended to prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the authorities also made use of the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they had installed the app .
in the police report , the app was able to identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and the distribution channels of the terrorists , along with illegal religious activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with under@@ age filters is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while reporting on digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focuses on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in distant , repres@@ sed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the areas of conflict , the authorities often assign extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shut@@ downs .
the media outlet , based on Twitter , published photos from a check@@ point where polic@@ emen check the residents in@@ discrimin@@ ately whether they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , it could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use appliances intended for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest @-@ technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also published a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which indicates that the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions given by the City Council to minimize dis@@ semination of illegal content . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all government branches , authorities and institutions connected with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a current report of Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on June 27 , in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , the authorities published an order with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; with local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is &apos;s personality rights of three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political communications .
sleeping or Death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything you need is missing .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able , both from within and from the outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one that honor its name all honor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one that has desc@@ ended into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when reality takes you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es out after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will become aware of your existence even when the Earth is spinning on the A@@ xis of Un@@ ity . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents have built and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security servant put it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by even destroying the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cri@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the neighbor@@ hoods sought , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , mo@@ tion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I didn &apos;t put high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ffed to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things were somewhat cal@@ med after the power supply in the neighbourhood stopped working .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice re@@ fut@@ ed by silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined a sum@@ p@@ tuous picture that fulfilled my expectations completely .
in such a moment you are aware that you are releasing the mind out of the lamp , but it simply does not interest you in the slightest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed them all the way up to the office of security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were directed toward me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my cause when I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed movement is up to this day in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
then again through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I read all the details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably have allocated to me a larger cell this time .
I have to share it with just one more prisoner and I am allowed to sit immediately without waiting for permission .
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the bureaucr@@ at left the cell , and I res@@ or@@ ted to an old @-@ tried method of communication : beating the f@@ ist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first chief &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a prominent middle age man who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , no distinctive facial features can be recognized by me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers den@@ ote his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would leave him if I stay .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row in order to drive all these crow@@ s away from the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from a distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams sound , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of spo@@ iling until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the wheel ( for example : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to 13 S@@ ure of the Quran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was lifted : in order to protect the state security against us and to prevent that we release the tra@@ it@@ or and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played out their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world@@ view .
this is not a house that is not a land here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminal of their cl@@ an into a hero .
I enter the listening room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he seems to me that way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to join those days and protest in demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I can &apos;t say more exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice told me that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to earn that penalty .
on punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er delights in your scre@@ ams .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cri@@ es .
my cri@@ es weren &apos;t enough for him yet , why they exchanged the tube through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had been working as a garbage collector earlier or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present us the , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in line .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t find any favor , which is why he picked up his next to an electrically charged stick .
electricity flow@@ ed all my body , enough to supply my whole quarter .
my semi @-@ naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which happened to me like minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must worry terri@@ bly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move away , you &apos;ll be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he changes to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and back to his couch .
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips patch with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ low@@ labour@@ ers ( e.g. Far@@ mer ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questions their proven opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , Rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all of these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities that reach from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ize with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special a@@ version against the American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; he describes himself , even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so , because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he po@@ urs in water dissolved N@@ es@@ café into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the lo@@ ins speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the wa@@ vy of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially when you look into neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - not to land in prison .
recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o argued that the cultural and traditional norms of the country are contradic@@ tory and the main reason for the concert announcement is .
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former Press spokes@@ persons in the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had just been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation .
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the tried @-@ and @-@ tested legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; who continue to decide &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement probably should not be simple rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an increasingly prominent emerging reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually trust them .
in the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &quot; honorary mor@@ als &quot; - the in@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary mor@@ als reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still more difficult that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been subjected to murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be held in prison for in@@ definite periods of time , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee provided by the family is necessary that the woman will not be able to do anything .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music also enjoys great popularity and is well known for not shy away from topics that long as tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music that is full of explicit all@@ u@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fed up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tackl@@ es the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , one verse often repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which , in his words , &quot; that can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on the equality of LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya in order to remember that his comments were torn out of context , distorted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but only a edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b acqu@@ ires openly for the Arab LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community and believes intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ oro , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ oro , who was later to work on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom , it is nothing new anymore that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service adopted several former members of government and members of the teacher &apos;s association , with the ration@@ ale that they were cri@@ tically related to the problems associated with the corruption in the country on comment@@ aries in social media .
in view of this , the H@@ da@@ i@@ b concert is , according to the opinion , only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a permanent giving and taking . Jordan has now denied Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , deliber@@ ate and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and artificial ways of demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until it is so far , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and consequently resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is presum@@ ed that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the solid cars , drums and dancing have taken over more than one thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west mar@@ ched to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the em@@ bas@@ hi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
for a long time I look at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two celeb@@ ri@@ ties are just to be seen .
yet for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high fixed car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange arms against sh@@ ears and raz@@ ors

external appearance and body care were rare as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth out of crimin@@ ality and promote a legitimate trade like the hair@@ style .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the extraordinary hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has resulted in getting more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the ultimate limits of fantasy and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; competition &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there experts face each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of obtaining bad advice to obtain a training in the hair@@ dressing arts that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children .
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important , people who feel exp@@ elled to accommodate affection ?
precisely this question left the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga of the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os of the Young Youth Foundation , and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la Catal@@ li@@ aci@@ ón ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government closed a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
but in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans there is still a long way to speak about genuine reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who had lived in illegal camps for many years , were subjected to a rhet@@ oric of war and carrying their weapons around the clock , must now re @-@ integrate into their lives as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take it into its ranks and support it in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian believed that young Colum@@ bi@@ ans would join together and would have to help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ as to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - who will then be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation originated at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more need@@ lessly .
he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed most urgently .
thus the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and have to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the area of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on March 19 .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to bring the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC were set up as they had done earlier to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Gar@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty battle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran up to me about the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ g@@ ged him all the way and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was also tired of the war , was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know there is a society outside that wa@@ its for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC joined a discussion group .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC were already in hiding .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organisation , their ide@@ als , and gave insight into their views of the peace process : &quot; for many years we have seen the social injustice done by the State to the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never heard their hearing and had no right to vote , and realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings , who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca camp , wrote the following letter to the Archbishop of Cal@@ i , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i :
Colom@@ bi@@ ans were proph@@ esi@@ ed that peace would reign after dis@@ arm@@ ament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to resort to weapons , raise themselves and protest for their rights . and that is also totally justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call upon all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong to - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman talks about the persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the life before Kad@@ y@@ rov

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ ova and its first publication took place on the OC Media website .
homosex@@ ual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with hor@@ r@@ ors , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs above the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q community there is not about overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ sn@@ y who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published to address the wor@@ sen@@ ing , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Nov@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , who arrested suspi@@ cious men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in gun @-@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ sn@@ y and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the gender balance of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
for fear of her life , she moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a voluntary hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents went through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App the round .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was just going to und@@ o a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but nothing hurt me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you honor the family , you stain ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital .
apparently , some women had everything to get along and started scre@@ aming .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two cuts in my right lung .
OC Media : in which wings were you laid - in which of the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , my male name still stands on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for that .
when I read his name for the first time on his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he respect@@ fully handled with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
I received threats last February .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
they put forward absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by running up above without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gro@@ sn@@ y and say that I had not changed my race that everything was only bad talk , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it became too much for my mother and she lay down a rope around his neck .
fortunately , the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a plate with a 95 on it .
after it had happened for the third time it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without registering me , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother per W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re safe , just because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about gender equality , this is a tab@@ oo subject .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with a camera , I actually try to look like the person she reminds me of her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for him I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has been in gun for one and a half months .
he told that during Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait and he did not lock up a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are gay men now held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine said there weren &apos;t so many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to settle for Kad@@ y@@ rov &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ould they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were deliberately immersed in order to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was det@@ ained in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
he says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their beard grew .
there has been nothing new from them since then .
they just took them away .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was there even when these people were taken away .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports to date . however , we suspect such actions are possible .
why would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think before 2003 I was already known in quite Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally intended to bring us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civilization &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but eventually threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , bore tube je@@ ans and short loops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never bo@@ thered me even a hair .
before the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children , when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace last ?
Sab@@ rina : until Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped onto the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak on television about morality .
he spoke not about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - one could sense how people began to change in the city .
whoever smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , looked at you at once with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I was able to feel the situation in the republic steadily worse .
OC Media : what action do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a sort of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ff , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food types .
I don &apos;t have a cent for it for a long time .
I discovered these people myself when I cl@@ apped the places of refuge .
I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear Hid@@ al@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is sil@@ ly .
so nature is , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make you white with foam before the mouth that there are no bo@@ b@@ bin@@ s with them .
the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ ders have what , the cab@@ ard@@ ines have , the Russians too ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
you know , many think in transit to men who love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different types of feeling to be exact , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know I &apos;m myself now .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months there is a strong increase in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability of his family to come up , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi &apos;s human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he ign@@ ited himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August in the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have imposed .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and pursue a safe work because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , located in the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran , was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to deny its livel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy assumed power , and in 1925 took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little of this wealth .
it is often a victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and priv@@ ations .
the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs working places in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas to the Persian territories where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroy local farming as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi teenagers rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Cooperation , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job had completed primary school , 55 % had completed secondary school and 45 % have university degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist resi@@ ding in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
as officials and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of the national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their homeland .
there are people who had to change their pro@@ s and sur@@ names in order to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and be hired as even Arabic names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone the speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists beat al@@ arms before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world will wake up and take note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
if I say that I am not a female femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - are frustr@@ ated with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all fem@@ inists * inside .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money in spite of equal education than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer double and thre@@ ef@@ old among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I come to speak on skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black women &apos;s women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention what kind of physical , mental and verbal abuse have been ab@@ used , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and to sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to reach equality ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering from domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all people of all skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to consider injustice in her mind , which relate to both gender and skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women again and again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a tri@@ vial and margin@@ alized being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation in order to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program .
I will no longer try to expose white women to the importance of overl@@ apping skin color and gender . because some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them a better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give birth to women of different origins and isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to release myself completely and completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than advoc@@ ating a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism - claims that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .

p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution from To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq in the last 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the UN NGO &quot; Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work lies on persecuted , poor@@ ly respected sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and new multimedia techniques , with whose help supp@@ ressed communities can tell their stories in their own way .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article entitled &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by cur@@ tural . the article is part of the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er , which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become violent against her .
some time had passed since the end of their relationship and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but they could not do any more .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for mal@@ treatment , the exact ad of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez also did not use anything .
a few days later , the second woman retired .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women are fully ref@@ unded , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit being victims of violence must report to the law enforcement agencies .
In@@ halt@@ 1 Stri@@ ke and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible abuse and a judicial system that does not under@@ mine 3 Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , poor implementation blows and statistics
it is hard to see how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says my@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a social scientific research facility in Paraguay . &quot; there are different statements and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the numbers available , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District Prosecutor &apos;s Office opened 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of them were about violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the courts of peace . here again , 86 % of the ads of women came .
in the ads , 40 % of women claimed that they were mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women come who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
in August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of murder in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , every ten days in Paraguay dies a woman because of violence by men .

invisible abuse and a judicial system that does not under@@ mine
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but she gave up . this should be regre@@ t@@ table for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognis@@ able :
I would never have thought that I would once become a victim of abuse .
when I read about it , I always thought that it happened only to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos myself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that consists of women , all of whom are victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victoria &apos;s case everything started with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , they did not receive support .
she carried out a process against her former partner who developed into an im@@ penet@@ r@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good base , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the abuse of ab@@ uses is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # für@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ invasive ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to declare fem@@ or@@ isation a perpet@@ ual criminal record and punish har@@ sh@@ er as it is already the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , in some respects , the law text was changed in order to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is denied , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and punished with up to five years in prison .
the original bill had intended to cost the bulk of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs which the victims of violence have to carry even if they simply want to pay an adver@@ t and would like to receive a secure accommodation to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , abuse is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here a re@@ think must take place so that violence is no longer considered a normal thing .
anyone who is silent in the face of these facts is complic@@ it and contributes to the perpetr@@ ators of offen@@ se .
we must reimbur@@ se for such a long time until mal@@ treatment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate , but parts of the law had been modified before , including a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence had called for reconciliation .
opinions on the changes go apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack its victims again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back .

independent media continues to attack attacks in Oman one year after a newspaper banned
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the om@@ anic authorities concluded the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in jail , serving a year @-@ old prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried again later .
since 1970 , Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after completing his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the chief ministers in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the sul@@ tan &apos;s rule is characterized by the insist@@ ence of the security forces , in particular domestic intelligence , restric@@ ting public liber@@ ties , including press freedom , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists to intim@@ id@@ ate and det@@ ain independent journalists .
the authorities systematically restrict and prevent peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights , including activists , to express their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n paper , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking Parties to the Justice of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; it was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and interference by high @-@ ranking officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of putting pressure on the Supreme Court of Oman by imposing judgment on an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was loaded from ISS to the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS finds Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the minister of information had given the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , banned from 9 August 2016 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and al @-@ Abr@@ i took place before the court in Mas@@ k@@ at .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condemned , among other things , for a distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot;
in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a prohibition of publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three year prison terms and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the distribution of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a ref@@ und@@ able deposit of $ 13@@ ,000 was established and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the pron@@ ounc@@ ement of the sentence .
the App@@ eals Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month custo@@ dial sentence from the prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to be in prison , serving his prison sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the App@@ eals Court also highlighted the decision by the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the court &apos;s decision to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper still faces attacks by the Brazilian government .
on 8 January , the minister of information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed another statement , in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , with which the minister once again challenged the decision of the App@@ eals Court to re@@ install the publication of the paper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated in Oman .
further violations include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Korean authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and unconditional ;
2. to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n paper so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman asser@@ t their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in bor@@ dering states by promoting freedom of expression and association , as well as the right to peac@@ efully gather , support and protect them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area addressed to one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment in research into these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists helps build up own research capacities in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious effects on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the S@@ event@@ h Health System .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ laim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GV : what do you think are the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no fundamental research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain a recipient instead of being a leader himself .
the solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where is financing and support coming from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported in different ways .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what &apos;s the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic education , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise , which poses challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the USA to India : how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed producers change global food production &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by its own imagination and the question of how many types of salads he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding .
the patents were not only used for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cur@@ led leaves .
in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ el varieties . due to these trends , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts in food security care about the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still breeding a salad , but it takes longer because his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more limitations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if in a river a b@@ oul@@ der is lying around which I must go down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go too far on salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot; he makes it as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics that he wants .
however , he is very careful and tries not to use any material protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the U.S. and all over the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Roman sal@@ at in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station , where it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds as if the movement comes from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for Open @-@ Source &quot; seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant bree@@ ders .
within the framework of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bree@@ ders can undertake to freely use the seed bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others who buy seeds to breed their own varieties , and not immediately sow - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
for the accredited professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the opportunity to grow new plants is important for food security and environmental protection .
according to him , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultiv@@ ating seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not deal with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grains , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says and takes on the increasingly common amal@@ gam@@ ations of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , which , for example , are offered on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetables are bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative commit themselves to making other seeds available free of charge . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in his PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . it found that about one @-@ third of all the car@@ rot characteristics are protected as intellectual property , making it suitable for plant bree@@ ders either not at all or only difficult to use .
for other plants , such estimates do not yet exist , but experts such as Lu@@ by suspect that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or car@@ rots .
a Mat@@ ter of Visi@@ ons
plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those by which their taste or color improves to such , because of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for bree@@ ders takes more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before , as the changed conditions are much worse than ever due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to recognis@@ es that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the notion that intellectual property can restrict other bree@@ ders as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees this differently : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly won &apos;t support innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have already lost the fight .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and it should remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want farmers to make their work easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Mor@@ ton is interfer@@ ing with the concept of pat@@ enting plant features : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form them themselves and as bree@@ ders we finally have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Caro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety breeds his own values in them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation are needed mass @-@ wise her@@ bi@@ cides , grow into its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( those who move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) have patents , most of the smaller seed companies can survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ ton believes that bree@@ ders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I always need new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a patent , it is protected for 20 years ahead of competition , which makes it very easy to believe in my opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the USA seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , uses a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed programme . to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the Centre works with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organization Agre@@ col pursu@@ es an Open Source License , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bree@@ ders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , which is why the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , states that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office which permits patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patents pat@@ enting seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for Open Source seed systems for which the official starting signal will be scheduled for next year .
a merger of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report on the future of food - a network of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection from the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes that soon more people will soon be recognized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has taken particular attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock up content on the internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August , the network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities sharply critici@@ zed and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains true - despite this attack and the ridi@@ cu@@ le of Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 web sites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the network of Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era from Qatar due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that he writes for websites and media not accessible in Egypt .
now the blog he set up was to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , even the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider in which also Zi@@ adas blog is given , on the other hand , is more accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video how the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him :
blocking blo@@ gs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though the blo@@ c of the blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is nevertheless for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , attempted murder , discharge at the National Security Council , blocking blo@@ gs as well as any other web site for which I worked .
2 ) They proved that I didn &apos;t write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to avoid cens@@ orship .
but now , after blocking it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the cour@@ a@@ geous walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the block@@ age of providers that was possible through the circum@@ vention of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offered began .
such practice suggests the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content that Egyptian users could have access to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which they can proceed to court for these acts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

newspapers all over Brazil day after day , with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bed the pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the Army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the 2017 violence threshold reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these are com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on 16 August published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which it announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ating from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ruin in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for In@@ ner Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 territories that are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to disgu@@ ise the atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues against the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to account for those responsible for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ pleasing negl@@ ect of the public service .
reminder : the State of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in the State of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the mor@@ ades per state , Rio is in No@@ .@@ 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been empha@@ sizing the security policy of the state for years .
these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit established by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police operation and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decline of violent death cases . however , after several years , the U@@ PP has increasingly been bombar@@ ded by har@@ ass@@ ments and repres@@ sions against the poor communities , which should protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles in 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for people .
this requires the state to use means and means that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio are still suffering .
a week ago , the police cleared the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the ensu@@ ing civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to World@@ watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b .
the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 , was particularly affected by hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel areas have been besieg@@ ed by rebel areas outside Damascus , which led to local populations being dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to AF@@ P , the French news agency :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can be planted in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that for three years it has been campaig@@ ning for announc@@ ing this project and expressed its relief that it gains more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awareness &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do is used in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of the cultivation of mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la leads to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue collecting donations to Can@@ do by Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80 % .
due to the shortage of fuel , locally produced plastic fuel is used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before they check their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom court in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tank . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms throughout East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach humans the fung@@ us breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break @-@ up of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source in the market .
spreading a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ due ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cart@@ on , etc ) for the production of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities which are tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege becomes visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis regions and help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand fair@@ ness for the victims of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many suburbs in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were r@@ amp@@ ant in the North of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two persons died and some 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the last week the government called out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
bran@@ dies were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite ima@@ gery , about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts .

numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why the civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al of the Federation of the Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open streets surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits will be questioned in places with a high risk of fire .
a far @-@ reaching proposal for the reform of the forest , which the government had submitted for serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law that allowed the construction activity from case to case if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val res@@ ig@@ ns in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of light @-@ combus@@ tible wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , spread continuously after fires of this kind .
to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on the 15th and 16th of October , when inhabitants sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was thus crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits .
even the founder asked for help :

the way from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan by the Tali@@ ban began .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair .
right at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the Haz@@ ara ethnic group , sat together in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Tali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt hel@@ pless .
the Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred for Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ pen found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal pit . the work was hard and made him sick .
then he took what was left of its low wage , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than himself to earn his living .
at that time , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services and no heating . we hung nylon outside the open windows so that we did not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without documents in Iran and was ready to travel to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ pen came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid patients twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high demand rates , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is also true that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in the country are disa@@ strous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; they are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - what can be drawn up for months after the application has been registered .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his ir@@ repres@@ sible tw@@ ins helped A@@ shar@@ pen to get rid of these conditions soon .
after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af had his entire savings in the creation of a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick bite .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian lux@@ uries - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some Afgh@@ ans operated companies , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pa@@ dua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s aims , however , extend far beyond the Italian gastronomy and retail trade and aim to return to the country that he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have the same possibilities as all others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also forged plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of a successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
N@@ eti@@ zen report : accus@@ ations from Egypt allow for the elimination of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported on the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the suspension of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys N@@ eti@@ zen report is an international snapshot showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in worldwide internet rights
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a bill which fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users must register to use social networks within six months of the submission of the law on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number .
those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment or the final settlement of a pen@@ al payment .
the law , which was promoted by sixty members of Parliament , is currently in front of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another member of the Board of Dep@@ u@@ ties filed a legislative proposal that would introduce har@@ sh@@ er pun@@ ish@@ ments for the insul@@ t of the President or a high official .
under Egyptian law , the off@@ ence of the President and state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . under the legislative proposal , such a crime would , however , be punished with prison and fin@@ es , so legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is approved , this can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned .
in addition , this would under@@ mine a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of violence against prot@@ esters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 prot@@ esters , who had been arrested in the same incident four years in custody for a court date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison war@@ ding failed to bring the accused to the cour@@ t@@ room in prison , according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to a so many human rights groups , including arms ownership , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iz@@ a released the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists inter@@ ro@@ gated with scanned documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly inter@@ ro@@ gated on an action plan backed out by the President of the Republic , which , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would ensure business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption official am@@ ne@@ sty if they return all un@@ lawful funds .
the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on 21 April casts a light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources by stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which journalists are entitled to protect their sources .
nevertheless he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 0@@ 9th May as a witness .
does China want to force the users of social media to submit their ID ?
according to the new regulations of the Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media .
it is also stated in the provisions that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts suggest that the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within the social networks is to be achieved . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to en@@ force these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat ? &quot;
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ comm@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of the distribution of information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and to force them upon request for suspension of user data .
these web pages include websites such as V@@ Cont@@ acts and Od@@ no@@ ver@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .@@ R@@ u and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has block@@ age Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia ad@@ mins refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication has announced that the site was closed because it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that co@@ operates with groups to add a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the site . it is , among others , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain can &apos;t stop to sni@@ ff
following this week of le@@ aked documents , Britain &apos;s government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install Backdoor programs that dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services concerning the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
