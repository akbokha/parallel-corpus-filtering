<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter, who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous plot of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I was, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how to deal with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his opinion he never stops behind the mountain, as you say so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections was the highest number ever obtained by the party nominated Candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalism program, which receives people from all over the world, a deeply believer man with whom I was able to talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps Weltanschauung, too, did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "Bhatia and I met with our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the" "" "Phoenix Suns" "" "during the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who struggled for life long for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump secured his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, presidency a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is superficial and respectful and interprets an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to lift up a man who looks upon those looking at those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Ü): as much as "Rising the Whites against all other ethnicities"; word game from white in reference to the white and whiplash, as the great Van Jones called, has killed exactly what America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its President, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he says himself, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the election Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the White Americas that promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "No!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone who is not like you, have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is Trumps Land now, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart to me.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome them with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a coincidental encounter with a French pilot, who launched a musical project and offered a rare hope of hope to the youth.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the buzz you learn day by day trumpets, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments, consisting of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chávez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments imitate violin, viola, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion all produced from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire encompasses classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local economist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a trash-made violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world generates about one billion tons of waste.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and him are the poorest - like people in Cateurura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring performance from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can effectively combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports specifically about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content together.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated in Liberia's waters illegal fishing, before the other coast of Africa visited it.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly enraged and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilizing against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishery authority. he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the region's waters: it was not possible for him to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million dollars in Liberia, because of the plundering of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was founded FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that had expelled the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and help each other where illegal fishing is concerned," "" "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending Illegal Food. this project offers technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected can damage the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once impeded by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail empo, with the information circulated between individual countries, the actions happen nowadays in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also tracks the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open seas via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible for the authorities to flag ships that are fishing in prohibited areas. also, suspicious traffic routes can be discovered - for example those who indicate that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations may show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can then deny the adoption of such ships in their ports based on this information, which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the PM.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there are substantial financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is financially not worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and this is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm campaigning for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to regain estimated 20 million USD of lost revenues, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose each year because of illegal fishermen who enter East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices, among other things, include actions such as sailing under false flag, bogus license papers, specification of fantasy names, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature conservation areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-fully organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" "" "You can't run my port" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front will work.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspect vessels.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has exposed criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "and that's what we try to cross," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO that also deals with fishing data and offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, switch off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is supposed to help FISH-i find criminal acts with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform, together with Google and the marine conservation organization Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data and which can be used to display the position of each trackable vessel around the world.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "gather together with neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing where - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are indications that FISH-i's activities do not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that formerly confiscated without license and hardly expected to face consequences, now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i meanwhile have a 33% increase in fishing revenue, since fisher boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets on board, whose use is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015, six countries joined forces to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "" "Security is the goal of bringing even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's latest member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October, it represented Greko 1, a ship flying under false flag. and not only the ship was also on the road without a license and were used towing nets that are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship had also entered forbidden waters, which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "by taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going on against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the oceans.

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the impeachment of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the proposal of the opposition to a referendum on the impeachment of the government, the Venezuelans, whose eyes were negotiating the political and economic crisis of the country, responded by gathering in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the transfer of Venezuela) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also be held in other parts of the country, including in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andean regions of Mérida and Táchira, in the central north-eastern federal state of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country continues to deteriorate, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans with an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the impeachment of the current President Nicolás Maduro. ultimately, however, the holding of a new election by the official authorities was blocked.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, Contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis in which inflation and winning margins are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum on behalf of many as the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The voting alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or shortly MUD (about: round Table of the Democratic Unity), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together, called on the demonstrators to take part in the support of the National Assembly on 27 October. in addition, a twelve hour strike on the following day and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government headquarters, should continue to block the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among others, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3rd all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="178">There the demonstrators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own testimony against the police and armed proponents of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country some demonstrators tried to stop the police forces, including this woman in the Andean State Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira do not wear skirts because otherwise you could see something that many National Guards did not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic accounts for the round, which is the extent of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the call for an impeachment procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road.</seg>
<seg id="185">Myteks Media Labs:</seg>
<seg id="186">Nicolás and Diosdado say that 1% of the signatures are counterfeit.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here is your impeachment!</seg>

<seg id="189">Others consider these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government which, from their point of view, has taken little against the disastrous economic crisis, and rather has been preoccupied with concealing critical voices:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">The marches are increasing in frequency and intensity.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview conducted by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 in Día a Día, an Argentinian news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take part in the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano has now testified in the context of the great La Perla Ribera process in the province of Córdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, was examined for crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father, up to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the secret of family secrets.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child at the age of 15, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At the time, I could not realise that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis has no choice: his father, Luis Alberto Quijano, was a gendarmerie. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the secret service division 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archive of events.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who was accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quixos's son, a man who recognized the extent of the atrocities he had experienced as a boy over the years and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From sports hall to military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">They all called him "Kent."</seg>

<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the base of the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>

<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he told me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, television, fridges - everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">All of this was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver in it.</seg>
<seg id="235">That day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were turned off and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>

<seg id="238">I looked inside and saw a couch being tortured on the people.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied up there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They seldom attached a man with cuffs to the bed, overthrew him with water, and chased him a charge of 220 volts in the genitals.</seg>

<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a Kyotos inhabitant. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily Kyoto Shimbun, which is published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "" "said Holmes." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The wrong English translation was first removed. the name "terrible drivers" was later replaced by the more appropriate, although grammatically not quite correct designation "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported the following about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we sincerely regret that elderly people felt insulted by the inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News was somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "awful" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police, the share of older motorists who are involved in accidents throughout the country is quite a cause of concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Prefecture of Kyoto, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors caused 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translation you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills in order to transfer it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally speaking, the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers in the target language.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French, not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies don't employ English as their native language, who could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of native English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees, can still make translations in-house. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The proverted and enigmatic sentences that arise through machine translation show that this technology cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this applies especially to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious prints that often decorate shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may still be acceptable or at least harmless. but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, it is possible to expect more careful translation.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the Kyoto City will hopefully use a more reliable source for their translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Naval con Libertad" (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vivoplay online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Other users later wrote that the internet sites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also carried photos of the protests in Caracas organized by oppositional groups opposing the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">Protests began in early April after the Supreme Court disbanded the parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was appalled and recommended to use VPN (virtual private networks) to access the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zensur: activate your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems Venezuelan providers are locked up again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers like Vivoplay are popular among the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitant since 2014 when reporting protests. at that time, the Telecommunications Commission threatened them with fines and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfilmic later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the domain name system (DNS), but also two more online broadcasters. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transmits its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier investigations of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to requests from certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If an Internet site is blocked by the DNS, the server replies erroneous or denies the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">VPITV, a third locked channel, was suspended on Thursday, 6 April, when VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who recorded the protests in Caracas live, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also reported that the government regulates Internet connections, making it more difficult for the Venezuelans to access multimedia reporting on current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen," which is edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "she said." "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she became ten years old she began to work as a criadita for the family. in Paraguay the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money passes their underage son or their underage daughter to another, more rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof above the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to pay innumerable days of housework, which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice described as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay due to its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which is vaccinated against the Crimeans guarantees in general silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, who is their daughter in the belief that they complete their education, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves" to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who receives the girl in her and justifies her exploitation by believing that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise not receive education and might even be starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>

<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed vestiges of violent strokes.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military hospital Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an officer in the registration office.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira surrendered to Marín as long as she suffered lethal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela were responsible for the practice of Criadazgo deep in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">"" "they called the Criadazgo as" "" "a modern form of slavery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be no other Carolina in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"" "" "" "in Paraguay more cows are registered than children," "" "said Tina Alvarenga." ""</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to offend the rights of children unpunished.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a prompt investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>

<seg id="455">The Criaditas are exploited not only as labour forces, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción in Crimean.</seg>
<seg id="460">Alvarenga worked in the house of her employers between four and six hours each day.</seg>

<seg id="465">The more she was done with learning the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve but also did not get unlimited food. "I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">In some evenings the landlord Alvarenga forced him to stand next to him and to read editorial from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to persuade them to not give faith to the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>

<seg id="473">Her gentleman was afraid that she would lose the education she had enabled her to lose again, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">But it was quite clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Even at school Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never talked about is bullying and the harassment that Criaditas are exposed to when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anybody to me home. I didn't have a friend in the school or in the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="497">In the course of our history we managed to abolish systems such as slavery, Cuñadazgo (a practice from the Early History of Paraguay), the Conquistadores, the women of Guaraní, and the system of Mensú (where the workers were considered to be semi-slaves), and the native population was willing to support them in a system of slavery, in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from the Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still occupied the region with its reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for northeastern Japan, documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" in March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. the Prefecture of Miyagi was one of the prefectures in Japan's northeast that had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, as the tsunami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima prefecture was still experiencing a nuclear accident, and alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view what progress has been achieved six years after, in order to rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those affected.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare-houses were completed in the Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures was reported by Miyagi, where 80 per cent of the planned spare-houses were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light at 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the catastrophe, Evacuated von Behel's shelters (mugages, casetsu jusutaku) have to be relocated to final spare-houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple disaster, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuees from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuees that met after disaster in homes were resettled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by disaster have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of fishery ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident have largely affected agricultural land in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 per cent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agriculture can be used again in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land from Fukushima lie in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures tourism has largely recovered, but also here Fukushima remains far away.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 per cent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwellers are more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to obtain an overall picture, the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and the evacuation. she asked her about the status of the reconstruction and also, how her feelings about the tsunami risk have changed.</seg>
<seg id="571">In their introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to find out more about the tsunami awareness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents had taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents found that still not enough was done in the field of catastrophes prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As for those who had to evacuate from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition to commemorate the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper increased its attention to the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also a witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160 000 evacuation from Fukushima, almost 63 thousand people were transferred to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 a little more than 23,000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent spare-houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">At the end of 2017, some 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuated ones who still live in Behel-shelters are older than 50 years old. they are well known because the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima are competing with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The folk community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the Western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities were paralyzed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After firing the sugar cane industry in the region stood still, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the framework of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, rising every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive time are in operation because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers exactly that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">A few decades ago, the news would have been a subject of concern for the country, but the bad harvests are no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality had already seen better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The crushing of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that can produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar will remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Food and Food Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar exports would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>

<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people, received their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "when Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is" "" "scam." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of closing, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially recorded documents which differed only with regard to the parts that would be removed, addressing the address and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was covered and the letters came more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the closed factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, is waiting for retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the decommissioning of the factory in which he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 working years.</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or rather, when they began to tone it off, they also stopped to asphalate the road, this disadvantaged even other farms.</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations young people use Hip-Hop to express themselves and get their own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">A song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo taken with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do it through Hip-Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been teaching mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then together with the Cree Hip-Hop-Group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop concludes that the young participants discuss topics like "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance," or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the KitSumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, relates the history of Highway 16, also called "Highway of Tears," a street section in Western Canada where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unenlightened.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people do not always speak native languages to the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation have recorded, the chorus is sung at Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly of the Northstars hip-hop group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript, as well a translation into English translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and also move forward in our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what they intended for the Creator.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, are located near the entrance to shokuhin sanpuru (for painting, "" "" plastic models of dishes "" "") of any dish that is served in this restaurant. "" "</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see themselves in these plastic dishes and decide whether they can enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">There are a large number of these small companies in the tokier district of Kappabashi that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend is turning them into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the Blogger itinii series of social media links and photos published this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new plastic ribbons decorated with plastic ribbons as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin coolants magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essences is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we have found a good use as a mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now can I decorate my mobile with laughing?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic courts can also take on a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasantly.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and wristbands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other bizarre plastic dishes can be found at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry. for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the grieving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind every corpse, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with drug trafficking"), which aims to give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who were involved in the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>

<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with illness and sensing journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass newspaper kiosks every day and see the titles with images that actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he wants Narco (German: drug traffickers) if he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me this is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of humans is incredible for me, if the death of six people and the enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by making them" "" "obsessive" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they remain spared from such tragedies when they do not stir and remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of blackmail in the capital district: how a family was sacked with threats." it describes how armed criminals squeezed money from their business month after month, until they end not only destroyed the business, but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain about it never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days whether crying would dissolve my deep-rooted sentiments, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless saying that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, cook potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody body of his father, who was shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez really looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as a result of the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the citizens' council for public security and government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor called 3103 Morde. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 morals per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed combat against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country over the past four decades in an understandable way.</seg>

<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been misleading to portray tragedies that have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tank truck crossed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died there.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the roads in the region have become dangerous paths filled with potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank truck fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Official representatives described a fireball, which enveloped dozens of houses, including a cinema nearby, which was full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses routed and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burnt to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture titled "That is Nigeria." by the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident depict the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are strung on the floor while persons watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story doesn't end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo has been recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses drastically reported atrocities that they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "nobody stayed behind to count corpses," "" "said a Human Rights Watch resident." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only by satellite images the follow-up time could be depicted.</seg>
<seg id="844">The attack was also unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo as it was wrongly presented as proof of the fact and scope of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this improper use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of misconceptions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further brings personal comments like this, wrongly, the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media related to the supply of arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture taken from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash report published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee could strike blows, rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported of the violence against Rohingya, posts appeared as follows, who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page, which in 2012 falsely claimed that Myanmar's Than Being said that monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and Pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions on silence related to the murders of Christians by Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question is, however, what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are a lot of people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">This mood of false and false information suggests that actual atrocities are untrue and embellish the real horror of what actually happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the retention of images of refusal is equivalent to recognising the tragedy. sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images are desensitizing readers and viewers and they have the ability to feel empathy (such as this study investigating how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used from context or completely improper nature.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name of untranslatable (e.g. insurmountable) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to be translated at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these insurmountable words are well known today (like the famous Portuguese sour dades) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example, the Spanish Sobota).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone stubbornly resist any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or phrase is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from the Tap-clap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- tiring around your parents in recognition of the way around you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrrics language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "" "" "kwadi" "" "- the comfort or laziness that one feels after being warmed in the sun on cold days." ""</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his Blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They devise other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site want to publish even more of these "insurmountable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="970">The island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and landslide catastrophe in this decade.</seg>
<seg id="971">Triggered by the monsoon, which normally sets in at the end of May, the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilwala and Attanagalu Oya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country have stepped over the banks.</seg>
<seg id="972">After a statement by the catastrophe center of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017, 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and sludge.</seg>
<seg id="973">Over 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe locations.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rain falls on Saturday (May 27), and the water levels in some areas slowly went back.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster:</seg>
<seg id="977">High water in Tawalama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users such as Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet deliver regular updates to flood situation.</seg>
<seg id="978">Many use the hashtag # FloodSL to monitor the extent of the disaster.</seg>

<seg id="980">This morning the Neluwa bus stood in high water, water level up to 6 meters. village of Moragoda near Galle also flooded because of the water pegels of the Morogoda Ela.</seg>
<seg id="981">The Air Force provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five were completed for the transport of emergency deliveries to the residents included in their flooded villages.</seg>
<seg id="982">Various organizations and startups have also agreed to help.</seg>
<seg id="983">Facebook pages such as Help Flood Victims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Disaster Relief - Information Desk- Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian assistance.</seg>
<seg id="984">If any search and rescue teams require drones for their operations, please call the number 0774844639.</seg>
<seg id="985">For those who want to donate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -</seg>
<seg id="986">Today we are in the area around Kelyya and Himbutana.</seg>
<seg id="987">Please call the number 0777449729 or 0777843841, if you need help in this area.</seg>
<seg id="988">The taxi call-App PickMe (Sri Lanka) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Katastophenzentrum is informed.</seg>
<seg id="989">Last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Roanu, PickMe introduced a "flood aid" button that allowed users to call a vehicle for pick-up assistance and donations. they were then forwarded to the Sri Lankan Red Cross free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="990">They also launched an "SOS" button, which resulted in more than one thousand requests and 150 successful boat retalizations for flooding and landslides.</seg>
<seg id="991">The combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka, where several social media platforms are fully exploited, bring people in need of security and provide assistance.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language storytelling initiative (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the insurmountable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States where TLS has held events since 2015, there is a risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where people don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening is often connected with it," "" "these events are" "" "used" "" "instead," "" "listening, to appreciate, to make sense." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format storytellers first introduce their history in their own language and then translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and representation lead to the fact that the audience gets involved.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this turn, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nytrara tells the fables of the rabbit and the Baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his fable, John Nyamara is asked: "how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were completely with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Until now the events of Treasure Language storytelling have taken place in three cities and the organizers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017. the March started with the Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Civil Front for the Neural Review of Debt) and the ecumenical church meeting in Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the re-determination of debt have also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ricos demand that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debt can be held accountable for their corruption.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is hosted in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a researcher in the France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director at Book Sprints, a publishing house published by so-called 'Book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and is available here license-free contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what the real costs associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and make sense of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the list of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that pushes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, right away.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of sometimes extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activists has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the military police had taken Bassel as a "strictly secret" command of the military court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad administration and notified them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His place of residence and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes was more predictive than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the world's most important archaeological sites, was the cross of numerous civilizations, and here the Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he started working with the work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This campaign in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel gave me English even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a commission that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together for a year together on the book.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It happens":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens at every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That each of the dangers does not matter to me,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, shackles and guards</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the throng of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I enter into every detail of your voice and words</seg>
<seg id="1235">Which I carry with passion with me,</seg>
<seg id="1236">When your eyes say goodbye</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I quickly return to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To take back all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And about your absence to cry and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I convince myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of Bassel's imprisonment, Ghazi wrote:</seg>
<seg id="1243">One year passes, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">During the period of time</seg>
<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you are still in the cage of monsters</seg>
<seg id="1247">Its history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime Bashar al-Assads, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">According to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians have died in prison until 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we reiterate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: Director, convicted of corruption, returning to previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambians responded with anger on a corruption case where a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state machine after half of his prison sentence where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants on account of violations of 54 million Metikas (about 800 000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from Mozambique's airports, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his return to the company, which happened on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the application, there would be no reason for Cambaza to return to his old position, as the company did not execute any disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">But many inhabitants don't like the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integrida Pública, CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">"" "" "" "what we take note is that the company should also introduce a disciplinary action against the contrary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently remained silent and did not initiate appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a major voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "" "unwardly" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after being sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">To the contrary!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director does not have any moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already so massively insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morality and serves to serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead has only served themselves by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief belongs to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel not only to remember the Mozambique as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, one-edged and - by the way - prophetic orator.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral portrayals was when he vigorously affirmed that "an ambitious human being is able to sell also the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not that way. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "" "" "an ambitious human being is criminal at the same time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also negative:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat for 10 years and was free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today, the company, with which he resigns money, is under contract again. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - яαStandardizczyk (@ azmal _ Rafik) May 12, 2017</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chick peas or fissures.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took its posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "lovingly" "" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word commonly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word have been censored in order to express their use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with fundamental meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spacbse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboofutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a spiritual way, if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - very similar to racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook ought to be more analytical before releasing all posts that were suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on Factook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What should be done instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech have received a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to anyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... as I became aware of this new Facebook policy, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours, because the mail didn't correspond to the Facebook community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply trying to show their opinions against the hate speeches of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet Community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "peas curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "" "" "Facebooks automatic censorship provided a lot of ridicule among users." ""</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun via Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech but still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to check out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post says" "" "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, the hate language in social networks is to boost the violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has criticised for his failure to bring out the balancing hate speech on his Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at the context rather than focusing on code-concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1347">The UN statistics for 2002-2012 show that the share of children who were married to 15 were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the statistical centre office of the country confirmed that between 1997 and 2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements aimed at abolishing the laws of childbirth followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this result.</seg>

<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition provided tensions in this actually uncomplicated situation, and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But early 2017, the draft law against the infant was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be announced." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the senators of the country gave a status update on Facebook, which once again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the infant was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for that and not one vote against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After being decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users were thrilled, because the laws of childbirth have finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a ministerial post in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">There has been too much time and unnecessary talk that has veiled the core of the matter, but do you know what? the infant is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth almost every price.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page in English was shown on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based on the crowdsourcing principle for more than a month.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day becomes more clear how important the platform is for users to find and share useful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series oppose the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technicased Internet users are used to using conversion tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia, as recently described in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet since 2007 are held after the internet law (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, several mirror sites (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are often updated) have now appeared.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (thus machine-calculator connections) which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available, however, in spite of legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS tells about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we all started to take snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents in a decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it was merely a screenshot and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopeditions, a MirrorPage of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirror sites when locked in each country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and employees at mozilla at Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">There is no complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL that is not the original. that which you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server transfers the request to the right Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo of Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motives and balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to wear a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar decided to bring Nepal animal world onto the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-rate situation helps him:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to kindle pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he ought to know [it], for he was already facing tigers face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger is not disturbed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the Buzhek appeared. he immediately sat down, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Neptune's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to make recordings of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could shoot a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This article was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women with great care avoid speaking the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronoun or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit they respect the husband because of social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, maintain this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a bogus court and cast off by her family and the village community after having responded to a married family with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of not naming their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer rights to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, entered a unique club and became the main topic in the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs there are in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is operated by the Video Volunteers community and campaigned for the mining of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1479">For seven years, Rohini Pawas has been working with her video camera to cover practices such as infant's marriage and the exile of HIV and AIDS and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She tells how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors for change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in its discussion was of women who did not name their husbands in their name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open up the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not saying loudly the names of their husbands is a custom that they have all duly maintained and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini believes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not stop this is seen as a deceitful woman, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband on behalf of her husband, wanted to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on by his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini launched its first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini requested every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked," "" "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does that mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Paz from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on breaking a centuries-old tradition, in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was chuckled just in front of her; another decided to leave all the frustrated frustrations against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the rush of adrenaline about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands in their name at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">During the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put into the head of women: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A student of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead indicating the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinnoberred dot if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped bearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped working, but they think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip at every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry who could hear what" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their birthdays with cake for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things, such as our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things loudly, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have carried only saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, that's okay, but some wanted to wear a Saline-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, the morals associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of curtas (overshirts) into a discussion round so that women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and raw ini is sure they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question as to whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only taken small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped saying the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred at any time on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as violating more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - are at the end of a hard-to-navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they realise that they sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1549">On June 29 this year, the hashtag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend, where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is considered to be a turning point in the Japanese culture of the postwar period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles in 1964 in London, noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here have become quite clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," said Ryuichi Isaka, President of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! for today the Beatles memorial day is in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Also today songs are sung by the Beatles in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The kitsch of the Beatles is just surviving everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll should be John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese of course also make pilgrimages to the known places connected with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In case you love the Beatles, this is your 5 places you absolutely have to visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>

<seg id="1568">5. (from the link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">The pilgrimages can sometimes not be whimsical enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in 1966, the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the film K-On! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran through Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">The same thing we did last year.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course, some companies also use the fan community for market-related reasons, such as this Ramen shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen!</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could that be for a day?</seg>
<seg id="1578">"" "today I will listen to" "" "Yesterday" "" "and eat Ramen noodles at Mutaro Koya." ""</seg>

<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milanange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was decapitated and part of the organs had been taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently, the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">It would give the local superstitions that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC declared.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the target of murders for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN in South Africa conducted a mission in South Africa to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Millau, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Husky Algy Adamo, student and residents of the town of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police had already followed the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the deaths of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, for presumably superstitious rituals, has given cultural motifs and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a faith existed, according to which the victims were in the head of power generating wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1601">During the last days three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">On Facebook, Angela Ferreira Samantha shared the chronicle of the Bloggers poor Snaippa, who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÖCHTE GERNE EIN Mozambique, THE SME is ashamed to go to the street where people would be ashamed to have sex against good notes, work and other achievements, a nation in which people would be honest pursuits, or even take their lives to earn their bread, a country in which neither the Albinos nor bald or bald are hunted for superstitious purposes or "black magic."</seg>

<seg id="1612">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria, actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel Khartabil (also known as Bassel Safadi) took a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="1613">He was a close friend of many of the Global Voices community and took part in our Arab blogger meeting in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="1614">In November 2015, Bassel's wife Noura Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by persons who spent themselves as insiders of the Assad government.</seg>
<seg id="1615">They reported that their husband was sentenced to death but did not give any further information.</seg>
<seg id="1616">Bastia's stay and constitution were unknown until today (01 August 2017) when Noura heard of Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1617">Today and in the future, Bassel's work as a pioneer of the open web movement will be the honor.</seg>
<seg id="1618">And we appreciate the efforts of all the individuals and organisations that have been campaigning for his release in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bashar al-Assad's regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared, including the Syrian Network for Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Innumerable of those arrested or forcibly displaced by the regime are subjected to torture and even executions.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his attorney announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized for liver cancer at the end of June.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion," following the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Liu case as" "" "an internal affair" "" "and a spokesman relates that he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or allow him a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some foreign reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations, United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu abroad to have a treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway Finns for Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was stalled after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Liu although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China since exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was not able to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union - European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Liu as she announced in an explanation on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Lius's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokesperson for the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced on 27 June that the news agency AFP announced that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to free his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the US embassy's call came to an angry response from China, with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and to make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley said that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice, to which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing news agency Reuters that China had great concerns as to whether the vortex around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada and Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum China called on Liu to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak with someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release the rights for exercising these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France - France</seg>
<seg id="1669">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France called on China to release Liu on humanitarian grounds on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures have to be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan Floor Vacation Rentals</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of landmarks in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Liu and show greater tolerance towards those who are using peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese lawgiver Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama - The Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned in an explanation on 28 June around Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Liu Well being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or Country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 domain Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked if New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, one hears that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very posable: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries," in view of which he appeared inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old Lyre appears again from authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the responses to his American guests in the last week of Shanmugam were really non-answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicative, our political system.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He camouflaged appropriate questions with non-rational art.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng challenges Shanmugam to clarify his opinion since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to what country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clear this point as long as he was paid up to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his comment on the blog, he points out reviews about the criticism that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections were so uneasy even if we enjoy free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore" "" "is not a country," "" "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who, as the leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"" "" "" "I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said very embarrassed..." ""</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what I expected - be I with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes he is right and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review departs the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Herr Shanmugam" "" "faithfully commit a mistake" "" "or was it a joy of joy?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, Mr. Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the Singaporean do their military service, do they defend only their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our Prime Minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">The magazine Journey of a Decade is tending to Bejahung, Singapore and was always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I did not say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>

<seg id="1740">Their answers will be published here as part of a continuous series, with rumours about certain parts of the world exposed and another facet is to be presented.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest installment of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>

<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">My clarification usually follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature." many Canadians perhaps cook inside rage when they are held for Americans, but that doesn't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag well visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All dear Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans, on the other hand,....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - ahead of Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>

<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">"" "but there are also some problems with the stamp" "" "nice" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1768">First: to be called "nice" means basically to be spaciously - just like the benevolent, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (who has his own Canadian double-Doppelgänger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada were really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "cute" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means being unobtrusive and uninteresting and not paying attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">It can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from things happening around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">"" "what outsiders call" "" "nice" "" "is perhaps just cool politeness." ""</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians do not often talk about the fence with the neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm, open kindness which I now connect with my American friends.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band famous in Thailand has released a music video that is paroding the junta, which took power in 2014 and despite its promise to restore the civilian government, the country continues to rule.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the prescriptions of his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not politically, the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>

<seg id="1786">"" "last month the Charlie Chaplin video" "" "The Dictator" "" "in Thailand was even blocked after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video." ""</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, in particular as it relates to the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video, which relate to some of the political issues which Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 Rules of the Girls" "" "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the preliminary Constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the army absolute decision-making on important national issues." ""</seg>

<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often exploited by the authorities in order to arrest activist and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was established in the army which monitors and prosecutes the online content and prosecute persons accused of having committed the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">"" "Thailand employs a strict" "" "Lese Majeste" "" "(Majestic)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The video even shows how people are thrown into a black vans before putting them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are in jail because they supposedly caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened long prison terms, they should insult the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile, the teaser of the songs showed members of the band, who imitated the Salut from "The Tribute of Panem," which was already used by Putin's opponents during the 2014 protests.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold-colored earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm whatsoever.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - but there are hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants arriving here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells, come the people in full small busses and start calling from the upper part of the coast: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some slept on cardboard outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, she buys them drugs that they can't pay, she massaging them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mom Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the North.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitians and Africans often travel along the way and that Africans are already talking about Whatsapp of Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a builder at construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we will never leave her again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells her that her guests often send her text messages when they went away to greet her or to report her about the course of her trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"" "" "" "this winter, Valenzuela and his family have included migrants in their small house." ""</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and found that the bus tickets to many African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I have experienced what they are experiencing." ""</seg>

<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After three years of living, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova, Meléndez, tells me that he fled in Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to squeeze money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single educator, offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, travellers still consult their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with african hair lichens she has made a customer, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, while she introduces her to me.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of the city Urumqi received a mobile notification in which they instruct the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the announcement, it is said that the app is intended to prevent access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"" "" "" "however, the authorities also made use of the app for more than the fight against terrorism." ""</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group shortly after they had installed the app.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the police report, the app was able to identify and prosecute the sources and the distribution channels of the terrorists, along with illegal religious activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with underage filters is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reporting on digital censorship in China mostly focuses on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often gloomy for those who live in distant, repressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in the areas of conflict, the authorities often assign extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet, based on Twitter, published photos from a checkpoint where policemen check the residents indiscriminately whether they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, it could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use appliances intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the rest-technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "images from mainland China" "" "also published a" "" "Jingwang product description" "", "which indicates that the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">"" "" "" "the rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions given by the City Council to minimize dissemination of illegal content." ""</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and institutions connected with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity office in the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current report of Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, on June 27, in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities published an order with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" with local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates Urumquis's personality rights of three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political communications.</seg>

<seg id="2061">I can't say more exactly when insults and punches have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice told me that I had to get used to being punished, even though I had done nothing to earn that penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2064">On punishment in all their diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>

<seg id="2073">Within one hour three of them alternated while I was still in line.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped screaming.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he changes to his screen, sometimes to his computer, back and back to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips patch with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaib's family to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as fellowlabourers (e.g. Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questions their proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as Orientalism, Racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all of these issues are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities that reach from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind, and he can sympathize with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he has a special aversion against the American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as a "Palestinian refugees of the second generation," he describes himself, even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so, because of my own circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man," while he pours in water dissolved Nescafé into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the loins speak lukewarm coffee and the wavy of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when you look into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in public during Ramadan to drink water - not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Sinno argued that the cultural and traditional norms of the country are contradictory and the main reason for the concert announcement is.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former Press spokespersons in the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had just been cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the tried-and-tested legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights" who continue to decide "for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement probably should not be simple rhetoric, but actually reflect an increasingly prominent emerging reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib returned traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually trust them.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of "honorary morals" - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary morals reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still more difficult that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been subjected to murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be held in prison for indefinite periods of time," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee provided by the family is necessary that the woman will not be able to do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaib's music also enjoys great popularity and is well known for not shy away from topics that long as taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political but admits that he cannot separate his music that is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was" "" "fed up" "" "politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib tackles the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and" "" "Ghareeb" "", "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, one verse often repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which, in his words, "that can get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya in order to remember that his comments were torn out of context, distorted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but only a edited version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib acquires openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes intolerance to homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuoro, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuoro, who was later to work on behalf of the caliphs, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom, it is nothing new anymore that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service adopted several former members of government and members of the teacher's association, with the rationale that they were critically related to the problems associated with the corruption in the country on commentaries in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the Hdaib concert is, according to the opinion, only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a permanent giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that is Hdaib - consists of slow, deliberate and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial ways of democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is so far, Hdaib will continue to rap and consequently resist.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is presumed that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the solid cars, drums and dancing have taken over more than one thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west marched to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the embashi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">For a long time I look at the Meguro Gajoen: two celebrities are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Yet for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer:</seg>

<seg id="2167">External appearance and body care were rare as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth out of criminality and promote a legitimate trade like the hairstyle.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend to copy the appearance and thus also the extraordinary hairstyles of famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has resulted in getting more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the ultimate limits of fantasy and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the hairdressers "competition" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts face each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and instead of obtaining bad advice to obtain a training in the hairdressing arts that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district, which we are very proud of, because we have built this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "", "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">This article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important, people who feel expelled to accommodate affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Precisely this question left the young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga of the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios of the Young Youth Foundation, and inspired them to the campaign Carta por la Catalliación (Letters to Reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But in front of the Colombians there is still a long way to speak about genuine reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who had lived in illegal camps for many years, were subjected to a rhetoric of war and carrying their weapons around the clock, must now re-integrate into their lives as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now take it into its ranks and support it in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian believed that young Columbians would join together and would have to help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrillas to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighter - who will then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation originated at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those who need them much more needlessly.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year, who needed most urgently.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and have to build a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">More than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the area of Caldono-Cauca on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to bring the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were set up as they had done earlier to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," said the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Garra, a member of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed was a MGL-garnet, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty battle.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said to him," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, that's why I answer it." "" "suddenly tears ran up to me about the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him all the way and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was also tired of the war, was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. joining the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know there is a society outside that waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start, students and some leaders of the FARC joined a discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC were already in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organisation, their ideals, and gave insight into their views of the peace process: "for many years we have seen the social injustice done by the State to the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never heard their hearing and had no right to vote, and realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate, even people with beautiful feelings, who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the Caldono-Cauca camp, wrote the following letter to the Archbishop of Cali, Archbishop of the city of Cali:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Colombians were prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to resort to weapons, raise themselves and protest for their rights. and that is also totally justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all the defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong to - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2244">With horrors, activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs above the LGBTQ community there is not about overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has taken international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published to address the worsening, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Novaya Gaseta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities, who arrested suspicious men and put them into secret prisons in gun-gun.</seg>

<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but nothing hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long will you honor the family, you stain?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had everything to get along and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two cuts in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which wings were you laid - in which of the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, my male name still stands on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time on his office, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he respectfully handled with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I received threats last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They put forward absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by running up above without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grosny and say that I had not changed my race that everything was only bad talk, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It became too much for my mother and she lay down a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately, the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened window panes and a plate with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it had happened for the third time it became clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering me, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "at the moment when I wanted to call my mother per WhatsApp, I received a message:" "" "you don't think you're safe, just because you left the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about gender equality, this is a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I can't overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with a camera, I actually try to look like the person she reminds me of her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed dormant?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has been in gun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he did not lock up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"" "with this I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so-called" "" "honor" "" "has experienced through blood satisfaction." ""</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men now held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine said there weren't so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to settle for Kadyrov's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "Should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, they were deliberately immersed in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was there even when these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports to date. however, we suspect such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and abductions of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think before 2003 I was already known in quite Grozny, when I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally intended to bring us to the" "" "civilization" "", "but eventually threw us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, bore tube jeans and short loops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never bothered me even a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children, when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: until Kadyrov stepped onto the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak on television about morality.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could sense how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Whoever smiled and laughed before, looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I was able to feel the situation in the republic steadily worse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what action do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a sort of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacreff, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food types.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I clapped the places of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear Hidalab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chetschenen, who want to make you white with foam before the mouth that there are no bobbins with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestanders have what, the cabardines have, the Russians too; on the whole planet they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think in transit to men who love men, and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of feeling to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know I'm myself now.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there is a strong increase in suicide.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-incineration of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability of his family to come up, so Ahwazi's human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August in the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families and pursue a safe work because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, located in the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to deny its livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power, and in 1925 took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often a victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and privations.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahwazi Arabs working places in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams, the water from the Arab areas to the Persian territories where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravate the devastation caused by dryness, and destroy local farming as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi teenagers rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Cooperation, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job had completed primary school, 55% had completed secondary school and 45% have university degrees.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist residing in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," led to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">"" "" "" "the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahwaz and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:" ""</seg>
<seg id="2424">As officials and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of the national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livelihood outside their homeland.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their pros and surnames in order to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and be hired as even Arabic names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone the speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi has to endure, human rights activists beat alarms before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world will wake up and take note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on Afroféminas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I am not a female feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - are frustrated with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminists * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays still earn less money in spite of equal education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer double and threefold among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black women's women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention what kind of physical, mental and verbal abuse have been abused, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and to sing" Kumbaya, my Lord "to reach equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist-motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering from domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all people of all skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join a movement in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustice in her mind, which relate to both gender and skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women again and again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "in 1851, Sojourner complained in her saying," "" "Am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a trivial and marginalized being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation in order to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to expose white women to the importance of overlapping skin color and gender. because some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give birth to women of different origins and isolate themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself completely and completely from feminism and to join the movement of the Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than advocating a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism - claims that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article entitled "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" by curtural. the article is part of the series # PorserMujer, which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who had become violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Some time had passed since the end of their relationship and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but they could not do any more.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena for maltreatment, the exact ad of Ada Báez also did not use anything.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman retired.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women are fully refunded, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit being victims of violence must report to the law enforcement agencies.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Inhalt1 Strike and Statistical 2 Invisible abuse and a judicial system that does not undermine 3 Paraguayan laws: good approach, poor implementation blows and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to see how many women are really mistreated, says myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social scientific research facility in Paraguay. "there are different statements and reports that do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The numbers available, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Prosecutor's Office opened 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of them were about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the courts of peace. here again, 86% of the ads of women came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women claimed that they were mistreated, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "on every woman who is refunded in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women come who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "there are two women who do not do this," "" "she declared at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of murder in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, every ten days in Paraguay dies a woman because of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but she gave up. this should be regrettable for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would once become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it, I always thought that it happened only to women who are too submissive because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos myself. he asked rhetorically if he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen so long by Carlos and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that her former partner abused her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network (" "" "I believe you" "" ") that consists of women, all of whom are victims of abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victoria's case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives, they did not receive support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She carried out a process against her former partner who developed into an impenetrable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguayan laws: good base, poor implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"" "" "" "in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied." ""</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porellas (# fürst).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiunaMenos (# Noninvasive) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees to declare femorisation a perpetual criminal record and punish harsher as it is already the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, in some respects, the law text was changed in order to also win the deputies for the law, which feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions is denied, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and punished with up to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had intended to cost the bulk of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs which the victims of violence have to carry even if they simply want to pay an advert and would like to receive a secure accommodation to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse is seen as a part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethink must take place so that violence is no longer considered a normal thing.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Anyone who is silent in the face of these facts is complicit and contributes to the perpetrators of offense.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must reimburse for such a long time until maltreatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate, but parts of the law had been modified before, including a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence had called for reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">"" "" "" "the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack its victims again." ""</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the omanic authorities concluded the independent Arab-speaking newspaper Azamn because of their reporting on corruption in the sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in jail, serving a year-old prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher al-Abri, were also arrested and tried again later.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Since 1970, Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after completing his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the chief ministers in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Finance, Foreign Minister, President of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The sultan's rule is characterized by the insistence of the security forces, in particular domestic intelligence, restricting public liberties, including press freedom, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists to intimidate and detain independent journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically restrict and prevent peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights, including activists, to express their views on the public affairs of the country, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the Azamn paper, its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its inception in 2007 on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, editor-in-chief of Azamn, arrested an article entitled "High-ranking Parties to the Justice of the judiciary." it was about corruption in the judiciary and interference by high-ranking officials in judicial decisions.</seg>

<seg id="2564">The court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were condemned, among other things, for a disturbance of public order, "abuse of the Internet," and "undermining the Present of the State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of a prohibition of publication and slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three year prison terms and fines of 3,000 omanic rial (7800 US dollars).</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of the use of "an information network for the distribution of material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri a refundable deposit of $13,000 was established and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the pronouncement of the sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, but sentenced Al-Haj to six months in prison for a year and Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six-month custodial sentence from the prison in Maskat. al-Haj continues to be in prison, serving his prison sentence.</seg>

<seg id="2573">Despite the court's decision to allow Azamn to resume, the newspaper still faces attacks by the Brazilian government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the minister of information issued an order with which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed another statement, in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, with which the minister once again challenged the decision of the Appeals Court to reinstall the publication of the paper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the freedom of the press was violated in Oman.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Further violations include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the imprisonment of the journalist Al-Haj, the impression arises that the omanic authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) calls on the Korean authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. release Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditional;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a safe environment for the Azamn paper so that their journalists can pursue their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area addressed to one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment in research into these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists helps build up own research capacities in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDR).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the Seventh Health System.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think are the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no fundamental research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain a recipient instead of being a leader himself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where is financing and support coming from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what's the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic education, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, health care (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise, which poses challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"" "the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment (the so-called" "" "paywall" "" ") also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research." ""</seg>

<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by its own imagination and the question of how many types of salads he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents were not only used for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or curled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or cartel varieties. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts in food security care about the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton is still breeding a salad, but it takes longer because his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more limitations.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if in a river a boulder is lying around which I must go down." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do it now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents go too far on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the features are already patented. "he makes it as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries not to use any material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the U.S. and all over the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Roman salat in the "greenhouse" of the station, where it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds as if the movement comes from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for Open-Source "seeds) is inspired by the movement for free" open source "software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">Within the framework of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can undertake to freely use the seed bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who buy seeds to breed their own varieties, and not immediately sow - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the accredited professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the opportunity to grow new plants is important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultivating seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement does not deal with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grains, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," he says and takes on the increasingly common amalgamations of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, which, for example, are offered on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetables are bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed initiative commit themselves to making other seeds available free of charge. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in his PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found that about one-third of all the carrot characteristics are protected as intellectual property, making it suitable for plant breeders either not at all or only difficult to use.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates do not yet exist, but experts such as Luby suspect that mass-grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Matter of Visions</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those by which their taste or color improves to such, because of which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders takes more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before, as the changed conditions are much worse than ever due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto recognises that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts the notion that intellectual property can restrict other breeders as" "" "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "thus, such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing more material and know-how to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this differently: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly won't support innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed on plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and it should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want farmers to make their work easier." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and most recent genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton is interfering with the concept of patenting plant features: "we do not really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety breeds his own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation are needed mass-wise herbicides, grow into its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (those who move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) have patents, most of the smaller seed companies can survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads at his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"" "Morton believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents:" "" "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2682">"" "I always need new material for my catalogue, because I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years," "" "he says." "" "with a patent, it is protected for 20 years ahead of competition, which makes it very easy to believe in my opinion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the USA seems to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, uses a "open-source" seed programme. to preserve the seed of traditional crops, the Centre works with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "Open Source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agrecol pursues an Open Source License, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to country, which is why the Ossi obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, states that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office which permits patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016 the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patents patenting seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's "Open Source" seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for Open Source seed systems for which the official starting signal will be scheduled for next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, technology and concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the latest aims of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock up content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above that.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "August, the network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities sharply criticized and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains true - despite this attack and the ridicule of Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 web sites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the network of Al Jazeera from Qatar due to alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human Rights Organization of the Wave of Website Folders fell victim. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that he writes for websites and media not accessible in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up was to bypass the censorship of the Egyptian government, even the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider in which also Ziadas blog is given, on the other hand, is more accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video how the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Blocking blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even though the bloc of the blogs may not be significant for the world, it is nevertheless for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, attempted murder, discharge at the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other web site for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They proved that I didn't write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to avoid censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after blocking it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blockage of providers that was possible through the circumvention of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs offered began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice suggests the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content that Egyptian users could have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is additionally worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which they can proceed to court for these acts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Newspapers all over Brazil day after day, with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "Thieves robbed the pharmacy with military weapons," "President Timer sends 8500 soldiers of the Army, Navy and Air Force to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the 2017 violence threshold reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on 16 August published the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "", "in which it announced a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything, however, deviating from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the heading "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ruin in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Inner Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 territories that are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to disguise the atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues against the violence as a "war." this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to account for those responsible for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-pleasing neglect of the public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the State of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the State of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the morades per state, Rio is in No.16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to Globo, the largest media company of South America, which, like Cecília, has been emphasizing the security policy of the state for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit established by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to capture a favela by deploying a massive police operation and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decline of violent death cases. however, after several years, the UPP has increasingly been bombarded by harassments and repressions against the poor communities, which should protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles in 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and means that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio are still suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago, the police cleared the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a salesman died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the ensuing civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to Worldwatch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region of East Ghouta, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013, was particularly affected by hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel areas have been besieged by rebel areas outside Damascus, which led to local populations being dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, as they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghira Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The direct of the project, Abo Nabil, said to AFP, the French news agency:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can be planted in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">"" "Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices, that for three years it has been campaigning for announcing this project and expressed its relief that it gains more and more" "" "awareness" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo is used in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families knowledge of the cultivation of mushrooms, so Dr. Leila leads to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue collecting donations to Cando by Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Due to the shortage of fuel, locally produced plastic fuel is used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices, that they began with the" "" "production of fungal seeds from the regions" "", "before they check their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many suburbs in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the North of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and some 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the last week the government called out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Brandies were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 dead.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire eruptions spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite imagery, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of light-combustible wood, as in a vicious circle, spread continuously after fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">To these problems, the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on the 15th and 16th of October, when inhabitants sought information or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of fire brigade and was thus crucial in this fateful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat, dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt helpless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred for Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharpen found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal pit. the work was hard and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of its low wage, and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really hard," "" "Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, on which we also worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating. we hung nylon outside the open windows so that we did not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without documents in Iran and was ready to travel to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharpen came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid patients twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high demand rates, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is also true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes," "" "the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "they are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - what can be drawn up for months after the application has been registered.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his irrepressible twins helped Asharpen to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of working in the construction industry, Asharaf had his entire savings in the creation of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick bite.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now subject to the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxuries - a Hazara in Italy") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Lots of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some Afghans operated companies, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Ashara's aims, however, extend far beyond the Italian gastronomy and retail trade and aim to return to the country that he had forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are opportunities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily when I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have the same possibilities as all others." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf also forged plans for opening a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques." "" "they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but at the end there are stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearance of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the suspension of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen report is an international snapshot showing challenges, victories and emerging trends in worldwide internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">"" "" "" "the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a bill which foresees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority." ""</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users must register to use social networks within six months of the submission of the law on the authority's website, stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months "imprisonment or the final settlement of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was promoted by sixty members of Parliament, is currently in front of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another member of the Board of Deputies filed a legislative proposal that would introduce harsher punishments for the insult of the President or a high official.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under Egyptian law, the offence of the President and state institutions is already punishable. under the legislative proposal, such a crime would, however, be punished with prison and fines, so legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is approved, this can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would undermine a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of violence against protesters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of elected president Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, as more than 700 protesters, who had been arrested in the same incident four years in custody for a court date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison warding failed to bring the accused to the courtroom in prison, according to human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to a so many human rights groups, including arms ownership, illegal gathering, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza released the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for their reporting on pro-Morsi seat blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the penalties of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists interrogated with scanned documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, which is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated on an action plan backed out by the President of the Republic, which, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would ensure business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption official amnesty if they return all unlawful funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on the website of Nawaat on 21 April casts a light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia refused to mention his sources by stating Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which journalists are entitled to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 09th May as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to submit their ID?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new regulations of the Information Office of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the provisions that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suggest that the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within the social networks is to be achieved. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Then do we see ourselves in "WeChat?"</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roscommnadzor, WeChat failed to register as the" "" "organizer of the distribution of information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and to force them upon request for suspension of user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These web pages include websites such as VContacts and Odnoverniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service Mail.Ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has blockage Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia admins refused to delete two English-language articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication has announced that the site was closed because it was" "" "a source of information that cooperates with groups to add a political diffusion campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the site. it is, among others, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain can't stop to sniff</seg>
<seg id="2968">Following this week of leaked documents, Britain's government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install Backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence services concerning the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
