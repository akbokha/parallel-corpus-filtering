this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him , because as a New York Times repor@@ ter , he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
long before someone had heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally heard phones of Americans .
but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA gave Iran literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter at all ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has determined crack and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the cour@@ a@@ geous they disclose .
so when the government le@@ aked at tears , he did something that many cour@@ a@@ geous repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they had been stating for years that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government were dropped at risk .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters and sources can hide more and less .
instead of failing to make statements , this could also take care of his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , secretly bought his phone in secret ,
just like his email data , financial and banking information , his credit appointment , and even travel cards with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s alleged source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all .
but just as technology allows the government to b@@ ypass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there are communication software , which has not yet been , when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls .
one such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot secretly proc@@ ure information , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze all of us .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology specialists such as Edward Snow@@ den have the opportunity to apply mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
who wants to know about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report from over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environ@@ ment@@ alist who suggests alert to the poll@@ uted water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall Street in@@ sider that warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to find an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister res@@ ig@@ ned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad has tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is said that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend from chil@@ dr@@ ens &apos; days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are anxi@@ ous to wait for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agency or John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems crying away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this concern us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and that concerns all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , this disclosure is phenom@@ enal .
in the whole world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and conc@@ eal their wealth -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these buildings .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters .
I find it interesting also that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
presumably because there were no prominent Americans in these revelations , which occurred in this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are not enough Americans to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle in which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see far more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , some US states need less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card .
this type of transparency in the USA has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school@@ children .
frau@@ d@@ sters are allowed to rip off especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a hidden investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked all of us until a lawyer made proposals to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers accepted us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anyone , but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it &apos;s not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability established .
and in order to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may sound very dark as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite well that some things have started to change .
over the past few years , we have seen prec@@ ep@@ ts towards more transparency regarding the owners of companies .
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has registered in central registers at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties submitted a draft bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress that we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us firms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally stop the transparency which now allows this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a ticket sales .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I gaz@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ?
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sh@@ one on to@@ e tips to the door , and shut down my bedroom door .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my perspective .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as foreigners in childhood , were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a time jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and breakfast each morning .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and thus created &quot; air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes were completely different because we made them for our guests .
when we left our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I joined us .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things got rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if one could make a business concept out of it .
thus we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors you close when you visit .
over the Internet , they can then invite foreign people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the ro@@ cket to ign@@ ite .
but it is not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you will find the things you can do well . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design make something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample , which degree of trust we were striving for .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I want you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting room@@ mate .
this soft touch of panic that you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read their SMS , they see your bedroom , kitchen , toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
that &apos;s how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so , who is now Al Gor@@ es cell phone ?
on Twitter , could you declare that he is in charge of the office of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had presented himself first with his name ; if he told him where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you &apos;d have 150 assessments that everyone says : &quot; he can really hold down very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to give up your mobile phone ?
a well thought out feedback system significantly strengthens trust .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to give negative assessments .
in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest handed out their reviews before we placed them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence .
surprisingly , we trust the people most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when adding a person &apos;s call -- in our case by assessments .
if you have fewer than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stems from common ground .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted love .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you are revealing of yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you talk too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great works of art in your home ! I &apos;m going on vacation with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we didn &apos;t expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a need that had not been covered beforehand .
the business is very good for us .
of course there are also times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed party parties or have rav@@ aged apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all phone calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million spent over@@ nights had a problem .
for men trust one another .
if trust works , it can create wonderful things .
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital if you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books .
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay starts .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing work with money transactions ?
this is an economic transaction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is now simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing won &apos;t do justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people open a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
when you are travelling these days , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place you visited , a group there would wait there to fill a thoroughly and show you a quarter of which you have never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays flats are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to create flats from scratch ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would take the thought of shared share ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea capital Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking spaces included in the government ,
students who were looking for a residence ,
were given to people whose children had moved out . incu@@ b@@ ator programs were started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it has been taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality was already there before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why did it work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this start@@ ling ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
that &apos;s how the media represent people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans mean most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk with their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten .
no , not as a homosex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head @-@ cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , which I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was confident and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet loves you somehow ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and began to marry like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flying in buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly turned into indignation .
why should one do such a thing ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Middle Eastern ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it is not only my country being attacked , but in the n@@ u , the deeds of others transformed me from a citizen into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day , we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I drove -- when we drove sil@@ ently -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in@@ doors all the week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims , drag@@ ged and struck .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I got rid of the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it &apos;s not easy to have to explain yourself constantly .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually say people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the US .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only kept under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less , because the question is wrong .
Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumour in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic champi@@ ons .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there might be some parking lots , but do not stop terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a closer look at people of other beliefs and to show greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently said : people are actually not radic@@ alized in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
during the radic@@ alization process , it has been established that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even by their family so that the extrem@@ ist group believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ it@@ or or belief .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we have to stop the people to go to the mos@@ que .
some people still say that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
when Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves to the world of creation by recognis@@ ing them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups maintain their ideology in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every priest with whom she spoke had silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution .
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight as to how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian system of governance , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
one study shows that when people submit messages reported neg@@ atively about Muslims , they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood against Muslims sli@@ pped upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two periods of election .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can indeed be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear is harmful to all of us .
in the assignment of collective guilt , it is not just about having to explain itself .
De@@ h and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ h was an ath@@ lete .
he was at the Faculty of Medicine , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such an experienced young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , has murdered her , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who visited her in the afternoon .
he spent eight times on De@@ h .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or stayed safely at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took it out , pulled my shoes off , went into the hall of prayer , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came , not to attack us , but to help us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had brought courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a noble thought factory , so an exception rather than the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I &apos;d say , don &apos;t be fo@@ ol@@ ed . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m not an exception in any way .
if people like an exception usually appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about becoming a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air p@@ act moun@@ ts into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bricks live in front of the public . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting each other , air units reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces .
you can also build self @-@ winding structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ences and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it must be collective to know where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculations on board determine what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight machine trying to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than a helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most of the star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . okay .
during our research , we often face fundamental abstract questions that lead to the core of the matter .
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand mo@@ ve@@ able parts that gather to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ ate , the mechanically simplest remote @-@ used aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is quite simple , there is a lot happening inside the interior so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room .
however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern star@@ ters . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it right when I watch all is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the assem@@ bler is an exercise in suffici@@ ency , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in excess .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only sym@@ metric .
therefore he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
as a result it receives the extraordinary ability ,
move in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some can be imagined in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s see that .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they need to be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate twin prop@@ ellers .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , if limited .
we will now demonstrate this by making half of the f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ governed . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the especially safe machine over there would like to be a flying shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for guys like us , wages are in development and creative act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , intelligent creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy , so the mass of three suns flo@@ cked into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
this short moment they lit bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time fabric itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
first of all , we arrange the events tempor@@ ally .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ zel@@ liges living on Earth was created .
since then , the earth has produced a lot of things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is at us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group decided to build a huge laser detector , especially cour@@ a@@ geous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech - to search for gravit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ lu@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , design and extremely hard work , they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometer gravit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which enormously improved the recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o now .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start of the detector , the gravit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes ro@@ de through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the f@@ arewell to my sick father .
in essence , this was the fruits of my life .
AA : that &apos;s my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gravity waves of black holes for 23 years and their observations like lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gravit@@ ational waves ?
a gravit@@ ational wave is a c@@ row in the fabric of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and st@@ owed in the other .
to illustrate , instructors in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead to a really alpine dance .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous , are .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and smo@@ ked by the waves . the el@@ on@@ gation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is , 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 .
with a five @-@ kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be accurately measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ th of a radius of a atomic nucle@@ us . that is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gravit@@ ation
Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical . for example , you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming around you from several points .
in the case of sounds , that is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
about the face of your child .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; now Alice is talking . &quot;
&quot; and Bob is interrup@@ ting her . &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the space .
listening to the gravity , about the collision of two black holes can tell us about the collision with my colleague Scott .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just circular : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies turn very fast , one hears the same cir@@ cus with an additional key change . that sounds like this : W@@ u Yi@@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; sur@@ ren@@ des Sound &#93; Som@@ e@@ one who knows what to hear , this recognizes as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling a hundred times per second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to research the universe , as it has never been possible before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space can we -- practically or basically -- not see .
a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars are explo@@ ding in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot from them all over the universe .
but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucle@@ us hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through because these are op@@ a@@ que .
gravit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the Big B@@ ang is obsc@@ ured by its own after@@ glow .
with the help of gravit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that there exist in space that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first run , which we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes as Lig@@ o watches them are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are , so to speak , the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different angle of view on the events of space , on the creation of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year , I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , removed my fear .
my fear of keeping speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life has changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a definite yes , which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected kind . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest one , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude towards life in my family . from then on , I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I &apos;m going , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very sorry .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , awaken you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I &apos;m making television , in great style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for putting out 70 hours of program in the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV transmitter can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days with four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows simultaneously in production , sometimes four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run succ@@ essively on Thursday evening .
throughout the world , my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of those 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts I have created myself and not only produced , so still overhead . I must find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who is doing this ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a classroom , take me seriously when I speak of work so you understand that I am not just typing on the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it is true when I say : I understand that it does not dream with a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m deep@@ ened into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops as I painted on a canvas .
in such a way , if you have a high tone , deliver a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is sum@@ ming .
there is such a change in me when work is going well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever .
many people accept when I tell them the sums that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the sums -- when I began to work and work and work together with television production , when I began to work and work , build , create and work together , I discovered this matter , this sums , this energy .
the tot@@ em is more than writing .
the tot@@ em is action and activity . sum@@ ming is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the sum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can &apos;t aim differently than by size .
the feeling of not being different than striving for size , no matter what price .
this is called sum@@ ming .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not do@@ omed for failure , and I only know that I love sum@@ ming .
I just want to tell you that I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more episodes the more work there is , the more things I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country that I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high tone , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love sum@@ ming .
I need the sums . I am the sum .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the sum@@ ming stopped .
re@@ worked , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the tot@@ als stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mo@@ m is one worker .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums ceased .
the bu@@ zz of the motor was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was out .
the tot@@ em did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show@@ piece Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the sum@@ ming was me .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fa@@ des away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hypo@@ c@@ rites , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you are doing it , you work , you are working , you love what you do , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love someone else and that gives you a bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz , when you know the bu@@ zz when the bu@@ zz stops , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become aware of me :
first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no one more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my sums are smo@@ other , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of sum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country that I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high tone - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl puts in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I am breathing .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door enters and an energy boost comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing comes back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel as though I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the working sums , the titanium dioxide , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the tot@@ em is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the true sum@@ ming depends on love .
the tot@@ em is the current coming from the lust of life .
true sum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
true sum@@ ming ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to experience , expectation and pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the true sum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not just the way I work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at the workplace than at home .
this admission is painful , for what kind of person does he prefer to be at home ?
well , yes , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we ro@@ de around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dream .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something different .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ äfer or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and talking my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more it does not need .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes a day !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children make bet@@ ting .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the sum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; playing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I sh@@ out and I won . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training , when I wanted to exceed myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz@@ ing came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to return when I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the h@@ um , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum , the sum@@ ming is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum@@ ming now .
the sum of life .
the hum@@ ming of love .
the sum of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s just for me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan who is travelling to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I create , the marathon I run , the troops , the screens , the high tone , the sums , the sums , the other , the right sum : the sum of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , dying , bare and new feeling of life is within me . less Titan - more I !
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , I &apos;m considering you to live .
this belongs to the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to work less and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to heal itself .
after a serious injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor trying to improve the nervous functions through various surgical procedures .
one of the most well @-@ known is the &quot; brain stimulation . &quot; an electrode im@@ planted in the brain im@@ planted in order to influence the neur@@ ons circuits in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease that suffered severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is to restore the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was chief doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they need to imagine that the brain l@@ ur@@ ks the brain in the skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas and the head of the skull increases .
in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull .
to do this you sometimes need to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve .
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François failed .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked just like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from the biology lesson that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OR .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells were different .
they spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they account for 4 % of our herd @-@ brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage they care for the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations .
but this is not so certain .
one thing is clear however -- we got our stem cells from these cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then color them in color to be able to keep track of them in the brain .
in the last step , we re @-@ en@@ anti@@ ated them at the acceptance test of the same individual .
we call aut@@ olog@@ ram Transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ arrange these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ arrange the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario , we re @-@ en@@ anti@@ ated the cells into a healthy brain and observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been taken again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury and reim@@ plant@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ planted .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture .
of course , we couldn &apos;t stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from a tablet .
they did it very well .
when they had reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor skills range in the motor cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen in people , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his level of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
see now when we reim@@ pl@@ agu@@ ed the cells : the same monkey , two months after the plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that was also very exciting for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giuss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest barriers are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill around two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you look further into the future , how many years it takes to get someone to come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first of all depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
first , you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to look at it as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to look at them as un@@ changing ti@@ dings .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , democracy over@@ comes with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- could not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my dar@@ ing friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would aboli@@ sh if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for a real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro Group succ@@ um@@ bed to a mis@@ belief , we could save ourselves democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and defensive democracy .
for without democracy our societies are mixed , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies wa@@ sted .
on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin peaks parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a top is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt , which casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognise its twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy business@@ men and corporations , who , however , are too anxi@@ ous to invest in where it would be productive and generate income with which it would be productive and could produce all the things that humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the US , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , railway tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars may sound like a lot of money until one compar@@ es it to the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to b@@ ump off the stock markets and raise the real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , like in an endless loop , advoc@@ ates the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , who , fear@@ ing the prophecy of the ear , could be true that his son would kill him when he grows up ,
un@@ intentionally causes the circumstances that cause the body to kill him .
this is my stri@@ fe with capitalism --
his extremely wast@@ eful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy based on these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive thing about the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was and is that they were engaged in the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , that they granted them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same wei@@ ghting in questions of state matters .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted long --
like a candle that g@@ lows very bright , it is also quickly burned out .
however , our present @-@ day liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a statute for rulers .
for liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was bor@@ dered on politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of corporations -- was a democratic zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place by the economy gradually under@@ mining politics and dis@@ em@@ power@@ ing it .
are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not about a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power because the power of politics has mig@@ rated into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my sh@@ arks with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about as much as a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors , which has decim@@ ated the animals from which it nour@@ ishes , decim@@ ated that they are star@@ ving at the end .
it is similar to the economy that has tou@@ red politics so far that it har@@ ms itself through the self @-@ induced economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are being de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality rises , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to re@@ unite politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea by the way .
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not go well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position like in ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robo@@ tics .
the problem here is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste subli@@ me , and the social conflicts lower , like it -- already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
so we have to re@@ organise the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and ensure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; matrix &quot; appear like a documentary .
so the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which he has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines are used in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which people are in the study of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples .
in the area of companies : please imagine a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one works -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income from capital and income arises and the concept of wage labour is completely out@@ dated .
no distinction between those who belong to the company but do not work in it , and employees who work there who do not belong to the company . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please note that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency backed by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have them , especially against the background of a re @-@ united politics and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe is simultaneously liber@@ ator@@ ily in which it fav@@ ors privileged individuals , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , globally Key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all else it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we awaken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and the economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive decrease in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers is referred to as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
like Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are happy too .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t think you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you hold from the West &apos;s view to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a certain sense , if I can say this as pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism to democracy -- this is a mistake historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was very scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West did in the nineteenth century , sm@@ ells tremend@@ ously after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that was coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say good @-@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive fault line passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues , which threat@@ ens mas@@ sively the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the inci@@ dentally , the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have also chosen den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what &apos;s coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to get an economic system that is not capable of maintaining life through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but if change happens , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you anticipate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future unless we change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they merely wanted to bring down our government , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that for 5 years they had passed a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika from the financi@@ ers imposed on us this policy was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive sounding of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will demon@@ ize and destroy the European Union .
this will not have disa@@ strous consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to embar@@ k on the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it seems to me , it will be just as bear@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you are wrong at this point .

Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price , most have never heard , although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an idi@@ ot and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Films , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy cannot select one .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , it must find shows that are located right on this curve .
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows receive this rating .
if your show is valued at nine and above , it will be a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where after you have looked at a relay , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price doesn &apos;t care about getting to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to forbi@@ d &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average payout , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon is doing something , that &apos;s why Roy Price wants nothing to risk .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where they can watch every one for free .
and if Amazon gives things out for nothing , one reaches , right ?
millions of spectators are watching these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you can record when you start the show , when you pause , what parts you skip or look at once again .
you collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process it and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
at about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of hosting a competition , he and his team watched the available data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows the course of which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the viewers : what shows they like , which producers , what actors .
when they had all the pieces together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what &apos;s going on here ?
we have two very competitive , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow means that it should work with everything .
when collecting millions of data for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is a little frigh@@ tening because we live in a time when we reach more and more statistics to make serious choices , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems here ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room will ever come into contact with this software .
if someone is in jail here in the U.S. and asks for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are produced . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the aw@@ ful way , they can fores@@ ee -- through data analysis of the Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year around year around year , until it suddenly stopped working ,
and no one could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these mistakes , data streams into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted genetics -- an area where some very clever people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious choices , such as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , disman@@ tle this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second , put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and to understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to put parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise not have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; is not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they compete for TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is what the data say to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order to remember that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will try it later with a technique demonstration .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have heard in hin@@ d@@ sight on the ball .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what one is doing , and taking risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
