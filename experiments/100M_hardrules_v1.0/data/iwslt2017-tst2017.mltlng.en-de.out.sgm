<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him, because as a New York Times reporter, he won the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally heard phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA gave Iran literally drafts for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has determined crack and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and spy journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they disclose.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government leaked at tears, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they had been stating for years that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government were dropped at risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can hide more and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing to make statements, this could also take care of his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, secretly bought his phone in secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and banking information, his credit appointment, and even travel cards with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA Whistleblower and Risen's alleged source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead the judiciary condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology allows the government to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software, which has not yet been, when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot secretly procure information, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that jeopardize all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technology specialists such as Edward Snowden have the opportunity to apply misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to know about grievances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report from overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmentalist who suggests alert to the polluted water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider that warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[what does it mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to find an explanation.] this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is said that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend from childrens' days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are anxious to wait for the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agency or John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this concern us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, this disclosure is phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the whole world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and conceal their wealth -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these buildings.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting also that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there were no prominent Americans in these revelations, which occurred in this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are not enough Americans to hide their wealth in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle in which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see far more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, some US states need less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of transparency in the USA has allowed employees of school districts to rip off schoolchildren.</seg>
<seg id="69">Fraudsters are allowed to rip off especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked all of us until a lawyer made proposals to our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers accepted us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anyone, but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it's not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability established.</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we must change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound very dark as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite well that some things have started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years, we have seen precepts towards more transparency regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has registered in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties submitted a draft bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress that we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy who get up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of intransparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally stop the transparency which now allows this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a ticket sales.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," "" "Where are you sleeping tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse," "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "and I thought," "" "Oh, man!" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "one voice in my head said:" "" "Ah, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I lay in bed, I gazed at the ceiling and thought, "Oh man! what did I get there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he's crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, shone on toe tips to the door, and shut down my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as foreigners in childhood, were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To house people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate pulls out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and breakfast each morning.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and thus created "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-omelettes were completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">When we left our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I joined us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things got rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make a business concept out of it.</seg>
<seg id="138">Thus we presented to investors: "we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors you close when you visit.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite foreign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the rocket to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But it is not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in homes of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you will find the things you can do well. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample, which degree of trust we were striving for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I want you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting roommate.</seg>
<seg id="157">This soft touch of panic that you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read their SMS, they see your bedroom, kitchen, toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">That's how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who is now Al Gores cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">On Twitter, could you declare that he is in charge of the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had presented himself first with his name; if he told him where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you'd have 150 assessments that everyone says: "he can really hold down very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to give up your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought out feedback system significantly strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to give negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest handed out their reviews before we placed them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Surprisingly, we trust the people most, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when adding a person's call -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have fewer than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stems from common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deep-rooted love.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you are revealing of yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you talk too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "tell too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "" "great works of art in your home! I'm going on vacation with my family." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we didn't expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly, a need that had not been covered beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are also times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed party parties or have ravaged apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all phone calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million spent overnights had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For men trust one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, it can create wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of sitting activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital if you die and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay starts.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing work with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is an economic transaction.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is now simply" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing won't do justice." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People open a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you are travelling these days, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you visited, a group there would wait there to fill a thoroughly and show you a quarter of which you have never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays flats are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to create flats from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would take the thought of shared share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea capital Seoul, this project has already begun. lots of parking spaces included in the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Students who were looking for a residence,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children had moved out. incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it has been taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was already there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did it work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this startling,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use design in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">That's how the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans mean most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern-Fitness-Fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I decided to outen.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head-cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, which I felt as 17-year-old to adapt myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passively accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was confident and slow devotion that deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone perceives you, understands you completely, and yet loves you somehow?</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began to marry like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">"" "later, after my marriage, I had a child and basically lived the" "" "Egyptian American Dream" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking news."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flying in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical malfunction?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">""... "Muslim terrorists" ""... "" ""... "in the name of Islam..." ""... "Middle Eastern..." ""... "Jihad..." ""... "" ""</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country being attacked, but in the nu, the deeds of others transformed me from a citizen into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to travel through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I drove -- when we drove silently -- as deep as it went into my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations saying:" "" "be vigilant," "" "" Be careful, "" "" "" "" Stay in well lit areas, "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed indoors all the week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings came:" "" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims, dragged and struck.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I got rid of the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It's not easy to have to explain yourself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"" "nowadays we can actually say people say:" "" "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims." ""</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the US.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only kept under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless, because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumour in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic champions.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There might be some parking lots, but do not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to a closer look at people of other beliefs and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently said: people are actually not radicalized in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radicalization process, it has been established that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even by their family so that the extremist group believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or belief.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we have to stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people still say that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">When Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves to the world of creation by recognising them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups maintain their ideology in their" "" "Holy Book" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when you look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" "" "Holy Scriptures." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every priest with whom she spoke had silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization of extremists who promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight as to how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian system of governance, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows that when people submit messages reported negatively about Muslims, they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood against Muslims slipped upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two periods of election.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can indeed be a tool for manipulating the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear is harmful to all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective guilt, it is not just about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deh and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deh was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the Faculty of Medicine, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous man she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when is such an experienced young man from my brother?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, has murdered her, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who visited her in the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="376">He spent eight times on Deh.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be not only immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or stayed safely at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took it out, pulled my shoes off, went into the hall of prayer, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came, not to attack us, but to help us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had brought courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TEDTalk, a thinker with draught, working in a noble thought factory, so an exception rather than the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I'd say, don't be fooled. I'm totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am not an exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at Muslims around the world, and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm not an exception in any way.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people like an exception usually appear, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about becoming a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air pact mounts into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Frac Centre in France built a six-meter high tower from 1 500 bricks live in front of the public. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting each other, air units reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-winding structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulences and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to function autonomously, it must be collective to know where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, calculations on board determine what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available on the highest level e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight machine trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than a helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the starters, it can float, and has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn't matter in which position the optimal position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often face fundamental abstract questions that lead to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moveable parts that gather to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospate, the mechanically simplest remote-used aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is quite simple, there is a lot happening inside the interior so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern starters. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of throwing it right when I watch all is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the assembler is an exercise in sufficiency, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in excess.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result it receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter in which direction it is rotated or even rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some can be imagined in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they need to be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate twin propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making half of the flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-governed. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially safe machine over there would like to be a flying shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us, wages are in development and creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, intelligent creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy, so the mass of three suns flocked into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lit brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into space-time fabric itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">First of all, we arrange the events temporally.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, multi-zelliges living on Earth was created.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has produced a lot of things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is at us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group decided to build a huge laser detector, especially courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech - to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colluding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, design and extremely hard work, they built the detector Ligo: the Laser Interferometer gravitational-waves-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which enormously improved the recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo now.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes rode through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence, this was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: that's my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravity waves of black holes for 23 years and their observations like ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crow in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and stowed in the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate, instructors in courses on the theory of relativity often lead to a really alpine dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous, are.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and smoked by the waves. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is, 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be accurately measured on less than a thousandth of a radius of a atomic nucleus. that is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. for example, you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming around you from several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the case of sounds, that is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice is talking."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob is interrupting her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the space.</seg>
<seg id="522">Listening to the gravity, about the collision of two black holes can tell us about the collision with my colleague Scott.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just circular: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">If the two bodies turn very fast, one hears the same circus with an additional key change. that sounds like this: Wu Yiwu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [surrendes Sound] Someone who knows what to hear, this recognizes as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as fast as the rods of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling a hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to research the universe, as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space can we -- practically or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A super-nova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars are exploding in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot from them all over the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational-waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, since the Big Bang is obscured by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there exist in space that we have never seen before, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first run, which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes as Ligo watches them are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different angle of view on the events of space, on the creation of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circus of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year, I would say" "" "yes!" "" "I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of keeping speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes, which changed my life deeply, to an unexpected kind. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest one, calls all" "" "kittens" "", "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kittens, I need milk for my beak-cup." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude towards life in my family. from then on, I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I'm going, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very sorry.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I'm a writer. I think things out, awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm making television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for putting out 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV transmitter can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days with four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three shows simultaneously in production, sometimes four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run successively on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">Throughout the world, my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of those 70 TV-hours are broadcasts I have created myself and not only produced, so still overhead. I must find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think if the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a classroom, take me seriously when I speak of work so you understand that I am not just typing on the computer and imaginative, and it is true when I say: I understand that it does not dream with a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm deepened into the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">In such a way, if you have a high tone, deliver a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is summing.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could go for it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I tell them the sums that I'm talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began to work and work and work together with television production, when I began to work and work, build, create and work together, I discovered this matter, this sums, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The totem is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The totem is action and activity. summing is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The summing is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you can't aim differently than by size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being different than striving for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called summing.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not doomed for failure, and I only know that I love summing.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you that I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more episodes the more work there is, the more things I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country that I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love summing.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the summing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Reworked, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is one worker.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "kittens, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the motor was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The totem did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a Titan does not sleep, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no summing.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showpiece Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the summing was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fades away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "hypocrites, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you are doing it, you work, you are working, you love what you do, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love someone else and that gives you a buzz when you know the buzz, when you know the buzz when the buzz stops, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she calls no one more" "" "kittens" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and my sums are smoother, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in the absence of summing, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country that I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high tone - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl puts in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I am breathing.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door enters and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzzing comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzzing, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as though I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working sums, the titanium dioxide, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The totem is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The true summing depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The totem is the current coming from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">True summing is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">True summing ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to experience, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The true summing is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not just the way I work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, for what kind of person does he prefer to be at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rode around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you think me naive, for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talking my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more it does not need.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a day!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children make betting.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the summing, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to play" "" "playing" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I shout and I won. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training, when I wanted to exceed myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not treat yourself for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzzing came back in my spare time. the buzzing seems to return when I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the hum, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sum, the summing is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my summing now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sum of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The humming of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's just for me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan who is travelling to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children are.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear my head is.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country I create, the marathon I run, the troops, the screens, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the other, the right sum: the sum of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, dying, bare and new feeling of life is within me. less Titan - more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this buzz, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I'm a writer. I think things out, I'm considering you to live.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, which means living his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "to work less and more games." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans don't have a chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor trying to improve the nervous functions through various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">One of the most well-known is the "brain stimulation." an electrode implanted in the brain implanted in order to influence the neurons circuits in such a way that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is to restore the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was chief doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They need to imagine that the brain lurks the brain in the skull-brain traumas and the head of the skull increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">To do this you sometimes need to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François failed.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked just like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biology lesson that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OR.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They account for 4% of our herd-brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage they care for the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain, as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear however -- we got our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then color them in color to be able to keep track of them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we re-enantiated them at the acceptance test of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call autologram Transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we re-arrange these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-arrange the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we re-enantiated the cells into a healthy brain and observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been taken again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and reimplantated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-planted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course, we couldn't stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had reached a stable skill level, we injured the motor skills range in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in people, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as with the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his level of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">See now when we reimplagued the cells: the same monkey, two months after the plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that was also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" "" "I know someone who can do that." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest barriers are the authorities. based on these great results, you have to fill around two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you look further into the future, how many years it takes to get someone to come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First of all depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First, you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to look at it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as unchanging tidings.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "indeed, democracy overcomes with us, in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistakably clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- could not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my daring friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would abolish if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Euro Group succumbed to a misbelief, we could save ourselves democracy, but that we need a truthful and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are mixed, our future gloomy and our great new technologies wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of extravagance, I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin peaks paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A top is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt, which casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognise its twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy businessmen and corporations, who, however, are too anxious to invest in where it would be productive and generate income with which it would be productive and could produce all the things that humanity desperately needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the US, England and the eurozone, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, railway tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars may sound like a lot of money until one compares it to the 5.1 trillion US dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to bump off the stock markets and raise the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, like in an endless loop, advocates the pessimism of investors, who, fearing the prophecy of the ear, could be true that his son would kill him when he grows up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causes the circumstances that cause the body to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my strife with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His extremely wasteful art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the Athenian democracy included too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy based on these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the athenical democracy was and is that they were engaged in the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, that they granted them the right to political co-determination with the same weighting in questions of state matters.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy hasn't lasted long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that glows very bright, it is also quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present-day liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was bordered on politics, while the economy -- that is, the world of corporations -- was a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place by the economy gradually undermining politics and disempowering it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not about a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power because the power of politics has migrated into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharks with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about as much as a herd of predators, which has decimated the animals from which it nourishes, decimated that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that has toured politics so far that it harms itself through the self-induced economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are being devalued, the inequality rises, the macroeconomic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we have to reunite politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea by the way.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not go well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position like in ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers through automation and robotics.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem here is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste sublime, and the social conflicts lower, like it -- already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to reorganise the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and ensure that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the film "matrix" appear like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which he has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "matrix," in which machines are used in "Star Trek," in which people are in the study of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long discussions the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia rather than the "matrix" similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies: please imagine a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one works -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and income arises and the concept of wage labour is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company but do not work in it, and employees who work there who do not belong to the company. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please note that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency backed by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "today we have them, especially against the background of a re-united politics and economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe is simultaneously liberatorily in which it favors privileged individuals, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and the economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will produce such a massive decrease in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers is referred to as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Like Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are happy too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't think you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you hold from the West's view to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain sense, if I can say this as provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism to democracy -- this is a mistake historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was very sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now proposing to do what the West did in the nineteenth century, smells tremendously after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I thought that was coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely to say good-bye to the complacency, and the permanent denial that a massive fault line passed through the eurozone, and continues, which threatens massively the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the incidentally, the first suggestion that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, have also chosen denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to get an economic system that is not capable of maintaining life through political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but if change happens, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you anticipate?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future unless we change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone looking back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he has made no mistake, then that is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request for extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But there was no such thing.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring down our government, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that ran through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that for 5 years they had passed a catastrophic program in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "there is worse than during the" "" "Great Depression." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the troika from the financiers imposed on us this policy was:" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive sounding of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "" "" "my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, the released centrifugal forces will demonize and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have disastrous consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to embark on the path of a post-modern 1930, after which it seems to me, it will be just as bearable for the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for having been with TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price, most have never heard, although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an idiot and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "Films, TV, Technique, Tacos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy cannot select one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, it must find shows that are located right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows receive this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and above, it will be a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" "" "Breaking Bad," "" "" Game of Thrones "" "," "" "" The Wire "" "," "" "" The Wire "" "," where after you have looked at a relay, your brain asks: "" "" where are there more of these episodes? "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left side, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- -- this should tell you enough what's going on at this end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price doesn't care about getting to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to forbid "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the average payout, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's the first time Amazon is doing something, that's why Roy Price wants nothing to risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where they can watch every one for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon gives things out for nothing, one reaches, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You can record when you start the show, when you pause, what parts you skip or look at once again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process it and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of hosting a competition, he and his team watched the available data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows the course of which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the viewers: what shows they like, which producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the pieces together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four Senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what's going on here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">We have two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow means that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When collecting millions of data for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is a little frightening because we live in a time when we reach more and more statistics to make serious choices, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room will ever come into contact with this software.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the U.S. and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are produced. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the awful way, they can foresee -- through data analysis of the Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year around year, until it suddenly stopped working,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these mistakes, data streams into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very clever people use unimaginably many data to make serious choices, such as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, dismantle this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a second, put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and to understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reassemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to put parts and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think Netflix was so successful because they have used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise not have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" is not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they compete for TV ideas, then when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say," "" "This is what the data say to us." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order to remember that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it's also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- right here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will try it later with a technique demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have heard in hindsight on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">In the end, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what one is doing, and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
