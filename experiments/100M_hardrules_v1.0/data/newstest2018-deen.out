Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren institution , where young people should meet today .
a pit chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small gar@@ den@@ ers cultivate the former cause of farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the oldest official map of Munich fo@@ sters exciting stories to days .
it gets annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows that , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a stra@@ pping road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but precisely so very informative .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ ich , which one recognizes as such .
for cities and municipalities detailed maps , so @-@ called exposure sheets , have been incorporated into the large map .
these were created according to the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and were made up of the first surve@@ ying of Bavaria .
your Princip@@ al : Napoleon .
the French army leader has occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops finally removed the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 , it was the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph pushed forward the project , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and there@@ with the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the source for Munich originates from the year 18@@ 56 and is found like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the comparison of the former / today is the most impressive in the example of the state capital . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Send@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built 21 years after the map was created , i.e. 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings were concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present @-@ day Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in appears a smaller @-@ scale map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered head@@ ings from the so @-@ called &quot; original recording &quot; from which the land tax was derived .
small plots yield no more farmers today , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the location of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the present district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen it is not only the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the ventilation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once blocked people with ma@@ dness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich District Ir@@ ren@@ aissance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden was head of the institution - that psychiat@@ rist who is brought in connection with King Ludwig II &apos;s death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and for example finished the bet@@ ting of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also prohibited the personnel from applying violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there was first place , later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ ae@@ us in Haar 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ East is one of the largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts in Germany since 2006 .
on the premises of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , you@@ ths now meet at the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities .
West is the football pitch of the TS@@ V München East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children house - in architectural reference to the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ aissance , was destroyed during World War II in bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger lane was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed a lot of holes in the city centre .
a large one remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn trunk will take place .
with the sli@@ der you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil Rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of F@@ ish@@ ers has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i because of the discrimin@@ atory policy and ra@@ cial attacks of the State .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to come into force by 28 August 2017 , ur@@ ges af@@ ro @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , ra@@ cial incidents occur in the whole state and are recorded here , &quot; says the group .
a recent law passed by Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , as well as the state prosec@@ uting authorities , who are dispro@@ portion@@ ately target@@ ing minorities , prompted the group to publish the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights , people happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped or killed because of their skin colour , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization of a state in the United States .
the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more petrol during the trip and was put into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without acc@@ using any crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s office in which it is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state will be 75 percent more frequent than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready to bring their money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crime report program of the FB@@ I , which classi@@ fy the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the United States had passed immigration laws , comm@@ itting local prosec@@ uting authorities to arrest people for immigration off@@ ences , which will contribute to further race profil@@ ing in view of the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently , interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .
electric fence project is el@@ em@@ ental
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U members Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have given themselves a picture on the spot .
at the grave yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U stand met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann granted first insight into his farm , in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young k@@ itt@@ ens looked after and accommod@@ ated in five apartments holiday palaces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing way for him for the milk of his cows , thus Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
region@@ ales only come to the table of the holiday guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V chairman of Fisch@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot profit on such steep surfaces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the green area care for a lot of work , a lot of things need to be worked on with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental business and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not conduct a bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader @-@ promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the land could be delayed for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants .
the area of conservation amounts to 40 hectares , which may not be aff@@ or@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the leader was promoted , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus the farmers had 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometres of wheat fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and rural women it &apos;s not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiß asser@@ ted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Area ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg makes it possible for the government to promote soft f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the presence of a circul@@ ating background specified by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the enclosed area must not be tractor @-@ free ( slope inclin@@ ation over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened with re@@ for@@ estation .
for the Wei@@ dez@@ aun@@ ay project in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 pitches , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway .
the conservation area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 12@@ ,000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump enters the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olog@@ ues of the Tr@@ ump Regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated quar@@ rel with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals to dras@@ tically restric@@ ting legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
but he picked up their meaning , and in particular the importance that was attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is obj@@ ectively correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about contemporary resonance to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely , / the el@@ event@@ h apost@@ asy of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; el@@ event@@ h apost@@ asy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not commit himself in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they performed a highly political action .
the sculpture should show links between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a commonly used classical depic@@ tion .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a disa@@ strous attack on American n@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue , people wanted to change this from the right wing for a long time .
the great cry R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes on .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch will not enligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the significance of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , afflicted , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and this , of course , is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to acknowledge .
their torch will not light the path , but ign@@ ite the hatred which is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Scot@@ s@@ men belonged to the Great Britain team
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland has developed something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK have to learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m route , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally included were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world champi@@ onships in the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Scot@@ s@@ men are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
it will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch after a great season that included the victory of the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champi@@ onships as the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their fellow coun@@ try@@ men do not only belong to the team , but in some cases they will also join the med@@ als and the fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about this team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ate voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes , who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums .
as far as my speech is concerned as a captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic stadium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and there will be just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the heat @-@ up of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long before the newspapers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to its political principles .
he kno@@ cked on the criticism , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work on being more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union therefore accused him of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary hot head .
he has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and rigor@@ ous adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to bust his hair @-@ less head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of individuals who come to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Hos@@ gans Spe@@ aker Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who are sw@@ inging the whi@@ p online .
the mail spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and non @-@ prof@@ ane .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not crowded , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject , and they are regarded by some rather as a so @-@ called collective employment and are not recognized as a large group of citizens affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff designated as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical disgu@@ ises or to arrest or sil@@ enced demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digitally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County has injured First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable port had a similar effect on the internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters ki@@ cked off his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions .
peti@@ tions critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , commerce and shipping with Britain , over@@ came his ministry , according to historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true guidance means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which last year led to Arch@@ er@@ field links to the final round before he lost to Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state .
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set up this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the English E@@ ales is looking forward to defending champi@@ onships for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels particularly good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from the past year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who returned to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to his home ground .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about how far this happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer by passive smoking
in the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
researchers at the Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf University Hospital ( U@@ KE ) are coming to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , there are 167 lung cancer deaths per year due to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew his own study on this topic from 1994 .
at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
land@@ marks prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in the time , &quot; said the head of the station Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than assumed , since there is a lot of mountains in the underground , which is not recorded in the plans .
traffic , which again and again hin@@ ders construction work , is a major problem for the construction company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and shut@@ ters is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p company have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were already very exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the troubled Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally referred to as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , such as clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
the youngest of the four wives of her husband were assigned no fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous late to work : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; no one dar@@ es to walk around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote for a public raising in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially split into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea comprised the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transport .
the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences and made of corrugated sheets , which were converted by rust into different yel@@ low@@ ish brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans rever@@ ed a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her light coat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has reduced its value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources worth $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for Pap@@ ua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 in a single officer .
Pap@@ ua claims for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tribal state in the 1970 &quot; s have been genocide in accordance with the United Nations Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simulate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report by the dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e in 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electro@@ pl@@ uses are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased because Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is too 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes since Muslim economic migrants come from the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra , and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people are fighting to stop here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants have begun selling h@@ ens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Pap@@ ua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai indigenous who went to work in the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has ta@@ sted the native Pap@@ ua - Mama @-@ Mama &#91; women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 , the Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ov@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , only two months after Jok@@ ov@@ is &apos;s inauguration , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers participated in their tone and later returned with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their ri@@ f@@ le pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ uli@@ anus , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby Government Commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and led the orph@@ an@@ ita dance - continuously and im@@ it@@ ating a bird song - from Pap@@ ua &apos;s Me@@ e P@@ ago strain .
some demonstr@@ ators started tow@@ ing stones to police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , an internal radio command was sent to the soldiers : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego k@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , suddenly I was shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his brigh@@ tly painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who has fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , who witnessed the sho@@ ot@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ane , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only carries a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , told repor@@ ters that his officers would only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because it was attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings only occurred the following day &quot; filtered &quot; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ov@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it will not happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Minister of Security Wi@@ ran@@ to said that he will establish an extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we are committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must be under@@ gone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to , accused by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; demanding more than 1,000 victims of death in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua have already been included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such alleg@@ ations with gri@@ m dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the past three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ ane . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a building company , who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting on the crowd and killed one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the TI@@ ME . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon the officers to take account of the police and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an inv@@ ocation of the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal @-@ related Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by raising spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders came from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty boo@@ sts dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over the course of time economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the local Pap@@ ua and the new immigrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire .
the few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better educated and more prosper@@ ous migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own businesses competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Go@@ bai , the chairman of the tribal head of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given the rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting in order to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ troubled eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to Pap@@ ua &apos;s immediate neighbours .
in March six Pacific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ ones - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai Sho@@ oting .
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but Pap@@ ua is likely not to vote for Jok@@ ov@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Go@@ bai , the chairman of the tribal stock .
he wants that Jok@@ ov@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Go@@ bai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite threats and intim@@ id@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shot victims resulted in a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried on a site right opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never give justice to them , but at least they do not forget their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
on Friday , a fire took place in one of the highest living towers of the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in only two years , that one accidentally calls the Tor@@ ch Tower ( torch tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; a resident told his name as George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units extingu@@ ished the fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) and cooled down the building .
the government said they are working on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can resur@@ rec@@ t questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from facing , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation came .
in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding at the London &apos;s Gren@@ fell tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has passed through his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposed for this sport was to play a revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two winning sets , thin not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the five @-@ set classic , which is often very long but also very much appreciated , will therefore remain the tradition of tradition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not until the vote that after many contradictions , the proposal had already come to pass the final on a neutral place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the following year in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs for the organis@@ ers , the requirements regarding training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to do less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden objects to the aircraft , finds out a survey
a survey among flying passengers found that more than 20 percent deliber@@ ate or un@@ consciously forbidden objects passed by the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent of them entering the plane while they accidentally wore forbidden knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered bel@@ ated that they had mistakenly travelled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey for more than 1,000 people , carried out by a Jet @-@ Charter Service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers are more likely to dis@@ regard the rules .
of the respon@@ dents who admitted they were know@@ ingly trying to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als were compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X .
the most common objects that have been deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent said that items with blades were know@@ ingly carried through security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents confirmed that they had intentionally brought forbidden drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it consul@@ ted travelers throughout the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently brought s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers through airport security and how many had intentionally done it .
it is no surprise that people who are most s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - wear the security , those who fly most frequently .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complex and conf@@ using .
people are often uncertain about what fluids they are allowed to take or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while the people thought that T@@ SA could consider books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is happy to announce the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he has under@@ min@@ ed that a part of the customers has already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the constantly trium@@ phant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed another , less gl@@ amor@@ ous number in announc@@ ing the recent quar@@ terly balance : the cancell@@ ations made in the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k has often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins .
now Mus@@ k is dre@@ aming of : 6@@ 3.000 re@@ orders have already been withdrawn from the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la is paying the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1,000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are currently taking place , de@@ fied Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
its argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models will be combined - 500@@ ,000 will be one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1,@@ 800 reservations are made per day .
whoever orders a Model 3 today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new production lines never tested in practice without major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if there are major delays , then the non @-@ binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ cont@@ ented customers from running away in flocks .
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to the delay of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after he had been su@@ ed by 15 states Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the environmental protection authority , took back his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of App@@ eal .
it is a deadline for States to meet on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt declared that he would delay the observ@@ ance for a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or ham@@ per@@ ing economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulations on the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ ff regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of App@@ eal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that its revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EP@@ O to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with the dead@@ lines for implementation and then waited to be accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement set the date for its implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the EPA &apos;s opinion said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress urge a more comprehensive revision of the o@@ zone rules .
a draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been set up in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states that had accused the EPA this week , said the Group intended to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York included California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the emerging smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and every year can contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered about P@@ ru@@ ff &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ our celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July at 4.@@ 30 pm .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius system is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of tum@@ ours .
Walter Mart@@ ini stressed : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische text@@ book : &quot; count Hermann von Sul@@ z &quot; sold the mountain to the parish church of Tum@@ our , with the Vog@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wording of the document , on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a splendid courtyard , to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age was one and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the district Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the village picture of Tum@@ lings , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the splendid settlement nucle@@ us of the village .
old maps from the period around 1600 are subject to these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval alle@@ y@@ way .
a master who built a church and occupied it with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath this church .
associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two was broken on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed out later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 , French troops camped near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the cemetery of Hil@@ arius also served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing @-@ silence .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the church was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower was left .
in the New Year night in 18@@ 34 a storm split the church tower and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the existing tower of Turin still existed as a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius system as successor to Dieter D@@ ock@@ horn .
the organis@@ ers invite friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , 16 July to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
the pre@@ face is Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is available from 3 : 30 p.m .
to conclude the ser@@ en@@ ade , a refresh@@ ment takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers put out the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of great importance for tum@@ ors and listeners .
the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to their home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to let approval of wind turbines be checked
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the coun@@ cil@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has asked Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 there were no wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , since at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind force concentration zone at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time , the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
such zones are intended to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to change the land use plan a second wind power conc@@ entri@@ c zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette - but that had not authorized the district government of Düsseldorf because of a form@@ id@@ able defect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval decision is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to be accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; approval by the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the granting of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been received by the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them on the occasion to examine the matter again .
however , they probably do not cause the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the argument of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build four hundred metres high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
already last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 @-@ hectare site .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - this corresponds to around one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ million households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was wounded in death .
two more people were injured slightly .
the state road was closed for hours .
according to police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch came with her car in the course of the accompanying driving with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and merchants plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ ei@@ a@@ er and people from the region will discover the shopping opportunities in the city center .
the commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to enti@@ ce the inhabitants to the shopping spre@@ e in the city center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hom@@ eland Sh@@ oppen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weekend will sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers the own city provides apart from the usual supermarket goods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their apprentices@@ hip places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action is aimed not only on residents of the city and the region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als are on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , so Christian König .
city administration and business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
this makes the commercial association and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive City . &quot;
these include new offerings such as the first &quot; active day &quot; for the well @-@ being and sale of Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ people and hosts , in order to move them to active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the aband@@ on@@ ment of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be newly opened or re @-@ opened .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city centre when shopping .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the city center - up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole town and clubs .
it was a matter of overcoming the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which made themselves partly broad@@ ly , had said King in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Mühl@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day was the first time to take part in five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities for the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is the Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the I@@ HK and its many partners makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his buying behaviour .

a first missing was later also found dead .
among the dead things were employees of the school .
as a matter of fact , the authorities assumed working on a gas pipeline .
at the holiday season , only a few people stayed in the building of the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy .
dump replaced after le@@ aked tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the limit wall
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump entered into a telephone with Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian prime minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid , &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration would let him look like a &quot; dump &quot; after he proposed a ban on res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he said Mr. Turn@@ bull saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists lead to ra@@ cial ly@@ n@@ ch act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of viewers in the Mon@@ roe country , Georgia , and moved to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , was able to reach the bridge , a group of white men stood out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors , the occup@@ ants were floating in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams broke the silence when a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger seat .
luckily this terrible scene played on July 22nd , is just a pos@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience beat very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 civil rights activists have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to mim@@ ic the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were hoo@@ ked up by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever indic@@ ted for the kill@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years , no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps organizing the post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that an injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must preserve justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bai@@ li@@ ff lays a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore Ford Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 Mon@@ roe men and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching process .
but no one has ever been indic@@ ted .
although the susp@@ ects remain free on foot for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Georgia enabled the black citizens to vote for their vote for the first time in the summer elections .
approximately at the same time as the election stab@@ bed Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , like the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they got closer to the prison and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and arranged the mur@@ ders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local criminal prosecution that was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law@@ suit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has headed the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even harder to watch , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ ching because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest bl@@ acks - got into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ens Co @-@ Director .
he has played the role of the chief @-@ cl@@ an member for many years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , tried their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the ne@@ sts scre@@ aming and ur@@ ges him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , win@@ ch from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona respon@@ ds to the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t believe white people at that time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ i@@ onship is replacing the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .
the scene begins again .
this time when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with emphasis .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are cri@@ es , shots , and then silence .
a woman , dressed with a mour@@ ning dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays in mour@@ ning glory &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen people wi@@ pes sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture for almost eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when one stands in the same country where the ly@@ n@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the cor@@ p@@ se .
children ho@@ cking in their heads , record the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy as if he wants to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thank@@ ed the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ cord and wipe their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw surrounded Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the cl@@ an member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then collap@@ ses in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done that for one reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience joined together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white couple from Atlanta talked about the pos@@ ing with a black couple that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words that left a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do this because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does to me makes me believe that Lyn@@ ching continues to go on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone &apos;s farm holds Broo@@ ks &apos;s court at his table , he eats and rec@@ alls the civil rights .
he said he already started to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demand is inspiring in a way , because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who do not study their own history , who do not know their own history , are condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ an in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf is setting up a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging in front of gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by A@@ lek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows optionally a street corner with wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ bar &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes @-@ Old@@ timer is par@@ ked in which the Rhein@@ Bann@@ ers pose as a rock @-@ ergi@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
pil@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ mo@@ tiv - money , power and gre@@ ed - which is attracted by his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three Rhine bra@@ ins - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise wonderfully as in &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
K@@ ES@@ S seduc@@ es Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , tore a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ style and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen , which surrounds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brut@@ ally the scene when Siegfried breaks down Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) still has to believe in it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ my , forming a humble and humble way to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is great applause for the Fest@@ spiel@@ orchester , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothes .
the performance was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
in 2013 , when he had to leave a tro@@ t concert in 2013 , there were five years later a great jubil@@ ation in which the isolated &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; rep@@ ut@@ ations went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner should have been happy about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of his view .
I prefer a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in the einf@@ urt in the furniture exchange , once a week I help out here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school in the open full day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ called volunteer .
how does it come ?
lot : I did Ab@@ itur .
and then a degree of civil engineering , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
I know for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something different to work with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
do a social year , as there is an insight , you can see how it is on the spot , in the focal point maybe also , really .
and was it like that ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system during the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably make a social worker education in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different places during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you make your FS@@ J .
it can be done from old people to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon supervision .
for me it was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works out .
in a different way than in civil engineering ?
a lot : sure , here it &apos;s not about to calculate star@@ ches .
one has again and again other people in front of each other , who have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee or a teen@@ ager has been taken out of the family - you must always respond to it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no fear of touch ?
amount : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is so .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure on which the company is facing .
the job reduction , which CEO John Fall@@ on mainly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 positions have already been lost .
Pear@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May in a third cost @-@ cutting program to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to Ber@@ tel@@ smann &apos;s partner , said that the outlook for the financial year is unchanged , after an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul Con@@ vo@@ y attack : NATO @-@ soldier killed in suicide bom@@ b@@ ings
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in Kab@@ ul , Afghanistan , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , a NATO Declaration .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a Nato statement it is said that the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint pat@@ rol was attacked with the Afgh@@ an army by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated at the Air@@ field Bag@@ ram in the US military hospital .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July a suicide car event killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had done this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country since the US @-@ led troops forced the Tali@@ ban from power in 2001 .
violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump sums up the number of U.S. troops that support military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and , in particular , the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule to suits
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , aboli@@ shing that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zone Reg@@ ulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said they are showing the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intent of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which in some part of the country pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured to determine where cuts have to be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tr@@ ump should spur economic growth .
however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of the Democrats and nature conservation groups concerned about the effects of major emissions on public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; EPA &apos;s website says that breathing air , which contains o@@ zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
municipal council wants community space
in the end , the decision was clear : in the case of two opposing voices , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Wind decides on the establishment of a community room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing piece of land is signed , mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden reports .
it will take a long time until the area belonging to the church community is still in the hands of the municipality , but there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a community space for that .
one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the Administration and the majority of the Municipal Council pre@@ tend not to fores@@ ee such a common room as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ iors @-@ just residence , but openly into the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision to be made by means of the provision of funds for the current household has already been decided in the past fall by means of funding opportunities .
the building is located in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common area would be , as reported by T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposal looks to indicate the investor that one does not want to throw a bil@@ let between the legs in this respect , the finding that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the environment - as well as pitch roof - which would reduce the height of the tr@@ ump and make the construction more economical - possible .
unnecessary , so does not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this additive .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the body .
it &apos;s not that easy with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many of her own buildings , with which one does not get so much forward , but now you lean towards the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind it a hidden subsi@@ dy of any wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , as with the acquisition of the area , there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real counter @-@ value that is market@@ able in doubt , the counter @-@ speech is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ ig@@ er &apos;s request to ple@@ ad the proposal will find three advoc@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the case with two opposing voices in the original programme , which Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we hold the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with Auto : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath was captured by a car and badly injured .
as the police told us , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling with his bike on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from Hil@@ den on the way .
the Senior wanted to cross the road at the altitude of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction gave him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving on the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the opposite traffic .
he met with a car that headed a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the road .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ch carriage .
Bayern Munich must ab@@ stain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup runs without him : David Al@@ aba has to leave the game against Dortmund .
with personnel worries the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 a.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , personnel care at the German football record champion Bayern Munich is getting bigger and bigger .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to go to David Al@@ aba in the du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
in addition , the Munich @-@ based Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six trials , An@@ cel@@ otti did the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is expecting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
walking in the resin from star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created in the resin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accommo@@ dates the information needs of many visitors , was it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
in the first phase up to 2018 , the association plans &quot; well at@@ tain@@ able installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be supplemented by internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the train will be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ trail , the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is stronger than another , even though it lies much further away .
in which con@@ stellation you can find a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the location in the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye are clearly visible .
since 2003 , at the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there has been something similar to the planned star@@ base - the planet route since 2003 .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; off @-@ planet &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the dem@@ ol@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the Earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ metres in diameter while the sun is exactly 75 meters away and measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance from the planet is about four kilometres .
while the light of sun is needed up to Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to reach the booth with Plu@@ to .
therefore , pedestri@@ ans are faster than light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fixed star would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down the hall@@ way to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko to the World Bo@@ xing Organization Super spring weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
Gar@@ cia put out his right hand and said : &quot; how are you , champion ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko is defending his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas re@@ marked that a potential show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a past spring weight &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Gar@@ cia rec@@ alled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I climbed up for Bron@@ s &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big .
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I would like to come down on a light weight .
and he must move on light weight plates &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans ask .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
climate asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year in order to make a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also took interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light weight title fight in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans have asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and later insist@@ ed on struggling with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he treasure Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday struggle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko listened to Gar@@ cia with the generous praise and said that he thinks the three combat champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slow , I &apos;m sorry for Mi@@ key ... you wanted the K@@ o @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that the focus is to show stro@@ kes , then boxes .
they both said that they could sense the momentum that was built for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that needs to be done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injured after tire plat@@ ters
four people were seriously injured in an accident on the A@@ 7 on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the connection .
the car dropped to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction of the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; tri@@ cycle works better &quot;
after 2 : 2 , and@@ re Hoffmann hopes for the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig that optim@@ ising the defensive formation leads to Au@@ e points .
with the first round of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result even if not the two opponents were at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was too much for two opponents , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una Du@@ essel@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain should also be further optimized .
and the For@@ tun@@ en don &apos;t want to catch a gate after a break .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more than Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the three @-@ chain preparation , than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I still don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just in the three @-@ chain at the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Fo@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , but that we do better harmon@@ ise and we don &apos;t make so many mistakes in building up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann too moves to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a mis@@ sl@@ ited start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are at four points on Sunday and can focus on poker , we will certainly be able to talk about a ti@@ dy season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know anything about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped pre@@ matur@@ ely because of a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season practically with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might be even a bit fres@@ her , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game such as Fort@@ una against a favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know exactly where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the internal defender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland are going to be a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep it away , just because we are entitled to come under the first six , is stupid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga which must be beaten in advance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Chef@@ cha@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to make such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ old application tests published
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who underwent a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Agency for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Rä@@ t@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun with the implementation of the tests last year .
they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Department ( Mig@@ ration@@ verk@@ et ) has been critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were of minor age .
the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has judged that the person &quot; possibly was 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years of age . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are steady in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases judged by the person over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she found that in 243 of these cases the person said openly that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , when X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans , to see if they usually went through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency advoc@@ ated the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the works on the three bridges of Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven ton concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the Department of Traffic and Transport at the Regier@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three refur@@ bish@@ ment bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building end is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be respected .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch bridge made of concrete covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to guarantee stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated .
the two other bridges run across the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning has now received a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven ton heavy so @-@ called bridge valve on Wednesday morning on the northern side .
this is a border fast@@ ener that is also used as a way of operation .
on the southern part of the bridge a 2,@@ 20 meter wide bridge entrance is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian path is to run .
the special thing about this is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip @-@ feeling has required the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the works .
in addition , fish and cr@@ abs had to be f@@ ished first .
for bridges between the building yard and the con@@ glomer@@ ation towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by traffic lights .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed .
the cost of the three bridges is 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ low@@ ish Protest at German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to get under a hat .
the parties represented in the circle of volcanic Eifel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance , which shows a peaceful flag this day , because the Af@@ D invites the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell to the &quot; great election campaign . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the parliamentary elections on September 24 , and the deputy president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D developers but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel is colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally planned the city picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well place , but now takes place on the parking place underneath the R@@ ond@@ elles - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , president of the Forum A World and one of the author@@ itative organizers , is really happy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ur@@ german potato salad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which could eat the Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence mainly at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Mar@@ pes reports about the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel , he tried for such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a refusal , because there were not enough parking spaces available due to the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , gay is happy that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also done : at about 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the round@@ about , in the Stad@@ thalle there are various speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D Chairman Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 listeners who are waiting for the leading candidate for the election of the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch held their speeches .
the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is a short time after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can move - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher tro@@ mb@@ on@@ ist Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ Concer@@ tos tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
this is how Pet@@ kov is solo trump@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ is the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both combines the desire to not only cross the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different genres .
thus Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new robe , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ rei@@ str@@ ass N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and the free play blend into a fascinating art work .
this core of the program was first performed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart speaks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly spoke about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt with bitter@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brunette Dar@@ stell@@ erin ass@@ ures the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously in love with whom I dat@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;ve played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; was particularly popular among them , but in school age , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven I told me the children , I would look like a boy .
I felt really attacked , frigh@@ tened and embarrass@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public does not like to declare their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to relate to a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and maybe some people call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like having to justify myself before all the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening in a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a coach I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states and inherited coal from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the change of party from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party , which would rather prevent us from working to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the f@@ ew@@ est legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , in@@ conclu@@ sive message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC chair@@ woman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised what he described as a manifest excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sport again .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF conference on the eve of the athle@@ tics world champi@@ onships that the exile of his country from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were caught away with gold and silver med@@ als at competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress backed the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized by itself that it has experienced some quite hot days and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for his re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that it is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do anything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world champi@@ onships , which begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the leader of the IA@@ AF task force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
funeral act for soldiers crashed in Mali
during a funeral service in the northern h@@ ess@@ ische F@@ ritz@@ lar , about 1000 people of the two killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety precau@@ tions .
the Minister of Defence Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the still un@@ resolved issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but they described the two fallen pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ön@@ ners of their trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Chief of Staff of Nord@@ h@@ essen had come to life in Mali on Wednesday a week ago .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
at noon , only the members of the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , the closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr , as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Premier Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the mour@@ ners laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
before the church , F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a sat@@ anic journey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann constructed the flight operation of the fighter helicopter Tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment , to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubts about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of Le@@ yen , did not show that deployment was dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death .
this divided the Royal House on Thursday .
the Danish royal couple is traditionally included in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s Cathedral .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision to continue her announcement .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to be king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he retired in 2016 and also called the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince &apos;s Su@@ pper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish Royal House .
where the last resting place of the 83 year old will eventually be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ ratic family , met in London .
at the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympathy of the people was always imp@@ ec@@ cable , Prince Hen@@ rik held a heavy stand in the Dan@@ es under the 50 @-@ year reign of the Dan@@ es .
Hen@@ rik wrote in an auto@@ biography about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who in this country had the call to be the brand of anti @-@ society intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two faults ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants to quickly re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of a possible majority in Lower Saxony
Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the parliament , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was because on Friday the resolution of the parliament was expressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to that , the surprising exit of a Gre@@ ens party in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its tight one @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green party El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) in 2018 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U Group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ümm@@ ler wants to recommend his group to record it .
as a result , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the parliament of Lower Saxony , SPD and Green 68 seats .
up to now , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected as regular on the 14th of January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ um@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether or not they can continue to rule in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag as soon as possible decides its self @-@ dissolution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state constitution also provides the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s Parliament withdraw@@ s trust and sel@@ ects a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be insp@@ ected legally clean , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ um@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ um@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens &quot; step &quot; but something strange . &quot;

the Gre@@ ens called for the apost@@ ate de@@ pu@@ ties to return their country &apos;s mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume , of course , that it returns its agricultural mandate which it has received via the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she deliberately decided not to pron@@ ounce any pron@@ unciation in the Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also against the background that there were no substan@@ tive differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor , Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green Party from El@@ ke T@@ jackets to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the German Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Land@@ tag .
the leaving of T@@ west@@ ens costs the majority of Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous vanity and in her fru@@ stration &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty game of intri@@ gue and tries to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

agriculture ministers in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from po@@ isons , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from contaminated eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to watch the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery @-@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states present the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to all we currently know , a health risk is practically excluded .
is Al@@ di taking the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of the educ@@ ator is not really noticed by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has immediately turned on and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the affected state of Germany .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
the trade has as well as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are safe and harmless to health .
if the residual water content of 0.00@@ 5 mg / kg is exceeded , they are not able to transport .
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the farms are not to blame .
do production companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the state of knowledge , the production plants are not directly responsible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , they have to anticipate economic damage due to alleged illegal practices of service companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always , there is too little control in the appointment .
is there no lack of staff or a conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that revealed the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out to 100 percent .
this is precisely why a consistent enligh@@ tenment of such events and the transfer to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can be present are of decisive importance .
I have already made it clear that I am expecting a complete enligh@@ tenment by the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm system really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to get only safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged .
the ph@@ ased means are manufacturers , traders and consumers into a situation which is absolutely not necessary .
in principle it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food@@ borne animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
at all levels it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect all responsible authorities that the facts are quickly and completely enligh@@ tened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the financial rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imped@@ ed expendi@@ tures of the European football clubs will not interfere with N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the guiding organisation controlling the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G must eventually prove that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can make money loose with security so that N@@ ey@@ mar writes down and bring him into a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy @-@ rich ruling family of Qatar .
associations are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but must be subject to legitimate income sources allowing them to reach the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had huge debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ated and ris@@ ked to ruin when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration on the debt of clubs to monitoring their losses .
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder business .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P distribution period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ idency in 2015 , the UEF@@ A successor A@@ lek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to dis@@ courage herself from excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we are going to rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G pays the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the revenues for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was reduced to 20 million euros later - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wi@@ t their financial supervision by infl@@ ating revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a European company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing was to exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate revenues .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the sponsor@@ ship of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments made by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s WM will be ambassador and that such maneu@@ ver could be easy to find out for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to ignore any attempt to b@@ ypass the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , announced on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they discussed the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing dealers , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales .
the association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signing the contract .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ar@@ senal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finan@@ ces a club .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the overall landscape of the football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because there are different ways or can have different interests if a country has such a large player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new og@@ rant supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Board chocolate has made board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation prev@@ ails in front of a possible end : the airline recently re@@ jects the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request by the news agency s@@ da an appropriate report of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be insp@@ ected every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very happy with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 17 million small red @-@ white packaged j@@ og@@ g@@ ings of 14 grams are distributed per year the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer .
as many applicants present at the new tender , the Swiss will not want to betra@@ y .
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y hopes to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment .
the Swiss chocolate bars distributed the Swiss since 2006 on board of their flights .
before signing a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter Barry Cal@@ le@@ baut had supplied chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the opportunity to place the logo was introduced two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights the customers of the First Class are spoiled by the conf@@ is@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class n@@ ags passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y will also be distributed on the short course , both in Business and Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for itself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd walked to larger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels as if time was scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained a original story for talking notes of vegetables spoken by H. J@@ on Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by getting into the core of the ga@@ g - middle aged actors play hor@@ ny kids who are grown up - they nevertheless managed to recover the last part of the weather .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emo@@ tionally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more according to the principle of watering , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s @-@ years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character sticks through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has never forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( K@@ en Marino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy evil plot involved in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ known impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ on &apos;s Unter@@ li@@ ppen@@ bart of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former big @-@ man @-@ on @-@ camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker .
it is the moments of accidental ma@@ dness that could heat this fran@@ chise as a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I think of as its logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band how it will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon re@@ members another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ to @-@ west ring combat icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard boiled Greg@@ or and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are du@@ b@@ bed in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on television , as Americans perhaps do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desp@@ airing propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
in six long episodes , it moves away , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was reduced to a lower length , could better deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Greg@@ or and I@@ os@@ ef regularly visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imagined communist public is that Western culture can make everything a fo@@ dder for a ban@@ age .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own recent history and thei@@ rs .
strike against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in winning against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office announced on Friday .
15 accused were arrested between the ages of 25 and 77 , and arrest warran@@ ts were issued against them .
in addition , the officers secured large amounts of mar@@ ihu@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
in the case of simultaneous ra@@ ids in Italy , two persons were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two are therefore presumably delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators took part in the action .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised crime of drugs , violent acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Kon@@ stanz has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , a lively exchange and investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the Grand Master was also accompanied by four officers from Palermo .
the aim of the investigation was mainly Italian citizens with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired in a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
way lam@@ ents large gaps in the foreig@@ ner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not come up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the national register of foreigners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned them in an analysis that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data , ten million people with foreign nation@@ alities are reported in the register , including about 5.@@ 7 million non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by some 600 foreign nation@@ als in Germany .
because the data were not adequately maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data were found in 1921 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive or citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the Register any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data entries can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also included , who would not have to travel at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false al@@ ign@@ ments led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distorted debate on dealing with tax@@ pay@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families back to Italy under 16 years of age , when they have travelled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in paper it says that BA@@ MF is introducing such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper has been referring to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state they reach first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a immig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country of entry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back there within the framework of the Dublin agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic political spokes@@ woman of the Left Opposition in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children thre@@ aten un@@ lawful detention conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach have already provided the blood donation service for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now distributed 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations in the meantime .
traditionally , in the meeting of the municipal council , the congregation acknowled@@ ges the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome how our body is designed for it and we appl@@ aud the don@@ ors that make their blood available to strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the regional leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , for cann@@ ed cann@@ ons are broken down into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus three persons could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported of the actions performed in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K district manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the change to the theatre house obviously led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry returned to the multi @-@ don@@ or and were awarded for 50 blood donations .
half as many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ oth@@ ee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter donated ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their juice .
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England will probably announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members striving for an increase in this month since weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.6 % and warned that pressure on budget@@ ary income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but it sign@@ alled that in the next few years , interest rates would be necessary in order to rein the inflation induced by Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the M@@ amm@@ oth economic stimulus package issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of February next , although it has been said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the scope of this system - with £ 115 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice as the pressure on the real income of households will continue to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; scale than the markets expect .
the markets currently forecast the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
the bank noted , however , that increases were &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts downward for this and next year are compared with the 1.@@ 9 % and 1.7 % forecast forecast in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change occurs after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened rising expectations for an increase in interest , and GDP has risen to 0.3 % in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is likely to recover after the end of the year .
the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by increasing inflation and minor increase in wages , as the sharpen@@ ing becomes worse first before it becomes better .
she added that monetary policy could not &quot; prevent &quot; income from income in the coming years , but she added that the wages to the end of her three @-@ year forecast will &quot; clearly &quot; recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which will offset some of the lower consumption expenditure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the shock@@ ing EU vote causing the fall of the soil .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until it will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call rose after an increase in interest , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said it was expected and will attract it back in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the exceeding in proportion to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent down@@ turn of the swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market should be more competitive again , as credi@@ tors are lou@@ dly looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages finish , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight against the High Court in September following a fight against the High Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ text pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic ( pre@@ p ) taken prior to sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by the health service on a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the App@@ eals Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year that the N@@ HS had the power to pay for the pre@@ p despite the alleg@@ ation that the local authorities should finance it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National A@@ ids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; crucial moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a sequence of HIV medicines that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection @-@ prone areas .
to take pre@@ p before intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and persons with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , appropriate atten@@ de@@ es will be identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program is signed at £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to evaluate the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence as it is used on a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National A@@ ids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if it is targeted specifically for vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded trial in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on H@@ od@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ health minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as a part of our approach to HIV prevention and termin@@ ate the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect individuals who are HIV @-@ infected and that they will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living the Great Life : mezzanine and clever designer @-@ tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , shr@@ ank in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne hasn &apos;t packed and sold her bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ anne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something similar to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne Storage and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function at the top or bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement made it possible for Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to let it work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little engineering art went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important , so that when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious benefit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and increased square footage of some standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a dispute because of one of the biggest real estate Imperial Victoria worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football @-@ Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers possess 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
there the West@@ co family founded je@@ ans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - von Paul described as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul , about one third .
a court file states that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 316 million and Paul worth EUR 176 million .
the breakdown of real estate and cash has proved to be a major issue for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reviews proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first case in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first court hear@@ ings of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now also struggle for control of the existing business - what Col@@ in , like Paul claims , has excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul to in@@ competent manage some possessions .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and law firms held by both parties .
wife De Lu@@ tis and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they took advantage of the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Property in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans of the family .
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before the court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , where Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid $ 10 million on leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in with@@ held himself very well , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of television stars in 2015 .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS , in order to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is in front of the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and to take our family name by the dishes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current quar@@ rel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps of new chief of staff plans to limit the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive staff on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House that he wanted to fix : bad information that fell into the hands of the President .
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring his media device .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship to television is decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry because of unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February in front of Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter habit under control , according to six ex @-@ election officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter habit was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials do not know what we others don &apos;t know - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets would have included even more combus@@ ti@@ bles without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump did not send .
if his associates manage to keep away from him a few times , their efforts have paid off .
but no one has consistently been able to prevent Tr@@ ump Contro@@ versy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , which are composed of competing parties , try again and again to present their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump Material that possibly promotes their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ors to lead the president for strategic reasons doub@@ t@@ ful information .
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press releases , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he tries to figure out where they came from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously accused a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur , Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
while Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for sh@@ kan@@ es , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false alleg@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump was reading the article and started asking staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paper@@ work and to document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly tried three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove himself more effective as a pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his consultants are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped for .
the police all over Europe send ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals in this summer .
since the addresses of the searched seriously criminals are not known naturally , information from the population is hoped and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experience showed that many volati@@ les were hiding on holiday destinations , it was said by Euro@@ pol .
21 post@@ cards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries have been put together .
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ eal , which has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online requests could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them based on refer@@ ral after publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire &apos; series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some determined travellers on the foot of the war , who have negotiated a dit@@ ch drawn by the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a wealthy street called Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were ki@@ cked out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dig@@ ging from the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense posts and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have supp@@ ressed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous resident said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by .
the Council has to be forced into action by means of shame as it was useless when dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council can &apos;t even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local residents who did not want to be called said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the figures have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as soon as possible .
in order to support our evidence , it is very important that as many local residents report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by invo@@ king 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we lay down our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
made from Birken@@ hof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made up of the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the hotel Birken@@ hof by the then Ambiente operating company mbH on April 13 , 2014 , approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and revenue from the local tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of dramatically rising numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered to the district council as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the territory as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the municipal council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house at that time .
he should be right .
the former Hotel Birken@@ hof has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt @-@ Object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
they are named Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof there have been building sh@@ utt@@ ings in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear how extensive renov@@ ations are carried out .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and meeting room belong to the facilities .
one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a higher downtown level , Sch@@ erer stresses .
Sch@@ erer further explains the Lu@@ ise Wald@@ hotel with its 60 rooms .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or bus@@ ines@@ spe@@ ople are to feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already led talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourist Director Michael Kr@@ ause , Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
according to the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly .
almost under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the outside comple@@ xes are also brought to the fore , which is already clearly visible .
there is a large terrace in a courtyard which will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : us Special Agent sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the past weeks , the panel recorded the work , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on appeal to persons entrusted to the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensified its investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ ca@@ ster reported that there are already first invitations to the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to have pur@@ pos@@ efully interven@@ ed in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , several men are said to have acted as advis@@ ers of the re@@ public@@ ans during the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took a closer look at more and more tr@@ um@@ ps in a private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote several weeks ago that the special issu@@ er Tr@@ ump was personally involved in the center and to submit the accus@@ ation whether the President may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to check present evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether they want to be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called anchor chambers .
usually they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor in order to invite persons to be carried out under oath .
according to CN@@ N , invitations were issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who participated in the meeting were called to a statement , it was stated in the report .
they should also provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. were also Tr@@ um@@ ps advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his team Princip@@ al Paul Man@@ a@@ fort at the interview .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the institution shows that Mu@@ eller does not let himself be intim@@ id@@ ated in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly .
but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charging of an indictment .
nevertheless , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the president used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the history of Russia is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the Democrats an opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but he usually works in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that accelerated the work of the special intermedi@@ ary in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FB@@ I chief James Com@@ ey said three times that it was not determined against the president .
there is no reason to assume that something has changed in this way , it was said in the declaration .
however , Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this draft , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have been loud , and have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey testified in June of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up investigations against the then National Security Ad@@ visor Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
according to U.S. media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees .
this triggered spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
unlike an independent special agent of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later @-@ tro@@ dden President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the insist@@ ence of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
but several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a move .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democ@@ rat sen@@ ators proposed legislation on Thursday , after which the special promot@@ er could no longer be dismissed as easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in Western Antar@@ c@@ tica , a giant ic@@ e@@ berg has loos@@ ened from the el@@ event@@ h celebration of the almost seven times the size of Berlin .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , weighing about one tri@@ l@@ lion tonne and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving to the north and will probably need two or three years until it mel@@ ted .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for people .
according to research data , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demoli@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg .
in total , however , for about 30 years there have been a series of unusual clas@@ hes of el@@ ic@@ eber@@ gs in the region , writes the US Research Centre for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ag .
Sch@@ el@@ ven flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
so it grows more and more into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
to the north of this sla@@ p , the balance of growth and ab@@ rupt was disturbed some years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ ude is broken down there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ag is in danger , because the front edge has never pulled so far as it is currently .
in addition , the ice plate is under tension and can decay if a piece is broken down at a key place .
melting of ice cream and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results in the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this may increase sea level , however , only to a small extent , writes the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ude is the fourth biggest vil@@ lain in Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the crossing from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the open ocean some 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural phenomenon and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice sign comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the record began , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ ag is going to grow again or go back in the long run and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said , &quot; Our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if these researchers do not return the demoli@@ tion of this giant ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , there have been very many ice @-@ tu@@ fts of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula in recent decades .
this long tip of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research programme , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the rise in temperature contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med up around three degrees in the past 50 years and is thus counting on the areas in which the temperature is fastest growing .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls on the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , 41 new positions in the administration went through .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 tra@@ inees have their first working day behind them .
the courses in the circle are obviously highly sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places to be distributed this year .
however , the group still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently , there are still 50 vac@@ ant positions in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative in the circle day together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the lack of skilled labour in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management should work out a concept for recruitment and personnel development according to the wishes of the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented evaluation of applicants .
the overall concept should be oriented internally and externally , showing concrete measures for cross @-@ members and involve an education campaign , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems you did not know before .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is by a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a high number of employees who secre@@ te disease or age due to the service .
maximum time for action , so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U group leader , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he recently took care of a f@@ ist surprise when he questioned the costs of human resources and ba@@ ff@@ led the rest of the parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be checked , which enable exit from the communal employers association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice , the county government should strive for a house tari@@ ff with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to pay more attention to employees and officials than envis@@ aging the tari@@ ff bill for the public service .
sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money exist only if you change to a higher level oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be established in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law .
last but not least because of the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and district director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone on NGO migrants &apos; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said interior minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ re@@ eds &apos; because their team had effectively worked with human hands in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express itself in the detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in a statement on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all alleg@@ ations that are currently being collected after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Save &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is presum@@ ed that its crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which will be delivered to them directly by human hands , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of putting aside the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , above all , have to have an Italian police officer who over@@ sees their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , since they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign up , the Nobel prize winner organisation is doctors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
in the meantime , Minn@@ iti once said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations had declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
climb@@ s and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy trials and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs .
there were three friendly guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the castle and wine festival of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome bonus .
the first tour led to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim during hot summer temperatures .
observation points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were again and again long asc@@ ents , rewar@@ ding for the long trials .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , the look@@ out point at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flo@@ wer@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days a lot of altitude difference was announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ roads brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed in the open air inhal@@ atorium healing Sole .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had become acquainted with the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga cat@@ ers for e @-@ sports
will the sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles , instead of being swe@@ at@@ y through the stage during wind and weather ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high commitments .
the first federal li@@ ga@@ des have also recognised this , which are becoming increasingly involved in this area .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure that some clubs are going up on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen meanwhile advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract it is possible to be more often present on these markets online , than to send the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ ann@@ abe to Asia once a year .
what is it all about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; during E @-@ sport , computer games like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; League Of Legends &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the football simulation FIFA posted on competition level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as in normal sports , li@@ lies have long since become established , in which the pro@@ s compete against each other .
and in 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the performance is most likely to get used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ose has long dealt with the question .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions , which are also found in classic sport - for example increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console , but also their body and watch for nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls should be elu@@ sive when playing online , and in the scene the structures of the classic sport were missing .
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative impact of e @-@ sport .
the players are internationally on the move , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study by the Corporate Advisory Board Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts the rapid growth of e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years sales are expected to be 130 million .
that is little against the barely 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte coun@@ sell@@ ors write . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many countries are already on the move . &quot; &quot; &quot;
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is also a lot happening in Europe .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a lesson , says F@@ rob@@ atic .
according to D@@ utt , the football league clubs in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to establish an e @-@ sports division .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany is lag@@ ging behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nostal@@ gia to decay , and to clarify the old times is no longer enough today .
it is about keeping the tradition of the association , but at the same time alig@@ ning the company with the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t keep in mind that everything stays the same with football as it has always been . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the lyrics that Con@@ rad drove to suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were exposed on prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June for a negli@@ gent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to stay free until his appointment .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood up with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and downward @-@ looking eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she did not take responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they absolutely regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge La@@ wr@@ ence Mon@@ iz , however , said he did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said that &quot; there is &quot; no day at which I do not have the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try to be there for eternity with us , in spite of all my pain that we will bear for eternity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the knowledge that she would never attend the wedding of her brother or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more this single person with whom I was together every day since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to impose another , commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead of a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang up , spring from a building , catch yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you &apos;ll be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was taken by Roy &apos;s death and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was condemned in 2007 for murder of her British co @-@ resident in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ i : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ ys a big season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm .
anything was different on his place in the cabin , Joshua saw me immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and broad@@ ly on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er were to be seen , he made the ties to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner after his first deployment as a Bavaria @-@ Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good that could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character of the coach could interpret Kim@@ me as well .
not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game guide from youth players , de@@ but@@ s and just out of holiday professionals , but he .
sugar is distributed preferably to those with a lot of herbs that you want to keep in your mood .
those who were chosen to take the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old came across the field as a mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m .
to the right , this is his position , the white band@@ age at the arm did her rest .
and at all , Kim@@ i made me feel like the one who can take the helm best in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the in@@ filtr@@ ated troops .
he had a look at the whole , while many others were busy with himself .

after all , it worked out quite well .
in addition to Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy escaped from the def@@ ences , both acted confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ appointed Nap@@ oli storm frequently proved difficult , and also Sü@@ le tried a couple of times also in the building of the game .

companies satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises wis@@ sings pace
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ us sees the biggest turning point in infrastructure policy : the gap between the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year the Ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 is expected to be the right place for construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a role in the plans of the country is also played by the West@@ um@@ hus@@ ung Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Highway Plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Minister Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees it as a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier aims to promote a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label with wine , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports being sag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier has an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new Master Bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro for the passed master exam and 2500 euros is planned for graduates within ten years after the master training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
in the planned road construction there are quick facts to create , but at the same time there is no need for the country on the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Trier .
only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to employ Wis@@ sing in the state of mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
the CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf points to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros less than suggested in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a country &apos;s concept to solve the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the current broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey only with the grade 3,@@ 4 .
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ant internet connections and out@@ breaks .
the former Minister of Economy , E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green faction left Lem@@ ke for April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months she already cleared the field for in@@ consist@@ encies .
Audi to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in over 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Group said that the company believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving limits &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des em@@ itting diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of car manufacturers to install systems for the neutr@@ alisation of exhaust gases produced by diesel vehicles also increase what makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with ignor@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
companies try to avoid the faults of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut @-@ off devices which could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions .
in the United States several employees were accused of Volkswagen and others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be put in court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was expanded .
Volkswagen &apos;s involvement in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the benefit of Volkswagen .

if you go back to Is@@ ar on Saturday , you will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building refer@@ ee wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a big information carrier .
it shows a waste mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; is meant to shar@@ pen the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a protected game of wildlife . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and Lau@@ ghter against Su@@ ff@@ ering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most widely publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on characters , the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
even with 85 the Argent@@ inian is still drawing and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laugh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much sorrow in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he , among other things , proposed himself as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greetings cards - which was frustr@@ ated by him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
the artist was repeatedly inspired by cities .
large , round Mor@@ di@@ llo figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits at the drawing table , works almost ten hours a day .
on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his dro@@ ll characters still find a lot of distribution worldwide .
for six years he has also been working on a carto@@ on film and a TV series with his characters .
the protagon@@ ist in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s favourite animal in his drawings - which has a thousand foot@@ er as an opponent .
for the first time , his figures speak in 3D film , which should come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
therefore he relies more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless .
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change Provence
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is dec@@ lining due to the conditions reminiscent of d@@ rought and because of the diseases transmitted by insects , leading scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert in the agricultural research institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years , which in spring has brought much less rain and in autumn a lot more .
this has an impact on the life of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small ci@@ k@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather , there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also spra@@ ying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .
the little town of Gei@@ sa in Thur@@ in@@ gia is celebrating its 1200 year anniversary this year .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff at the weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce normally meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organising crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them home .
security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and gut feelings .
there are drug traffi@@ ckers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s salary list or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses accum@@ ulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to has taken office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; justice , &quot; hangs on the façade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts , who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 , in order to process the cases of journalists , the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists has opened up only two criminal proceedings .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders committed every year with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely put on trial .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , even though they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ able , and although the terrain is now more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we all mi@@ str@@ ust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times hit him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot;
the cap drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and ex@@ tradition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of orn@@ ate two @-@ stor@@ eyed m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , has broken that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first of all there was the publication of an interview with Damascus Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival anti@@ trust frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons in February .
this publication may anno@@ y the sons , presum@@ ed aisle members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for its own security following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the problem of intoxic@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for the cour@@ a@@ geous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters loved to publish highly accurate investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was founded , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her reporting in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his Cour@@ age in the Per@@ sec@@ ution of Mexican Drug History , wherever it led .
he willingly offered that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task that you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead men ? why did you not tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team miss Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could cur@@ b like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is his love for the routine his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how they can best do their job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happens to J@@ avier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a , just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the space in which the employees of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones were allowed . days before it became known that sp@@ y@@ ware that is sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle class neighborhood of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the governor himself designated as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the repor@@ ters have gone to the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has fu@@ cked up three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known box@@ ers Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é on state expenditure , which concentrated on the home town of the Gover@@ nor .
and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a souvenir sheet from the office of the prosec@@ utor .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was offered when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century .
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were charged for high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez &apos;s column were considered to be the best informed source of ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slim body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was turned into a storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez grab@@ bed a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his .
journalists have become lou@@ der throughout the country by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walk@@ ways and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez left in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez bl@@ amed the authorities to spy on journalists and let them kill them because they told the truth .
she has since been asked to be re @-@ classified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ different society .
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and civil servants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to hold your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones are located next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to include the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publi@@ ci@@ zed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their country states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as apparently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City was murdered three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking is frigh@@ tened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight last Friday , when the last edition was finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when all their phones began to bu@@ zz .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with riv@@ els and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan bathing resort had left 19 dead dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a number of em@@ bas@@ sies in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge they released the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens how@@ l nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a glance at the police officers who kept guard to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid , they didn &apos;t show it .
under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day , on which J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to ev@@ ade its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening one .
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even find that his fl@@ ak@@ y skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said it had been something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es are the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk on 21 March 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that seemed to be out of place by the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years exploring the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy pe@@ ers .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you could almost believe it has slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , was probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used an shiel@@ ding technique , which is known as a counter@@ part , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed it to be better to mix in its surroundings and to ev@@ ade its enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ s@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the amazing maintenance of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
they discovered the sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the sh@@ ady is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals .
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r was driven out of sufficient pressure by eating meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the sh@@ ading - think of roe deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which indicates that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs must have been the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on clu@@ es about his life , including its preserved intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the sea floor .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread far inland as they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early C@@ ret@@ an era . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only look a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous time was a time when huge thermal di@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six ton heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk on 21 March 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the best preserved din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that hung from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were washed by Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the sub@@ marine equipment of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin residues still cover up b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as winning the lot@@ tery .
the more I look at it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales on his sole &apos; .
in th@@ under storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on the A8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , kilometers @-@ long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on the late Thursday afternoon .
according to the police , around 5 p.m. between the junction points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , crashed into each other .
in the first place , the exact number of injured parties did not provide any information .
a police spokes@@ man said it was about light to moderate injuries .
a large array of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A8 was completely blocked towards Munich .
in the direction of travel in Munich a ten @-@ kilometer @-@ long back@@ stage was formed .
as an A@@ Z repor@@ ter reports , it also came on the counter @-@ road to massive obstruc@@ tions - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade listed the vehicle &apos;s license plates , which now have to be reck@@ oned with with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : you don &apos;t sit in the train and sleep .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : buff@@ alo .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes a smoothly or pul@@ ls the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the independent ticket inspection .
you simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and make your ticket vali@@ dated .
at the moment , a test operation is running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer comes , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available on many other long @-@ haul routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train the ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use it , however , some requirements need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway .
you also have to buy it through the App of the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works in this way : one climb@@ s into the train , calls his ticket to &quot; My Tickets . &quot;
a button for the electronic de@@ valuation is then published with the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat y y .
if the train atten@@ dant arrives at the ticket inspection in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already de@@ valu@@ ated online ticket .
one can therefore continue to sleep , continue to keep quiet .
the check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn is intended to use the passengers .
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ti@@ ck@@ eting through our train crew , simply check out the DB Navigator itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s Marketing Management Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed features , ticket checks are among the biggest off@@ ences .
for often you have , in any case , not all the documents you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to show .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , resulting in poor sen@@ timent in the compartment or large area and delays in controlling your own ticket and the conductor will take the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .
and that also only on ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what are the streams ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to its core .
only one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment they rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post from a high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it &apos;s still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , as nobody else posted the information on her feed , she joined Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ ou@@ ted on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretching out on the road and staying there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought .
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she put off her mobile phone to return to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive later in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people crying , and a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said that another polic@@ eman called his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l reminded her of her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt shi@@ vers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and weeping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she picked up her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cin@@ emas from the age of 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that consists of the perspective of people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had inn@@ um@@ erable times before this morning &quot; over the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take them away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be re@@ ared therein .
it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even if I have the luck to give her an experience where she personally does not experience a bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep it away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place in front of the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism totally changed after August 9 , &quot; she said , and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Review of Nur@@ ses Association , concentr@@ ating on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r just wanted to document what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to mind Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by inn@@ um@@ erable cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ ct occup@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his commitment brought the project near@@ er to Fer@@ rel@@ l , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone talking to us or talking to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are presented , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that the Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells life , as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and the de@@ human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ferr@@ ell &apos;s story also repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 co@@ ined the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must carry the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement really is kept by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it insi@@ sts , however , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook up this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not a coinci@@ dence , although it was at the forefront because life at these cross@@ ings as a black gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the ra@@ cial links between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels committed to this memory since she walked into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV reader discuss bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people , even though it hasn &apos;t been built for a long time yet .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone spl@@ its the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the topic hardly leaves one cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one to the bit gallery says : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers into the city , of which also the rest of the shops benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then ble@@ ed out .
in addition , the gallery is being planned exactly on the property , where the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
with the beginning of the construction work will be concluded .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - to the Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with the possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; we have been shopping in the farmers market for many years almost a week .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women again and again very gladly .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to hope that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery will depend on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but probably the new project might not be very low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what makes shopping bags in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , drug stores or supermarkets : I think this is superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are already enough of them in our city .
you can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive .
as you can see , stores in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies because the hi@@ des there are often not portable to a retail@@ er .
it &apos;s a pity , there are no special shops anymore and what &apos;s left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market hall look like during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does the spec@@ tr@@ al bit gallery already make it possible to distribute all the shops in Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and nobody needs a shopping center that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to try to promote a farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmers market hall , thanks to the unbeliev@@ ably many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no longer a place .
once the market hall is damaged , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen tu@@ bs and hair@@ clips sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence agent f@@ aded a 35 @-@ year prison term after publicly classified as secret diplom@@ ats about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose sentence was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA that was extracted from Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , such as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look like a sharp , though somewhat intellectual commentary not just about the forms of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born in Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing clearly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in it the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ t and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look .
that was the time she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not be photograph@@ ed at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so you got in contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned mur@@ derer have become un@@ equal to eff@@ er@@ ves@@ cent who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they even created a com@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President of Chel@@ ny would transform judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published to request Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome type of happy meeting .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and heavy , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about all these things after the strange timing , she said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing with her super@@ large signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name ) demanded an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , the basis of which gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a replacement of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the involvement of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia of the artist ) , how aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully take with them is that our gen@@ ome will not care who we are and how openly genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above com@@ ic novel .
she shows Mann@@ ing , as she shows with a free telephone in hand from the discipl@@ in@@ arian bar@@ racks of the United States such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they talk about your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , which join together like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also aimed at how everything was in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that also stuck behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder
a nationwide human ch@@ ase is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who were considered susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday they were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au as the acts of the Cook County Court .
the documents say Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several years .
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Department says that the body was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the site of the event , and det@@ ec@@ tives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 , La@@ a has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at the Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ garbage , vice @-@ president of university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them had now been assessed and excluded from entering the campus of the Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ garbage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker from the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he insist@@ ed on the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them ampli@@ fy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that ladies and war@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian Vice President Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in co @-@ operation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s road@@ map to comply with the code describing the criteria for re @-@ establishing the R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and has recently been published on the Organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to alleged state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has admitted an error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ ations agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales point r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v admitted problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 as part of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for now
this divided the company groups .
it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could not be further assumed by any health impair@@ ment , it was said in the announcement .
from now on only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been demonstr@@ ably tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ine anti @-@ li@@ ce .
Al@@ di wanted to produce clarity and transparency with its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your staff at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the poll@@ s didn &apos;t work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
it has called people from the outside to help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at the growth in order to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employees &quot; commitment , it enables companies to conduct surveys , offer specialist groups and demographic groups , to offer employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite executives and directly contact the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit to track your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the snap surveys and surveys from specific teams , it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so that you can drill , why .
companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next bank who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken are punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial web site Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behaviour and to recognize , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent companies can send tailor @-@ made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and if the main executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the public opinion condem@@ ns the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that treats its employees poor@@ ly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and processes and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a intim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints of employees .
now that the company employs Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair intern@@ ships can be identified and addressed more quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to seriously take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen retired due to ethical bre@@ aches by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer their software as a service , and charge the company with recurring charges for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ it@@ tering secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bet@@ s .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their voices , and that the work that you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this business successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach yields when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and commitment of the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
in fact , when a company asks staff after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the changes are not fast enough , or not at all , this can raise dis@@ appointments and demo@@ tiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you will have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies who have reli@@ ed on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow , staff will ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday the company always receives new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better attachment of employees in an industry that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not committed to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it goes at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players conver@@ se on one side of the team &apos;s new exercise fields .
some have pulled off their jer@@ sey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these in@@ active minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three hour practice before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. in order to meet the already fully packed timet@@ ables of the players .
the compromise gone from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as conducted six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to do 18 exercises during the course of August . 20 before the beginning of the formal preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supported the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the most busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on it three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it through , they chat on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices once the camp is finished , which is not an easy task in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been raised with foot@@ balls that cleared a protective grid behind a door@@ post .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then hire themselves to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
so I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy fact @-@ review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and then display their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false reports and send them to fac@@ tual audi@@ tors , which may indicate results of the invoice audit from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they do not succeed in removing hat@@ eful posts like before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook spoke in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts test was launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides knowing which stories are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to test his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a Com@@ ic novel : a Castle in the History of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Ver@@ l River valley in K@@ ent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cos@@ mop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says pati@@ ently . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book by Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; in 2014 , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emo@@ tionally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just re@@ acted to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself was there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , exploring the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape care , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive that he described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristoc@@ rats said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , cast it on the attic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards representing what possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to pl@@ unge into English history on a broader base , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; that follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the Far@@ mers uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising started in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the ch@@ ateau - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patron who hid the family Dar@@ rel@@ l for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is presented from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite anno@@ yed , always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men solved their debt crisis by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise hei@@ gh@@ tened . &quot;
after the end of his engagement in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences
he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which since then has been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to finish with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the un@@ v@@ eiling of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honne@@ f started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday .
by Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .
at the end of August , the highlight of the campaign will be a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too nice for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their yesterday released website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in essence , we are firmly convinced that we as bad Honne@@ f citizens know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she is competing with other local communities .
the city of Bad Honne@@ f allows for a medium five @-@ digit amount to cost its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on retirement and carriage of officers .
so this week too .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the general staff , as in former times , but at the pres@@ idency of the Prime Minister .
under the head of the government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs also participated in the discussions .
as a result , civilians in the Y@@ AS were in excess .
the government pul@@ ls the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air force forces and the nav@@ y were dismissed .
since the coup d &quot; é@@ tat , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 out of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the ex@@ iled pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as a wi@@ re@@ head of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 persons who allegedly participated in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara since that week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had designated the coup attempt as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have a grip on the army ?
at the end of February , the newspaper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article titled &quot; Un@@ ease in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the General Staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the slogan for female soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the major em@@ power@@ ment of the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan had decre@@ ed further 7@@ 3@@ 95 officers , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly the masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
after his victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan th@@ ron@@ ged the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to the reform directives of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is actively driving forward an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; an especially not @-@ so @-@ called officer , seeking asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the coup attempt , would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if that happens , such a development could not leave Nato cold .
in any case , there is doubt in the Alliance after the pur@@ ges doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational abilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; NATO diplom@@ ats say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he pre@@ fers to lower legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by changing the way the US will be spent in the way of citizens from other countries of green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate circuit for the shuttle bus
over the past few months , the future of the racing game has been cont@@ ested - now it is going to be quite fast .
even before the end of the year , the road on which the tourist railway is going to be built will be built .
in order to ensure the long @-@ term future of the event , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will start on the track this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ i@@ tise the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is committed to this particularly important link , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Deputy Secretary of State Klaus Pun@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the track were estimated at approximately 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country exceeds 75 percent .
the contract on which the Shuttle will be ordered from the country on the basis of which the Shuttle will be ordered for the future will be fin@@ alised and expi@@ red at the moment .
the ministry and the southern Thur@@ in@@ gia railway as operator are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the timet@@ able , the vehicles used and the quality standards were negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expi@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the Shuttle will be ordered regularly on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g , especially for tourists .
in the course of a pilot operation in the past few months , it has been tested whether the route is being used by a large number of people to order them again in future .
the route is also very steep in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just as you thought that it can &apos;t be even cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ( foundation for responsible robo@@ tics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robo@@ tics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascension seriously .
customers can select the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are funny about them , but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex pupp@@ ets have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust his robot according to his convic@@ tions , and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but there will be more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progres@@ sively .
modern sex pupp@@ ets have evolved to robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold robots developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed person@@ ages such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adv@@ entu@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as best as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has its mo@@ ods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation , or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive feminine features , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one takes a step in Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah worries a most .
on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy compared to a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it means on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their formation and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something dark and deeper in our culture , on a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subj@@ ection as an optional en@@ core .
most men naturally do not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notices its increasing popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what tran@@ spir@@ es from the marginal zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not wei@@ rd or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time in which women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who bo@@ asted to have attacked women sexually .
the most horri@@ ble aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The maid &apos;s Report &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the st@@ och@@ astic eyes , but how realistic this vision seems .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( al@@ beit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , when it comes to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can &apos;t separate yourself from your companion or simply go away .
they have no intermedi@@ ary or a background story , nothing that suggests independence or anything , which could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : maid service
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human understanding
it has become a constitu@@ ent certainty of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that have pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we all work hard to let our filter bli@@ sters burst .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring together families .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republi@@ cans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , anyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship with which they had fought for decades for politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same page .
around the dining table it is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in another context that this also brings significant risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the des@@ pic@@ able effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the sp@@ ook@@ y possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will not exp@@ el us any more .
however , there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Republi@@ cans are &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; of the right wing , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ ab@@ len@@ ess in comparison to his standards .
today I think of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s qu@@ ir@@ ky version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur to one as very mild offen@@ ders .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only needs to be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the New York park &apos;s car@@ ou@@ sels , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need a caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are bul@@ ky and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ishing music conve@@ ys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings are old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city won &apos;t do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not across the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Top@@ ic Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ el is still a strange magic experience , as two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have rated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store was dis@@ ap@@ pointing , while I we@@ ari@@ ed the experience to reach my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was taken to hospital for the treatment of cuts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first funeral judgement .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing her through a door of the toilet cab in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a on her .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a ni@@ gh@@ tly intru@@ der who hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison term of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ eal , from which they say it is too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Authority said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal may be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ cul@@ tur@@ ists from F@@ ats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and the secondary schools .
three of the students go to secondary school in future , four at the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol of school release , the 29 students of the four classes chose Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eagle that grows in the chicken yard , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the m@@ lower band introduced a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Adler im hen@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and let it hat@@ ch from his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chi@@ ckens , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of it sm@@ ashed , and the eagle spread out its wings on a high mountain .
after that the classes showed three and four in the studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken tan@@ z .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ ck@@ les who wore cylinders to bet .
the eagle stands for integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te .
the young animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished each four @-@ owner that he feels accepted in his new school .
it was followed by a letter of thanks to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who has always accompanied the school and the parents .
the ch@@ ick time is over now , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher explained .
they leave their students only very reluc@@ tant after two years of instruction , because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ door hat@@ ers .
at the end , all students made a song of summer time and holiday season .
at the same time , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ pay@@ ers have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on TV , was quoted .
on the morning of 1 August a group of illeg@@ ally living people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
they were released the same day , while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camp and place any who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls will be continued throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people have to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do Diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of some 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emission behaviour of cars in the emissions scale Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of the ACE Car Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the software updates handled are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Federal Office ( KBA ) ordered their retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
manufacturers have announced quick implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler has announced to write to each person concerned .
if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done in their framework .
how long should the conver@@ sions take place ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this hangs from the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , voluntarily the autom@@ akers are not acting on the subject of the environment up to now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do drivers who don &apos;t drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group ?
the ACE suggests waiting .
presumably foreign manufacturers would like to reti@@ re , so S@@ met@@ anin .
does a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars now thre@@ aten ?
the ACE fears that .
but even in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
up to now there is no loss of value for older Diesel in the rural area .
the ACE suggests to wait for sale .
drill Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Award Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards received by the renowned Kennedy Center .
like the cultural institution on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the hon@@ our@@ able .
prizes will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and join together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the winner of the Le@@ ar prize , which has been published with progressive TV series , has already announced that he would not be able to attend the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the talk with Tr@@ ump to make her view clear .
the Kennedy Center named after former President John F. Kennedy is the biggest cultural institution in the US capital .
the former award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the town worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year .
the job is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been City Engineer for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press talk .
he reports on varied but also challenging tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it amaz@@ es him that so far no application has been filled with the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
this should be enough time for famili@@ ar@@ isation with regard to the regular periods of notice .
since Has@@ lach acts as a sub@@ contracting authority for the Administr@@ ative Community , the applicant must present relevant agreements .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it would not be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to travel to Off@@ enburg .
but the proximity to the citizen is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and a good mood among the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in the office , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back on the h@@ ack@@ ers with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the town worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident about the construction department and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park@@ land approximately have been initiated .
the bridge between Boll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed and the stadium renovation is still subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will take some 1.5 million euros in beech , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is great le@@ e@@ way for a city builder .
with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own building yard and garden nur@@ sery it is possible to react flexibly to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the landsc@@ aping of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have an eye for what fits &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring city building master emphasizes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any case , the Stadt@@ bau@@ master has a high level of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a client , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything is going on my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on long @-@ term employees : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years .
W@@ acker wants his successor to stay for a long time : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere , but also for the further design of the city .
if Roland W@@ acker wants to be buried , after inform@@ ing the town of Has@@ lach , he should have completed a completed degree as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ elor with subject field architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the fields of construction and construction planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt are in construction , civil engineering , construction management , property development , administration of urban properties , urban depot with a building yard and urban gar@@ dener , as well as under construction law authority , including monument protection .
bike thrown on lines : rail track locked
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle away from the railway track crossing in the area of Le@@ oben Street ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out from two male perpetr@@ ators and have been searching for them since the night hours .
close to the scene of the scene , a ros@@ y sco@@ oter and a bike driver were observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a coup d &quot; é@@ tat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators could have brought themselves into great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the facility as well as the delay of delay and the costs of rail freight transport , the pat@@ rons of the railway customers could also get to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum goes out , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be run without disabilities .
almost ten passenger trains dropped out on Friday mor@@ nings , two of them concerned the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall out , but they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( Infl@@ ammat@@ ory Bow@@ el Disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting around 1.3 million in the U.S. and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes ul@@ c@@ ers and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody diarr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the University of Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the senior researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it may result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments , it has been established that a type of tolerance promotes immune cells in mice that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a species of bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han would promote toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el lying , if the same system also works with people .
the post @-@ doctoral student Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe who was separately accommod@@ ated , had not had this .
she assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced in DNA sequ@@ encing and there were found six species of bacteria present in mice with immune cells , but lacking them in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they got the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i grew in a liquid and then led small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the mice food , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that humans have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells such as mice , and that most of us cross L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by@@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inside surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can potentially lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last high season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed the owner &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira have mar@@ ched at will .
however , matic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
alongside M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insist@@ ed that the club already made a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to fulfil three of his four priority commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; getting three of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have a great deal of trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US airplane manufacturer Boeing painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in the US state of Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing @-@ Logo was painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind is turning : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , S &amp; D prime ministers always looked after Berlin with a certain concern .
only no camp@@ fire from the party headquarters , but no counter @-@ wind from the federal government - was the most important wish of the election warri@@ ors .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the staff from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus with increasing horror has observed the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with counter @-@ wind .
there were failures .
one after the other .
the Federal CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green cannot be reliably ruled , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber from the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprise faction of a Gre@@ ens party led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the Parliament elections , his red @-@ green coalition thereby lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green German CEO Michael Kell@@ ner called on the back@@ sliding low @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets to return their mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ ke T@@ ests must immediately return their mandate , &quot; said the Federal President and El@@ ection Camp@@ aig@@ n of the Green Party of the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD leader si@@ ghs when the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message reaches the party headquarters on Friday mor@@ nings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , Federal Chancellor of the SPD , headed by Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without their own government majority after the transition of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ jackets .
it is the preliminary high point of a whole series of big and small crises in the SPD national associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the misery began with the unexpected clear defeat of the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the comrades cal@@ med at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this became even worse then - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the sw@@ amp , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te ble@@ w the party smoothly .
comrades in the weeks then strug@@ gl@@ ed with difficulty .
then , when they had just exhausted new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came .
and with him the next draft came .
mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD country head , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because he did everything wrong in the crisis communications afterwards , which one can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
so now Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW Ex@@ hau@@ st Ex@@ hau@@ st and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for some time now .
certain survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps because of this , Wei@@ l tried harder in the past weeks to set accents in the Con@@ federation .
the desire of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him alone , as they promised to stabili@@ se the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not responsible for the party @-@ internal purpose of the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz is not at all .
at times the comrades make every effort to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the stub@@ born parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ ests puts her own career on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ westen has not been elected by her person as a direct candidate , but on the country list of the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens in parliament , so the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on de@@ pu@@ ties continue .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters before four years were clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the German @-@ Sax@@ on SPD as the leading candidate in the election of the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clarify the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there will be further commitments from the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for local core III
those who want to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of the city &apos;s urban development informed Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 , there are areas of refur@@ bish@@ ment in the areas of refur@@ bish@@ ment .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy remained at least 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success @-@ project &quot; - it is finally important to promote inner development , and not only to open up new building areas .
on 4 April , the Karlsruhe Pres@@ idency received the information that there will be a re@@ development area III .
the total assets amounted to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 Euros were donated by the country , the rest of the congregation &apos;s feelings .
how does a san@@ itation area arise ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; so Sch@@ in@@ dler continues to investigate where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is also a role as to whether interest exists in the planned area .
if necessary , the area boundaries could then shift again .
the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programme in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the programme is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , the improvement of living and working conditions and the preservation and expansion of the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is per plot , carried out .
the renovation area would then finally be defined as a statute .
the eligi@@ bility period for the funding has been on effect from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the inventory takes place once again , in the context of which the participants in the rehabilitation area receive a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , the pro@@ posi@@ tional order should be carried out in order to begin with the renov@@ ations next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that each commun@@ e had to carry out the predicted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preliminary examinations &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about evaluating and deciding the urban areas of the town and to decide when it is being renovated and to what extent .
there will also be a re@@ mark in the land register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sens@@ ations and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphasized that a key success factor for the project is the participation of those involved .
therefore , questionn@@ aires will be sent which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and land rain@@ bow &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where , among other things , it is about the structural condition and the remedi@@ ation intentions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data on size , distribution and residents of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business arch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
furthermore , new building measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler also emphasized that the distribution of subsidies according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; function - who comes first , first grin@@ ds .
you can &apos;t reserve funding for later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have been shown in order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to come into house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory An@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the palaces of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now built @-@ in both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is on the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the White House decision to fly a nav@@ y helicopter to South La@@ wn for an event that highlights the American production in the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military &apos;s specifications that were left to TI@@ ME Magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior civil servant of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter manufactured in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was on display next to a ma@@ ine boat , a Wisconsin fire truck and a forklift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a question@@ able order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the nav@@ y helicopter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the deputy nav@@ al commander for aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 p.m. on July 17th and so long until the law@@ ns were cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft .
from the recordings provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the provision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sounds as if you were locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an imp@@ etus for reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon from politically beneficial purposes .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump took up an investigation in February when the presidential jet paid off against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports compl@@ aining about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy press secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often carry out training flights around Washington and South La@@ wn to susp@@ end the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
as a tr@@ ump at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House introduced 58 exercise land@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted on the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took over the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved to exhibit the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget labels for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however amounts to 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estim@@ ating the reimbur@@ sement rates is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include the personnel costs , but consider the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former press officer of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course , it is appropriate to highlight this . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man &apos;s car .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
runner @-@ up of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga cat@@ ches to the stand@@ ings in the stand@@ ings third Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow from 11@@ am in Kiel at the stand@@ ings third Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V .
despite five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the second Tennis Bundes@@ liga cat@@ ers to the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay , in any case , has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially in the back positions I find the crew very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the S@@ V Su@@ chs@@ dorf , imports from the high north are particularly concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strongly in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas B@@ jer@@ ry ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is becoming difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man is still active in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man at the time of the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec will be his first bet this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ vo@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was on the ball yesterday with the white @-@ rus@@ se An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski still at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el .
he should also be involved in Kiel but also like Bo@@ tic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again move into the team .
if it is enough for the 18 year old Hungary , who was still the number one of the junior world rank@@ ings in January 2016 , someone from the coaching staff around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay fills the cad@@ re .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump did not really feel happy when he put his signature under the law to tigh@@ ten the sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress packed a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the U.S. thrust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft plans to punish European companies that help Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of the O@@ MV ( O@@ MV ) , who co @-@ financed with other European companies , have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline ( Nord Stream 2 ) .
the threat is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estimation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions by executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is at the center of the hit series by Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars killer un@@ veiled , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not over yet .
the seasons three and four have already been confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest vil@@ la@@ ins of the show .
with the third relay the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organization of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i cart@@ el .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; with more governmental pun@@ ches and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is their head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican link , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ ers ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is in New York .
in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian prosec@@ uting authorities to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ vest@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .

roll back : the city has 46 kitchen aids
the city organizes the K@@ ita @-@ lunch @-@ table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the city &apos;s day@@ care centers .
on 1 September Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the city &apos;s day care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again in their own homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is kept out of house : a cat@@ erer takes care of this task and supplies freshly cooked ch@@ illed goods .
the city operates in the Kre@@ feld area 46 day@@ care centers , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the past kit@@ esur@@ fing year 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 weekly hours are eating in the K@@ ita for lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour support if children remain until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time staff will have kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the supplied food , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , divide the meal individually , give the food out , rinse , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two group@@ ed and sev@@ ent@@ een units - decides about the range of hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen assistants are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital administration to implement ped@@ ago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason too , it is about healthy eating and cooking classes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm that it has shown on the cost comparison between the own shelf and foreign assignment for the city as the most economical one , it is from the Press Office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong at about 750 people in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , Head of the Mission of the United Nations , said that hundreds of women will be candidates for the Council elections in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Tali@@ ban issued threats against a choice trial , which coinci@@ de with the transition from international combat negotiations to an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time will hand over the power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
Hay@@ som said that a strong role for women will rein@@ force the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

men trying to eradic@@ ate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 are supposed to have tried to ro@@ b a 13 year old girl on Thursday .
according to the police , the men spoke to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s cell phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and went on with her friends .
then one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to grasp the cell phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , which was mis@@ erable .
the duo fled without prey .
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
in the case of managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie , a union wants to make sure of the long @-@ term commitment to production at their factory in Glasgow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said that the company has remained silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which , in addition to other products , produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and union representatives were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the branch manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insist@@ ed on &quot; expressing concerns that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Senior Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply affected by our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workforce concentr@@ ates strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , rising living costs and chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react directly to it as we value continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly review our business - and that applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production . if our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of La League may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not refra@@ in from pursuing N@@ ey@@ mar after giving an offer of £ 189 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the World Record raid ?
the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season .
upon completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athletes in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about how N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans insist@@ ence insist@@ ed that the club always tried his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President in front of this prospect ?
when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with them , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circum@@ stance , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
that means Author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ es , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication in relation to the German press agency , he received an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg @-@ Bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would greatly serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their own false assessment of the proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand critic@@ ised that reporting on violence in the dom@@ es@@ tics would be measured with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the attacks in Regensburg no one doubt that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that must be punished and avoided in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; is striking , as the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis , too , said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we would like to go to the church and this is a found fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strikes have been a normal ped@@ ago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cope with bold children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they find it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for past decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the mis@@ use cases , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high pl@@ um @-@ sensitivity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 dom@@ es@@ ies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it is clear that in many cases Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister was employed in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
especially with high emotion@@ ality the punishment for the students could also be more intense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike many other def@@ end@@ ants , many victims estimate that many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even bring positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of violence practices in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , many students highlight his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as a ch@@ oline and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which has been pal@@ p@@ able by the bree@@ der when a dom@@ es@@ et didn &apos;t bring top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you do the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is generally found in it .
he has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ existence in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school also took place outside its sphere of influence .
at best , one can reproach him , to know of it too late , or to have taken first hints not seriously enough .
the gymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all the respon@@ dents as &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
the broad majority of his students , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , have a very excellent testimony , describing him as &quot; warm , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; know@@ led@@ geable &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as a very good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which sometimes led to her@@ edi@@ tary break@@ downs .
that he didn &apos;t just pop up with chairs and cast the key ring on the floor , but also pulled t@@ ear@@ ms and too nau@@ ghty boys on the hair or ears , he even admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question of time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents like teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced it in a world@@ ly school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of violence at the pre @-@ school , these are true Bag@@ at@@ elles .
one wonders whether it is not more with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just rus@@ hed on him .
many who have never understood him are still eager to work on the Bavarian Pope .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in connection with the report , there was a great deal of abuse on the topic of mis@@ use among the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger mentioned in the final report any involvement or acquain@@ tance with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not a single of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claim to have entrusted himself to the master of the cathedral .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one concerned representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with clari@@ fication of sexual abuse was and is that most of the victims are silent .
if they did not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader who would have been a colleague of the wrong@@ do@@ ers professionally .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students evaluate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see any case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that it is imp@@ uted to him ... to have opened in an im@@ penet@@ r@@ able or clearer or even more , than to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust@@ worthy teachers , etc .
that you talk to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report concludes with the clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the students affected and / or their environment in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to speak of any kind of acquain@@ tance .
so he cannot be accused of not preventing him or being brought to the display .
therefore , there is no reason to associate a good name with these disgu@@ sting crimes , as unfortunately occurred in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was much to read about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent eating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ visions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that in the coverage everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses and somewhere , right in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is exactly what a mis@@ use of the report is .
it is clearly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and ex@@ ams of violence as well as , we say , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents of the period since 1945 , i.e. also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
all the horri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were regularly las@@ ered and mal@@ treated , and suffered terri@@ bly , were all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions must have reigned .
but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys face when they were already on the gymn@@ asi@@ um .
on that , as most of the witnesses pointed out , the theme of &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; tab@@ oo .
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ di@@ ous &quot; conditions .
what was different from the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was a discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims rated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even have positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at most it remains the reproach to have looked away .
however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the operations at a school where he was not working and responsible ( such as the witness ) did not want to hear , and then only back in 1993 .
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger spar@@ ed the ears from the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the school gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the test sentence continues to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as testing pen@@ alties in Bavaria had long been banned .
before that they occurred in a legal grey area , as each of us is still aware of .
it was hard for him to estimate where those affected were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he &apos;s always looked away .
this is simply not true .
it was only in 1980 that the testing of schools in Bavaria was officially aboli@@ shed .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis affir@@ med that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ ago@@ gical standards at that time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; fall @-@ stri@@ ck of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is , the danger of evaluating the past after today &apos;s moral standards .
the princess was right there .
but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was abom@@ in@@ able , and also not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence to innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the then usual .
this is all horri@@ ble and I am glad that it will finally be worked out .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipline and punishment , such as ear fi@@ gs and hair and ears , were widespread in the 197@@ 0@@ ies .
when physical punishment was banned , he kept strictly adher@@ ing to it .
which image of his Regensburg time has shown Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother the Pope &quot; ?
did the subject of testing also come to terms with language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , from his perspective , as the dom@@ es@@ ies only played a minor role .
nevertheless , I do not mean by any means that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of un@@ conditioned discipline , it would probably hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , who went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , you don &apos;t even have a big voc@@ alist and stand before every success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people did you experience for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks to her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , deep @-@ hear@@ ted , deeply believing and hear@@ ty people , of which one can not imagine that he could only do something wrong .
I regularly get in touch with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ zation , keep in touch with him , visit him , read him - he &apos;s almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family .
those who did not forgive him until today , that he once was stern to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of the cathedral @-@ spar@@ rows are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respect for respect to which they still look up and worship them .
and please , once more clearly : all that you submit to it are educational methods that were then the order of the day .
we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is only too obvious the evil intent behind it .
for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him .
now there would be a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its and without those outside Bavaria and perhaps no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
