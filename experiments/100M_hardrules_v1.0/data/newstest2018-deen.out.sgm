<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren institution, where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "small gardeners cultivate the former cause of farmers." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich fosters exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It gets annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows that, because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a strapping road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but precisely so very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a Flickenteppich, which one recognizes as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">For cities and municipalities detailed maps, so-called exposure sheets, have been incorporated into the large map.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and were made up of the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader has occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops finally removed the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, it was the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph pushed forward the project, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and therewith the Bavarian surveying administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The source for Munich originates from the year 1856 and is found like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "the comparison of the former / today is the most impressive in the example of the state capital." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "the" "" "Sendling" "" "was built 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877, as a Munich suburb." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings were concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in appears a smaller-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered headings from the so-called "original recording" from which the land tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots yield no more farmers today, but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, the location of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of the present district of Au-Haidhausen it is not only the street name" "" "at the Gasteig" "" "or" "" "On the ventilation" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, one once blocked people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich District Irrenaissance" "" "On the Auer Lüften" "" "was created." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden was head of the institution - that psychiatrist who is brought in connection with King Ludwig II's death.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and for example finished the betting of so-called" "" "Irish." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also prohibited the personnel from applying violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenaeus in Haar 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-East is one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the premises of the former Auer Anstalt, youths now meet at the Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football pitch of the TSV München East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "children house - in architectural reference to the original construction of the Irrenaissance, was destroyed during World War II in bomb attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Main Square" "", "the Kaufinger lane was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944, the Allies bombed a lot of holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn trunk will take place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Fishers has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri because of the discriminatory policy and racial attacks of the State.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is to come into force by 28 August 2017, urges afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racial incidents occur in the whole state and are recorded here," says the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent law passed by Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination, as well as the state prosecuting authorities, who are disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to publish the travel warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights, people happen." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped or killed because of their skin colour, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization of a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more petrol during the trip and was put into custody by the police of Missouri without accusing any crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's office in which it is shown that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more frequent than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be ready to bring their money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crime report program of the FBI, which classify the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the United States had passed immigration laws, committing local prosecuting authorities to arrest people for immigration offences, which will contribute to further race profiling in view of the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently, interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elemental</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have given themselves a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the grave yard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischbacher CDU stand met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann granted first insight into his farm, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young kittens looked after and accommodated in five apartments holiday palaces.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest milk" "" "is the alternative marketing way for him for the milk of his cows, thus Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">Regionales only come to the table of the holiday guests.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also BLHV chairman of Fischbach, he described the electric fence project as" "" "essential" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "I cannot profit on such steep surfaces." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for a lot of work, a lot of things need to be worked on with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental business and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not conduct a bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader-promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the land could be delayed for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to continue their operations," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of conservation amounts to 40 hectares, which may not be afforested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the leader was promoted, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers had 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometres of wheat fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and rural women it's not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiß asserted:" "" "the best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Area (LPR) Baden-Württemberg makes it possible for the government to promote soft fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a circulating background specified by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the enclosed area must not be tractor-free (slope inclination over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened with reforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Weidezaunay project in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 pitches, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="96">The conservation area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump enters the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump Regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated quarrel with Jim Acosta from CNN on the President's proposals to drastically restricting legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he picked up their meaning, and in particular the importance that was attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "when Miller Acosta complained," "" "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about contemporary resonance to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, / your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely, / the eleventh apostasy of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "eleventh apostasy" "" "on our screens was better to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not commit himself in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they performed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show links between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a commonly used classical depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a disastrous attack on American nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, people wanted to change this from the right wing for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone, but rather an early neo-conservatives that bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty goes on.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch will not enlighten the way into the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">However, Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, afflicted, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this, of course, is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch will not light the path, but ignite the hatred which is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is rather modest." ""</seg>

<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships in the 400 m hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scotsmen are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner Muir leads along this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season that included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their fellow countrymen do not only belong to the team, but in some cases they will also join the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about this team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammate voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes, who want to climb on podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">As far as my speech is concerned as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you can't tolerate the heat-up of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long before the newspapers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He knocked on the criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783 Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep for slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore accused him of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with" "" "Na, and?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary hot head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and rigorous adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to bust his hair-less head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of individuals who come to the Governor's side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hosgans Speaker Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who are swinging the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and non-profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not crowded, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other current news," "" "she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I also do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject, and they are regarded by some rather as a so-called collective employment and are not recognized as a large group of citizens affected." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the Governor's staff designated as a" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical disguises or to arrest or silenced demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">"" "" "" "President Trump is accused of Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed." ""</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County has injured First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banished a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable port had a similar effect on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters kicked off his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, commerce and shipping with Britain, overcame his ministry, according to historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="425">Now Musk is dreaming of: 63.000 reorders have already been withdrawn from the 518,000 pre-orders.</seg>

<seg id="430">Its argument: the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not on demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla supplied 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models will be combined - 500,000 will be one million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1,800 reservations are made per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Whoever orders a Model 3 today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive his brand new production lines never tested in practice without major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>

<seg id="440">One day after he had been sued by 15 states Scott Pruitt, the head of the environmental protection authority, took back his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce the emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is a deadline for States to meet on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for ozone.</seg>

<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulations on the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the most recent legal setback for the Pruff regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>

<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress urge a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumour celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius-Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius system is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of tumours.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stressed: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergische textbook: "count Hermann von Sulz" sold the mountain to the parish church of Tumour, with the Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the Tumlinger mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a splendid courtyard, to which the church or the patronage was one and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the district Freudenstadt of 1858, it was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village picture of Tumlings, the "mountain" the third, the splendid settlement nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around 1600 are subject to these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval alleyway.</seg>
<seg id="477">A master who built a church and occupied it with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequeath this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two was broken on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed out later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were hammered and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796, French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the cemetery of Hilarius also served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing-silence.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year night in 1834 a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the existing tower of Turin still existed as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the Hilarius system as successor to Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">The organisers invite friends and supporters of Tumlingens on Sunday, 16 July to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">The preface is Hartmut Romann.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is available from 3: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">To conclude the serenade, a refreshment takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," "" "the organizers put out the fantastic view." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius system, which is of great importance for tumors and listeners.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and supporters of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to their home care, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini reaffirms.</seg>
<seg id="504">Association wants to let approval of wind turbines be checked</seg>
<seg id="505">"" "" "" "Boisheim" "" "does not see any legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the councilor." ""</seg>
<seg id="506">"" "the association" "" "Boisheim" "" "has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette." ""</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 there were no wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette, since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind force concentration zone at the border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time, the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">A few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided to change the land use plan a second wind power concentric zone in the Boisheim Nette - but that had not authorized the district government of Düsseldorf because of a formidable defect.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "due to the lack of planning law, the granted approval decision is still unlawful and therefore also to be accepted," "" "said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of" "" "Boisheim" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: before the summer break, the city council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; approval by the district government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "Erkens:" "" "with this, the granting of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is legally excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the entrance of the invitation.</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "the corresponding letter has been received by the circle of Viersen since last week," "" "said a spokesman." ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes them on the occasion to examine the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they probably do not cause the procedure to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">"" "with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the argument of the association" "" "Boisheim" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning to build four hundred metres high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65-hectare site.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - this corresponds to around one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-million households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Linnich near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="546">But also many locals would have lost the city centre when shopping.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end everyone would have to contribute to enliven the city center - up to landlords, the factories of the whole town and clubs.</seg>
<seg id="548">It was a matter of overcoming the lethargy with a network, which made themselves partly broadly, had said King in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="549">Birgit Streich, head of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Mühlhausen, announced that the third "home-shopping" day was the first time to take part in five Thuringian cities for the first time.</seg>

<seg id="664">The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar DENIC) shows optionally a street corner with wall rest and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elabar" logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="665">Before that, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer is parked in which the RheinBanners pose as a rock-ergirls, or alternatively a Isetta.</seg>
<seg id="666">Piled oil barrels remind of Castorfs Leitmotiv - money, power and greed - which is attracted by his "ring" staging.</seg>
<seg id="667">The three Rhine brains - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonise wonderfully as in "Rheingold."</seg>
<seg id="668">KESS seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), tore a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood-style and give the Krawallo-clique.</seg>
<seg id="669">Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen, which surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxers.</seg>
<seg id="670">Brutally the scene when Siegfried breaks down Siegfried.</seg>
<seg id="671">Later Gunther (Markus Oak) still has to believe in it.</seg>
<seg id="672">The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.</seg>
<seg id="673">Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated stormy, forming a humble and humble way to the Merkel-Raute.</seg>
<seg id="674">There is great applause for the Festspielorchester, which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothes.</seg>
<seg id="675">The performance was eagerly awaited by Frank Castorf and his team of directors.</seg>
<seg id="676">In 2013, when he had to leave a trot concert in 2013, there were five years later a great jubilation in which the isolated "Buh" reputations went down.</seg>

<seg id="681">Max quantity works as a volunteer</seg>
<seg id="682">They work in several places in their volunteer year.</seg>
<seg id="683">Where everywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: usually in the einfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked at school in the open full day.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with it?</seg>
<seg id="687">Quantity: it's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">They are now 26 years, so a late-called volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="690">How does it come?</seg>
<seg id="691">Lot: I did Abitur.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a degree of civil engineering, let's say, successfully broken off.</seg>
<seg id="693">I know for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something different to work with people.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked myself what are you doing.</seg>
<seg id="695">Do a social year, as there is an insight, you can see how it is on the spot, in the focal point maybe also, really.</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it like that?</seg>
<seg id="697">Amount: I collected great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">I will start my studies in the social system during the winter semester.</seg>
<seg id="699">I will study dual, probably make a social worker education in Jugendamt Herne and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.</seg>
<seg id="700">Is it not unusual to have several different places during the volunteer service?</seg>
<seg id="701">Quantity: yes, it is very variable.</seg>
<seg id="702">It always depends where you make your FSJ.</seg>
<seg id="703">It can be done from old people to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.</seg>
<seg id="704">With me it was very varied.</seg>
<seg id="705">I was also partially in the OGS, so in the afternoon supervision.</seg>
<seg id="706">For me it was exactly the right thing that irritated me.</seg>
<seg id="707">I could see my own strengths and see how it really works out.</seg>
<seg id="708">In a different way than in civil engineering?</seg>
<seg id="709">A lot: sure, here it's not about to calculate starches.</seg>
<seg id="710">One has again and again other people in front of each other, who have a completely different story behind them.</seg>
<seg id="711">Whether a refugee or a teenager has been taken out of the family - you must always respond to it individually.</seg>
<seg id="712">Very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="713">And you had no fear of touch?</seg>
<seg id="714">Amount: I'm not the guy for that.</seg>
<seg id="715">It is an area that gives a lot.</seg>
<seg id="716">Lots of love, lots of kindness.</seg>
<seg id="717">There are also negative moments, but life is so.</seg>

<seg id="719">The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividends by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure on which the company is facing.</seg>
<seg id="720">The job reduction, which CEO John Fallon mainly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019, comes in addition to its previous restructuring, where 4,000 positions have already been lost.</seg>
<seg id="721">Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) in May in a third cost-cutting program to revive a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning.</seg>

<seg id="726">According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died during the incident in the Qarabagh district.</seg>
<seg id="727">The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="728">On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="729">In a Nato statement it is said that the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint patrol was attacked with the Afghan army by a "improvised explosive device."</seg>
<seg id="730">The statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated at the Airfield Bagram in the US military hospital.</seg>
<seg id="731">Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="732">According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="733">At the end of July a suicide car event killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shiite district of Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="734">The Taliban said they had done this attack.</seg>
<seg id="735">On May 31, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the deadliest militant attack of the country since the US-led troops forced the Taliban from power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="736">Violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as U.S. President Donald Trump sums up the number of U.S. troops that support military and police in the country.</seg>

<seg id="743">A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.</seg>
<seg id="744">The government of President Donald Trump has tried to return a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda, which according to Trump should spur economic growth.</seg>

<seg id="748">In the end, the decision was clear: in the case of two opposing voices, the municipal council of Fluorn-Wind decides on the establishment of a community room in the future retirement home.</seg>
<seg id="749">Before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the missing piece of land is signed, mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports.</seg>

<seg id="752">One of the two investors, who are still in the boat, offered to meet the community.</seg>
<seg id="753">On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.</seg>
<seg id="754">The Administration and the majority of the Municipal Council pretend not to foresee such a common room as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the seniors-just residence, but openly into the congregation.</seg>

<seg id="906">"" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it runs great," "" "says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Traffic and Transport at the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the works began at the same time on all three refurbishment bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The building end is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be respected.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is an arch bridge made of concrete covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to guarantee stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges run across the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10,60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning has now received a 1.30 meter wide and seven ton heavy so-called bridge valve on Wednesday morning on the northern side.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a border fastener that is also used as a way of operation.</seg>
<seg id="919">On the southern part of the bridge a 2,20 meter wide bridge entrance is to be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian path is to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about this is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger Company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special fingertip-feeling has required the laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed about the project in advance of the works.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.</seg>
<seg id="927">For bridges between the building yard and the conglomeration towards Schramberg, traffic is regulated by traffic lights.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach town entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully closed.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football affect Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded expenditures of the European football clubs will not interfere with Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the guiding organisation controlling the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by UEFA mean that PSG must eventually prove that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can make money loose with security so that Neymar writes down and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Associations are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but must be subject to legitimate income sources allowing them to reach the break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had huge debts in their quest for success, effectively cheated and risked to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration on the debt of clubs to monitoring their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder business.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP distribution period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the Presidency in 2015, the UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to discourage herself from excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we are going to reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG pays the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the revenues for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was reduced to 20 million euros later - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a European company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring was to exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate revenues.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the sponsorship of the PSA was inflated by Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments made by the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">"" "" "" "but PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar's WM will be ambassador and that such maneuver could be easy to find out for the UEFA regulatory authorities." ""</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "the previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to ignore any attempt to bypass the rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars transfer, announced on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They discussed the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>

<seg id="1196">It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's Unterlippenbart of "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy feels like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It is the moments of accidental madness that could heat this franchise as a sort of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I think of as its logical conclusion: "wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the band how it will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon remembers another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-to-west ring combat iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy with Rhys Thomas created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are dubbed in English.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the Great Life: mezzanine and clever designer-tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrank in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne hasn't packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"" "" "" "before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," "" "Joanne said." ""</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something similar to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Storage and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light." ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to life for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function at the top or bottom." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to let it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all seating and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a little engineering art went in," "" "explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is very important, so that when you push the door, it glides very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious benefit.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>

<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a dispute because of one of the biggest real estate Imperial Victoria worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton-Football-Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp discussion of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers possess 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family purchased a business in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - von Paul described as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul, about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth EUR 176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The breakdown of real estate and cash has proved to be a major issue for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the reviews proposed by Colin have left him with what I considered for the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first case in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first court hearings of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle for control of the existing business - what Colin, like Paul claims, has excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul to incompetent manage some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the event, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both parties.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Wife De Lutis and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They took advantage of the security to buy the Collingwood Property in which Colin opened the first jeans of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive staff on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House that he wanted to fix: bad information that fell into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring his media device.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship to television is decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was angry because of unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were to convince," "" "said the former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February in front of Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keeping Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six ex-election officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trumps Twitter habit was ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials do not know what we others don't know - that Trumps tweets would have included even more combustibles without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his associates manage to keep away from him a few times, their efforts have paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump Controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, which are composed of competing parties, try again and again to present their own agenda by presenting Trump Material that possibly promotes their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisors to lead the president for strategic reasons doubtful information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press releases, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he tries to figure out where they came from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously accused a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur, Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">While Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for shkanes, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false allegations in the past and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "trump was reading the article and started asking staff about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paperwork and to document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tried three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself more effective as a priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente operating company mbH on April 13, 2014, approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and revenue from the local tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the autumn of 2014, in view of dramatically rising numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered to the district council as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the territory as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The former Hotel Birkenhof has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof with a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia affair: us Special Agent sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "in the past weeks, the panel recorded the work, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "on appeal to persons entrusted to the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcaster reported that there are already first invitations to the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to have purposefully intervened in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigations, several men are said to have acted as advisers of the republicans during the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also took a closer look at more and more trumps in a private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote several weeks ago that the special issuer Trump was personally involved in the center and to submit the accusation whether the President may have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">"" "" "" "the main task of Grand Jurys is to check present evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether they want to be charged." ""</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called anchor chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Usually they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor in order to invite persons to be carried out under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to CNN, invitations were issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who participated in the meeting were called to a statement, it was stated in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. were also Trumps advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his team Principal Paul Manafort at the interview.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the institution shows that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charging of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the president used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "the history of Russia is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the issue gives the Democrats an opportunity to" "" "feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But he usually works in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates all measures that accelerated the work of the special intermediary in" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it was not determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">There is no reason to assume that something has changed in this way, it was said in the declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">However, Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this draft, accusations against Trump have been loud, and have hindered the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey testified in June of a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up investigations against the then National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to U.S. media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent special agent of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later-trodden President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the insistence of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">But several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.</seg>

<seg id="1527">The broken colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C-Schelag.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelven floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">So it grows more and more into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelven is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the north of this slap, the balance of growth and abrupt was disturbed some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Schelude is broken down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelag is in danger, because the front edge has never pulled so far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can decay if a piece is broken down at a key place.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of ice cream and iceberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results in the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This may increase sea level, however, only to a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelude is the fourth biggest villain in Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the crossing from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the open ocean some 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural phenomenon and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sign comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the record began," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists, whether the Larsen-C Schelag is going to grow again or go back in the long run and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, "Our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not return the demolition of this giant iceberg to climate change, there have been very many ice-tufts of the Antarctic Peninsula in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The rise in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up around three degrees in the past 50 years and is thus counting on the areas in which the temperature is fastest growing.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU calls on the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, 41 new positions in the administration went through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The courses in the circle are obviously highly sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were recorded for the places to be distributed this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">However, the group still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently, there are still 50 vacant positions in the district of Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative in the circle day together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the lack of skilled labour in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "the management should work out a concept for recruitment and personnel development according to the wishes of the parties." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is to meet not only short-term requirements for skilled workers but to counteract the future-oriented evaluation of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, showing concrete measures for cross-members and involve an education campaign, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems you did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is by a real" "" "competition of public employers." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1575">Salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money exist only if you change to a higher level oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be established in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitution protection law.</seg>

<seg id="1579">Italy sharpens the tone on NGO migrants' lifeboats</seg>
<seg id="1580">Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they should not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations.</seg>
<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," "" "said interior minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa." ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German relief organisation 'Youth Retreeds' because their team had effectively worked with human hands in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express itself in the detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, the salvation of human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organisation in a statement on the social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only judge all allegations that are currently being collected after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'Youth Save', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is presumed that its crew takes dinghy migrants on board, which will be delivered to them directly by human hands, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of putting aside the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa, above all, have to have an Italian police officer who oversees their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, since they would not bring any" "" "essential changes or obstructions" "" "of their rescue operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign up, the Nobel prize winner organisation is doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">In the meantime, Minniti once said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations had declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the Minister." ""</seg>

<seg id="1602">The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim during hot summer temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="1603">Observation points followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were again and again long ascents, rewarding for the long trials.</seg>

<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sport has long become a serious business, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high commitments.</seg>
<seg id="1615">The first federal ligades have also recognised this, which are becoming increasingly involved in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.</seg>

<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is most likely to get used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobose has long dealt with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions, which are also found in classic sport - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, it requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in over 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">"" "the BMW Group said that the company believes that" "" "there are smarter options as driving limits" "", "and thus moved to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles." ""</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of car manufacturers to install systems for the neutralisation of exhaust gases produced by diesel vehicles also increase what makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with ignoring the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">Companies try to avoid the faults of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices which could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but driving back in normal driving conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1779">"" "his message:" "" "laugh," "" "for there is too much sorrow in the world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he, among other things, proposed himself as a draughtsman for greetings cards - which was frustrated by him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the release of his cartoons in Paris Match, and then in the "star" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">The artist was repeatedly inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, round Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, according to his own data, he still sits at the drawing table, works almost ten hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="1788">On calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and watches, his droll characters still find a lot of distribution worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">For six years he has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The protagonist in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos's favourite animal in his drawings - which has a thousand footer as an opponent.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining due to the conditions reminiscent of drought and because of the diseases transmitted by insects, leading scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert in the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years, which in spring has brought much less rain and in autumn a lot more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has an impact on the life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cikade, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather, there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">"" "Eric Chaisse" "" "instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened." ""</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>

<seg id="1810">The staff at the weekly Riodoce normally meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organising crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's salary list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from violence, and while the corpses accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has taken office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "justice," hangs on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts, who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Federal Attorney General was established in 2010, in order to process the cases of journalists, the Committee for the Protection of Journalists has opened up only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders committed every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely put on trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are inconsolable, and although the terrain is now more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know why, we all mistrust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15 Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times hit him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country since rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ornate two-storeyed mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "forget for a minute that there is a state of" "" "peace" "" "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce, has broken that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all there was the publication of an interview with Damascus Lopez, a leader of one of the rival antitrust fractions in the war with Guzmans sons in February.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may annoy the sons, presumed aisle members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the problem of intoxication," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish highly accurate investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award 'of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his Courage in the Persecution of Mexican Drug History, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He willingly offered that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team miss Valdez, the fun bird, who could curb like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>

<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Is his love for the routine his destruction?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>

<seg id="1867">"" "the anger is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happens to Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa, just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space in which the employees of Riodoce met for safety training, no mobile phones were allowed. days before it became known that spyware that is sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor himself designated as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has fucked up three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé on state expenditure, which concentrated on the home town of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a souvenir sheet from the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was offered when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI governors were charged for high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez's column were considered to be the best informed source of abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "" "" "in the past we knew what happened," "" "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "" "El Flaco" "" "because of its slim body stature." ""</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was turned into a storage space for signs and stickers that protest against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become louder throughout the country by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez left in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez blamed the authorities to spy on journalists and let them kill them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since been asked to be re-classified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and an indifferent society.</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to National Geographic reports, the herbivorous herbivores are the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, although covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used an shielding technique, which is known as a counterpart, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed it to be better to mix in its surroundings and to evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markschelli according to the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing maintenance of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shady is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaur was driven out of sufficient pressure by eating meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the shading - think of roe deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which indicates that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>

<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on clues about his life, including its preserved intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the sea floor.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous time was a time when huge thermal diodes, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six ton heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best preserved dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that hung from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were washed by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>

<seg id="1973">There are numerous injured, kilometers-long Staus - and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people were injured in a mass arambolage on the late Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the police, around 5 p.m. between the junction points Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm almost 30 vehicles, among them probably trucks, crashed into each other.</seg>
<seg id="1976">In the first place, the exact number of injured parties did not provide any information.</seg>
<seg id="1977">A police spokesman said it was about light to moderate injuries.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large array of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely blocked towards Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of travel in Munich a ten-kilometer-long backstage was formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">As an AZ reporter reports, it also came on the counter-road to massive obstructions - through numerous Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade listed the vehicle's license plates, which now have to be reckoned with with sensitive penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: you don't sit in the train and sleep.</seg>

<seg id="1998">"" "" "" "comfort Check-in" "" "calls the train the ticket devaluation without Schaffner." ""</seg>
<seg id="1999">To be able to use it, however, some requirements need to be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">You also have to buy it through the App of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The "comfort check-in" works in this way: one climbs into the train, calls his ticket to "My Tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">A button for the electronic devaluation is then published with the test customers.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat y y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the train attendant arrives at the ticket inspection in place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already devaluated online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">One can therefore continue to sleep, continue to keep quiet.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the railway - which in turn is intended to use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to travel relaxed without ticketing through our train crew, simply check out the DB Navigator itself.</seg>

<seg id="2012">Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed features, ticket checks are among the biggest offences.</seg>
<seg id="2013">For often you have, in any case, not all the documents you need for the devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passenger, resulting in poor sentiment in the compartment or large area and delays in controlling your own ticket and the conductor will take the time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.</seg>

<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the age of 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that consists of the perspective of people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had innumerable times before this morning "over the black experience and the black state."</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station, when she arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place in front of the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism totally changed after August 9," she said, and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Review of Nurses Association, concentrating on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>

<seg id="2058">Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came to mind Ferrell:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestract occupants.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV reader discuss bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people, even though it hasn't been built for a long time yet.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone splits the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly leaves one cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit gallery says: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "don't need a man" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents build on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, of which also the rest of the shops benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is being planned exactly on the property, where the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work will be concluded.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - to the Beda-Platz with the possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we have been shopping in the farmers market for many years almost a week.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women again and again very gladly.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to hope that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery will depend on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"" "but probably the new project might not be very low." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what makes shopping bags in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drug stores or supermarkets: I think this is superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, stores in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies because the hides there are often not portable to a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">It's a pity, there are no special shops anymore and what's left of it will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmers market hall look like during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the spectral bit gallery already make it possible to distribute all the shops in Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it just won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And nobody needs a shopping center that is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my opinion it would have been better to try to promote a farmer's market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmers market hall, thanks to the unbelievably many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no longer a place.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Once the market hall is damaged, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen tubs and hairclips sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence agent faded a 35-year prison term after publicly classified as secret diplomats about WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (a suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident, whose sentence was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA that was extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data could look like a sharp, though somewhat intellectual commentary not just about the forms of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born in Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning clearly sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butt and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be photographed at that time and she could not be photographed, so you got in contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned murderer have become unequal to effervescent who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"" "they even created a comic" "" "Suppressed Images" "" "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President of Chelny would transform judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally." ""</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published to request Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome type of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and heavy, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">"" "when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about all these things after the strange timing, she said" "" "things happen for a certain reason." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning with her superlarge signature (the "i" in her family name) demanded an end to the "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which gender, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a replacement of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the involvement of 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopaedia of the artist), how astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people will hopefully take with them is that our genome will not care who we are and how openly genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, too." ""</seg>

<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employees "commitment, it enables companies to conduct surveys, offer specialist groups and demographic groups, to offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to circumvent the C-Suite executives and directly contact the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to track your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap surveys and surveys from specific teams, it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so that you can drill, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture, so that you won't be the next bank who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who have spoken are punished.</seg>

<seg id="2224">If a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and processes and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company employs Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internships can be identified and addressed more quickly.</seg>

<seg id="2237">Glittering secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.</seg>

<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and commitment of the employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks staff after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the changes are not fast enough, or not at all, this can raise disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you will have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies who have relied on collecting data.</seg>

<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now performs monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported about Glint, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday the company always receives new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better attachment of employees in an industry that is known for high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was to be seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970's and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Verl River valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book by Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotionally.</seg>

<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, exploring the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>

<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" "" "whiskey and began to write." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>

<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to plunge into English history on a broader base, including 'The Labourer' that follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the Farmers uprising of 1381.</seg>

<seg id="2338">Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirement and carriage of officers.</seg>

<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as a wirehead of the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2357">The generals were formerly the masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they putted their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his victory in 2002, Erdogan thronged the power of the military step by step, not least on appeal to the reform directives of the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that it can't be even crazier in 2017, a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (foundation for responsible robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can select the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people are funny about them, but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more frequently," "" "said Mr. Sharkey at the release of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex puppets have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust his robot according to his convictions, and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But there will be more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford woman look progressively.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex puppets have evolved to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there are the Roxxxy Gold robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personages such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as best as possible," "" "enthuses the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has its moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, fixed on conversation, or she can" "" "be in mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive feminine features, the allusions to rape, when one takes a step in Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah worries a most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website, True Companion Roxxxy compared to a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" it means on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing sophistication point to something dark and deeper in our culture, on a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjection as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men naturally do not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notices its increasing popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what transpires from the marginal zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not weird or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time in which women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who boasted to have attacked women sexually.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The maid's Report ') is not the graphic images, the intricate body and the stochastic eyes, but how realistic this vision seems.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, when it comes to" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">You can't separate yourself from your companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no intermediary or a background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything, which could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the speech of 2017: maid service</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human understanding</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a constituent certainty of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all work hard to let our filter blisters burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, anyone who knows them, including the republican kinship with which they had fought for decades for politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table it is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in another context that this also brings significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the despicable effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the spooky possibility that one day his kittens will not expel us any more.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans are "normalized" of the right wing, which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to his standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I think of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's quirky version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump in fact occur to one as very mild offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republican only needs to be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York park's carousels, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are bulky and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-perishing music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings are old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city won't do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not across the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Topic Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park Karusel is still a strange magic experience, as two years old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to pay the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was disappointing, while I wearied the experience to reach my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain</seg>

<seg id="2452">Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first funeral judgement.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing her through a door of the toilet cab in his house in Pretoria on her.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nightly intruder who hid himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison term of Pistorius Appeal, from which they say it is too lenient.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, will retire next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The job is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been City Engineer for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun, as he mediates in the press talk.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports on varied but also challenging tasks waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it amazes him that so far no application has been filled with the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">This should be enough time for familiarisation with regard to the regular periods of notice.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach acts as a subcontracting authority for the Administrative Community, the applicant must present relevant agreements.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If it would not be able to fill it out, the citizens would have to travel to Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the proximity to the citizen is important to the city and itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate and a good mood among the authorities and citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2561">Wacker wants his successor to stay for a long time: "we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job."</seg>
<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">If Roland Wacker wants to be buried, after informing the town of Haslach, he should have completed a completed degree as a graduate engineer or a bachelor with subject field architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the fields of construction and construction planning law.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Stadtbauamt are in construction, civil engineering, construction management, property development, administration of urban properties, urban depot with a building yard and urban gardener, as well as under construction law authority, including monument protection.</seg>

<seg id="2576">Freight trains did not fall out, but they had delay.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study asserts exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the U.S. and 300,000 in the United States causes ulcers and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washingtoner found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells are patrolling in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it may result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it has been established that a type of tolerance promotes immune cells in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"" "Professor Colonna said:" "" "we have a connection between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance." ""</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan would promote tolerant, less inflammatory bowel lying, if the same system also works with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe who was separately accommodated, had not had this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">She assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced in DNA sequencing and there were found six species of bacteria present in mice with immune cells, but lacking them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they got the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then led small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice food, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells such as mice, and that most of us cross L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inside surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values can potentially lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>

<seg id="2718">The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was on display next to a maine boat, a Wisconsin fire truck and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a questionable order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the navy helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight.</seg>

<seg id="2864">The side of La League may regret its interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not refrain from pursuing Neymar after giving an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years before the World Record raid?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand, whereby Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season.</seg>

<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG President in front of this prospect?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen" report relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger "</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the misuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">That means Author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnes, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," declared after publication in relation to the German press agency, he received an apology from the former Regensburg-Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would greatly serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their own false assessment of the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican newspaper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "on the other hand criticised that reporting on violence in the domestics would be measured with" "" "double standards." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the attacks in Regensburg no one doubt that it is "shameful and shameful acts" that must be punished and avoided in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, as the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis, too, said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we would like to go to the church and this is a found fresco."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "strikes have been a normal pedagogical means" "", "" "" "to cope with bold children as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They find it unfair to apply today's standards for past decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the misuse cases, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the reminder" "" "My brother of the pope" "" "(translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber with the Enlightenment?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "with high plum-sensitivity" "" "victims of attacks, 67 domesies." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it is clear that in many cases Domkapellmeister was employed in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality the punishment for the students could also be more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, many victims estimate that many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even bring positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of violence practices in the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "on the one hand, many students highlight his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as a choline and perfectionist, which has been palpable by the breeder when a domeset didn't bring top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you do the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is generally found in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-existence in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school also took place outside its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best, one can reproach him, to know of it too late, or to have taken first hints not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The gymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all the respondents as "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">The broad majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, have a very excellent testimony, describing him as "warm," "sincere," "sincere," "knowledgeable" and "understanding," as a very good-natured teacher, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which sometimes led to hereditary breakdowns.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he didn't just pop up with chairs and cast the key ring on the floor, but also pulled tearms and too naughty boys on the hair or ears, he even admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question of time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents like teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced it in a worldly school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excretion of violence at the pre-school, these are true Bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not more with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him are still eager to work on the Bavarian Pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report, there was a great deal of abuse on the topic of misuse among the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger mentioned in the final report any involvement or acquaintance with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not a single of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claim to have entrusted himself to the master of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "said one concerned representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with clarification of sexual abuse was and is that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader who would have been a colleague of the wrongdoers professionally.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students evaluate Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see any case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd to assume that it is imputed to him... to have opened in an impenetrable or clearer or even more, than to their parents, dormitory leaders, trustworthy teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "the report concludes with the clear result:" "" "the students affected and / or their environment in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the study." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus free to speak of any kind of acquaintance.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of not preventing him or being brought to the display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to associate a good name with these disgusting crimes, as unfortunately occurred in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media there was much to read about" "" "violent eating" "" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "Divisions" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that in the coverage everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere, right in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is exactly what a misuse of the report is.</seg>
<seg id="2950">It is clearly separated: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and exams of violence as well as, we say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents of the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were regularly lasered and maltreated, and suffered terribly, were all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have reigned.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys face when they were already on the gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that, as most of the witnesses pointed out, the theme of "pre-school" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisidious" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was a discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this is also true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims rated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even have positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most it remains the reproach to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the operations at a school where he was not working and responsible (such as the witness) did not want to hear, and then only back in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Georg Ratzinger spared the ears from the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the school gymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out," "" "that in the pre-school the test sentence continues to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as testing penalties in Bavaria had long been banned.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us is still aware of.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was hard for him to estimate where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he's always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">It was only in 1980 that the testing of schools in Bavaria was officially abolished.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis affirmed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the "fall-strick of anachronism," that is, the danger of evaluating the past after today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable, and also not for what was broken in the pre-school of adversity and violence to innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the then usual.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all horrible and I am glad that it will finally be worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of discipline and punishment, such as ear figs and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970ies.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was banned, he kept strictly adhering to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which image of his Regensburg time has shown Georg Ratzinger in the talks with you for the book "My brother the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of testing also come to terms with language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, as the domesies only played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not mean by any means that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditioned discipline, it would probably hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, you don't even have a big vocalist and stand before every success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience for Georg Ratzinger during the talks to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, deep-hearted, deeply believing and hearty people, of which one can not imagine that he could only do something wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his emerization, keep in touch with him, visit him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him until today, that he once was stern to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cathedral-sparrows are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respect for respect to which they still look up and worship them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly: all that you submit to it are educational methods that were then the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is only too obvious the evil intent behind it.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which has just been published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now there would be a 93-year-old man who had acquired great merits and without those outside Bavaria and perhaps no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
