28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went uphill again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the judi@@ ci@@ ary department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was clas@@ sed as murder and the investigations underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS Tran@@ sm@@ itter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank first lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly man with a great heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his way to connect with his family was to cook us always something to prepare for dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that brigh@@ tly lit every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the S@@ F@@ PD &apos;s phone number under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put into drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this made the Hollywood star un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m getting stuck in drawers or glued on from the outside label that has little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are rather schn@@ u@@ ppe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
the act@@ ress loves to spend her time at home , in front of a television with a lo@@ cker@@ el de@@ bris and Mexican food , it is called in the magazine .
to white gl@@ ut , she raises the question of the desire for a child : &quot; we don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; says the Hollywood star .
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; is Ani@@ ston as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from the 25th of August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues was looking for a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CH@@ IO : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , the horses remembered their work , they hun@@ ted home to the for@@ age in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and so the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was the best gol@@ fer ever - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he let himself be led with his family over the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even bo@@ ther for photo @-@ purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
German sporting aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala , the Golden Sports Pyr@@ amid .
there is no lack of awards to the sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic ath@@ lete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver Lor@@ lau@@ rel leaf , Champions Tour Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored it .
a long one is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been supporting the offspring for decades .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was added to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the listed include the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the gymn@@ ast Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the c@@ aller Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ rider Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legend came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ ste@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza rate was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential applicants are not one in the tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental question .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are based on a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
der , about the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against the fact that the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wanted to control the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will push regulations massive , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the contrary , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has opportunities to open up discrimination and need money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why taxes for the rich would be increased , &quot; she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
in order to invest , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost verb@@ ally .
the democratic candidate has even announced the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical wing wing of the Republi@@ cans .
so there could be party internal discussions on Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more distinct .
Tr@@ ump aims to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ operate coal mining in the United States .
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , and he wants to cancel the Paris climate agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend the renewable energies with their investment program and demand : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - the two competitors are not too far apart from each other even for international trade agreements .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ fic trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
at the same time , both want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply to better protect American jobs .
they should then be paid better , including Clinton .
the present minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger @-@ wage .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump in this question wants to do is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to r@@ end up , then he says he may not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand is Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth .
his critics believe him that the budget deficit would be even bigger .
on the other hand Clinton stands , who wants at least from the rich , that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman experiences sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is almost a part of everyday life for women who flee alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each one has a baby that is at the most a year old .
one has put her little son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she s@@ miles briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene appears normal .
until you talk to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor of social aid services in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the North of Munich in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodations for all @-@ embra@@ ced women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs worked together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich women &apos;s help .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - either as a visitor .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experience with sexual violence on her run , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hope &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women , there are other reasons for the flight : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they do not see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run this goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ gs are demanding a sexual act , for example , for a bottle of water , is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
who believe that when they arrive in Germany , they are mistaken , told B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and at worst ab@@ used .
this leads to the fact that around 90 per cent of women living in the housing in the North of Munich are traumati@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience because shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , I need more accommodations just for them , called B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
to the question whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their sphere of competence , some answer no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in the housing of governments .
also in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fle@@ eing women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia there are several common shel@@ ters or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also demand that women must be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy is missing , or will men and women be accommod@@ ated together , it can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , available in the study .
how much women feel this need for protection can be read at the urge to go to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around us that we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily build a second house .
assistant physicians strike : demands for new labour campaign measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of the assistance specialists have called their union to appro@@ ve new employment campaigns in their disputes with regard to a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour campaign measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that ministers would have agreed to deal with the concerns of the contract .
in July , assistance specialists and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have remained silent , which led to the rejection of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board voted to completely reject the proposed new treaty and call for official re@@ negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today submitted a formal application to a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council in order to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating labour struggles that commen@@ ce at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the fact that in the past six times the resident doctors fought six times , the first total failure in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the B@@ MA assistant doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election to reject the agreed terms and conditions recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the sessions that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assistant doctors and medical students that the contract should be beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month @-@ long war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t resist the impression that Ankara wants to make this reconciliation most .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble and hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a paper describing that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something bad had never happened .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to be the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustained cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory remarks : the firing of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was stag@@ gering .
Putin condemned and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater , since it was committed by a supposed boy@@ friend .
to re@@ build the cous@@ in becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
the serious accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria &apos;s territories would have been controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place because Putin was ap@@ ologi@@ zing to President Erdo@@ gan who he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan is primarily required to get all the friends he can get after the last month at a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat of almost his office .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken it .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ seasonal attack on the Mediterranean .
this week , the State television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti put it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes are here long &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West as it regards its response to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continued res@@ ent@@ ment on the sn@@ ail tempo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ankara , the Russian state of state won a bonus that he called for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , a matter of course that has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this glorious palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; to me , as an analy@@ st once described me : two countries that are viol@@ ated and treated badly by the West and are now united .
nevertheless , in spite of the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents said at the press conference that they would not even have stri@@ pped the issue .
the President of Turkey deliberately avoided responding to a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphasize them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey dropped Russia &apos;s fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once more .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
according to the CEO of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand is to be further reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan announced the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this period , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer prices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , de@@ centralized headquarters and stock exchange to Nat@@ West will change .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for retail business that will get more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
during a sightseeing tour , Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed by customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he told the BBC Scotland : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we are pursuing no global goals , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship will no longer continue and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of brands , because how do we focus within ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori at@@ tains its 3.@@ 000@@ th prize at New@@ market on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ yed champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings 3,@@ 000@@ th prize to it
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3.@@ 000@@ th British gain on Friday at New@@ market .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , which is trained by John Gos@@ ch , on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey that reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the triple winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won from G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar before , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I &apos;ve landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori pi@@ cks up the che@@ ering when he brings victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ times winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached over 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career plans
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey players in the modern age , and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone , which only a few have reached before him .
it has style and is strong , but its tac@@ tical intell@@ ect differs from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a have been thri@@ lled by fans for years .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he already had 6,000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
in the UK , Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden the winners for almost 30 years , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
flying Fin@@ ishes Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori , has been the flagship of British flat racing for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of grand tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived an aircraft crash and was banned from drug prohibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago , he initially strug@@ gl@@ ed when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his two @-@ fl@@ orists and to return to his best form .
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to a minimum of 5 years .
Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin recently released Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov &apos;s Chief of Staff .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s narrow@@ est confidence circle for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed Special Repres@@ entative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin it is that Putin ordered the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as the chairman of the Russian presidential administration without giving reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been his deputy since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the Krem@@ lin website , it is ( in Russian ) that he later served as Chief of the Staff and Chief of Staff of the Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the main task of the government to support your activity as Head of State on legislative proposals and controls to implement your statements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysti@@ cal .
for a long time , Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest confi@@ dant Vladimir Put@@ ins and works like him for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ned on his own request .
but despite the ridi@@ cu@@ le for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
so is here the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was praised as potential president once upon a time would like to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great skep@@ ticism .
in his remarks on Putin cited on the Krem@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - wei@@ ghty items to be trusted for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , as Putin former member of the State Security Service , K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin reached power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted the most .
once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia since a third term of Putin viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close ally to Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he became the president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son participated last month in a physical examination of the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , announced his dis@@ mis@@ sal in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , officially ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the announcement of his dis@@ mis@@ sal on Thursday .
on the set it came to artistic differences and dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ sons from the series , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who had previously played in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Law and put my whole heart blood into the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a release published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the planned broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
puzzles for fish landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that there could be sand a@@ ale in the 75 fish that were picked up by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ ferry crossing : bridge now associated with Fi@@ fe
the € 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North Deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ a@@ duct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 slan@@ ted ropes .
the € 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy , Keith Brown , made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witness@@ ing an engineering of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit .
in total , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck is now in Ros@@ y@@ th a concrete foot for the deck , which means that the deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking high and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower , we had to close the existing gap in the north or the country side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
mas@@ sively as the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx . 3 % .
unc@@ le because the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ metres .
fortunately , everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after being thrown off fishing boat from ang@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI b@@ ail@@ out station struck the alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T , after a crew observed the event at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men strug@@ gl@@ ed to swim in safety while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and told us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of its reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have fortunately un@@ hurt and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone has watched over these men today .
seriously injured - man pi@@ cks up his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked and badly injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
as the police announced yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had given the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things .
instead , the alcoholic perpetr@@ ator dis@@ member@@ ed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured at the hand and at the body .
the police were able to arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
she then al@@ armed her sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down her brother .
but she could not move her to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
when the two women again entered the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old fed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors should be put much more into duty in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 affordable apartments over the next few years ?
at the next meeting , the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; housing concept . &quot;
but controversy is programmed .
first and foremost , it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments ?
so far , a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D leader Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : people who want to build on urban areas must reject 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments , however , can also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent in such areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , should provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants investors to make as few regulations as possible .
the left wants to impose tough@@ er conditions for investors .
no matter how viol@@ a , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market is taking place .
if the action plan is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which were to be built anyway .
but how can one compensate for the loss of more than 1300 affordable apartments , whose funding will run over the next few years ?
there will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone .
in order to prevent this , the planning oli@@ thic spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm should now be bought out of the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought of bringing apartments back to the price .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
because in the western city , fri@@ sts run at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the apartment building companies .
because the number of social housing in the west city is increased dramatically again , one is removed from the goal of so @-@ called mixing .
there should be no more concentration of socio @-@ weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although I have focused on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
that teenagers and children don &apos;t go out to play anymore , but rather prefer to spend their spare time star@@ ing on screens , was be@@ mo@@ aned by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially restricted to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones .
it is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s ( later , a carto@@ on series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) were created .
like many pop culture phenomena , interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand decreased slightly at the beginning of July .
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed due to the massive demand that over@@ bur@@ dened the servers .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that will be tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once they have been found , can be &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( by a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the boat and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that cover the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , recently informed the Washington Post with that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of follow @-@ up people who exercise every day 30 minutes , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get 30 minutes of time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; b@@ umped on de@@ af ears because many public messages are boring and coming from people that look el@@ ap@@ pointing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ valued .
anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical exercise helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoor that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always , there are also m@@ aces that have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what is it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough occurred .
even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit have already followed our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its charm and the use will decrease with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and will help many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the women &apos;s inventory
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on a whole line .
and now finally Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast cl@@ umped on Thursday to the championship title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ alists and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alli@@ st Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish bar during the solo campaign of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics event at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and overall the fifth while she rein@@ forces her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment ended .
this success puts it in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , 15 world champi@@ ons - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing practices that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she was expecting a final exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered a dis@@ appointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after having won gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ campaign in@@ ale of women at the Olympic Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clamation mark on the f@@ arewell party of Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i , who was going to reti@@ re at the f@@ arewell party .
even though Bil@@ es insist@@ ed , during her long journey to the top , never to have planned the future , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gymn@@ asi@@ um , trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as it wishes .
even if must@@ af@@ ina led slightly through two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive .
Swedish beams and ground clo@@ ths - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title title - lau@@ ded .
she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the Swedish bar - and sat on it with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her sof@@ tly as they expected her end @-@ birth - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision that she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ afa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old male capital , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her practice , she hur@@ ried to the audience kis@@ ses , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly expanding T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims killed in mass mur@@ der@@ ings when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ der@@ ous event of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police reported that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder would not have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ ory over@@ haul , as the aggres@@ sor did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the sho@@ ot@@ gun led investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven persons were killed in nine attacks in h@@ is@@ panic residential areas within four months and two more injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard of K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown n@@ ag from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the factory of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but like the least of his ages , Ed@@ mund has micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that .
I can &apos;t do that .
I didn &apos;t let myself in that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has settled on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your husband Vincent and you have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize them and that he may not even survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people are still doing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a subsi@@ dy .
Ed@@ mund was not able to sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of life and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund is interested in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- it says . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic factors such as Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the ci@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to ev@@ okes the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I always wonder@@ ed what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful suggestion for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives rise to ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday . it is expected all Saturday with more rainf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the south east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards said that civil servants have been in constant contact with the local authorities and were already on the road to help the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the governor , indicated that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags multiplied .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa alone requested ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather forecast showed that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could drop in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it continued to rain in the Mobile field .
the Com@@ ite River near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite River near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels after the weekend .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a flood @-@ downward flood in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams are still advancing people from floo@@ ding in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from its house , rises steep@@ ly overnight .
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and flo@@ cked in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told H@@ ans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years where she lived there .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all the obstruc@@ tions and he would be the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that emergency sur@@ ers would have saved all three in a large military truck and would have brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they were up to Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered ev@@ ac@@ uation directions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer log near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floor has been considerably su@@ cked by rainf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities gave out that heavy rainf@@ all and road swe@@ eping caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and In@@ tuition in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a subsidiary in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa threw 200 floo@@ ded homes .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated into two churches that were now floo@@ ded both .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , which were r@@ ins@@ ed by floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; once the water begins to go back , they will return to their homes , &quot; he said .
in Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen streets were closed due to floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents to take part , hoping to keep the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said it ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday had been reported as floo@@ ded , but on Friday no reported .
Keith Tow@@ n@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tow@@ n@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it is still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; en@@ ched by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police report that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered multiple shot injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in the hospital during his transport to the hospital .
&quot; he has gone through a lot , his small body was en@@ capsul@@ ated by spheres , &quot; said his grand@@ mother Del@@ ore Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter .
I can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter that he is likely to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical state , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it was apparently a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which have been trac@@ ed back to various storm @-@ guns , floo@@ ded the scene .
it seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were recept@@ acles .
it seems that there were several armed fighters who were very active here , &quot; det@@ ained by police det@@ ach@@ ers Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia .
several houses and vehicles were taken in the area .
there was no arrest , and the police are currently investigating the surveillance video .
on Tuesday , another six @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross collar on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West O@@ ak Lan@@ e .
it reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine in the women &apos;s Olympic stadium in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first , since 1984 I have been at every summer Olympics and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin colors .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jewish is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catholic is to round off , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an African @-@ American woman .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , how they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ tik@@ routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won gold in an individual multi @-@ fight event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t look at gy@@ ms in the whole country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie did all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to join the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four female players in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but reality looks like gymn@@ as@@ tics are a costly sport and gymn@@ asts come primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ tics that are maintained by parents who pay for training , orientation , travel appar@@ el , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ outs lie in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts will receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started with gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to give the churches au@@ n inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easily accessible gymn@@ asi@@ um .
I founded my turn foundation for 20 years .
at my events we have offered free and affordable hu@@ bs in Harlem for over 15,000 urban you@@ ths ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics to the youth , who earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develop strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , which brings thousands of young girls interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to take part in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this true depic@@ tion of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the hol@@ ocaust of the Olympic team and thanks for having motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way of becoming healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance specialists want to organise more strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance practitioners voted in favour of the election rejected him .
in July , Hun@@ t had un@@ veiled plans to introduce the treaty , and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful .
the first assistance specialists are to receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekly supplements in order to improve the maintenance of high @-@ end times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chairman of the B@@ MA Committee for Regi@@ stra@@ r , announced last night in a message with : &quot; assistance specialists have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and treat it to treat all physicians . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the B@@ MA to resolve disputes by talking clas@@ hed with the government on the reluc@@ tance and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the case of a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had done for the last month , that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise the condition and address the concerns of the assistance specialists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he did not do this , the assistance doctors made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work @-@ fights .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and physicians were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strike chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA wants a better week pay compensation for the 5@@ 4.000 assistant doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , urged the assistance practitioners to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labor Camp@@ aig@@ n Meas@@ ures reach nothing of the only little , but already charge over@@ bur@@ dened teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nur@@ ses and their families only worries , need and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past two months we have spoken to the Committee of Regi@@ stra@@ r and responded positively to the concerns of the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and the whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of cur@@ riculum , training holidays and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious they were employers , health education England and the Ministry of Health regarding adher@@ ence to the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine that can lower the risk of heart attack
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine after advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of stroke or further heart attack .
the N@@ HS Regul@@ atory Authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS Regul@@ atory Authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and one quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls .
when the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots break , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the initial draft of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness makes electoral fraud flour@@ ishing in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was removed last year due to the release of a government report for corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report today disclosed .
the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town coun@@ cils to have ignored proof of mis@@ use due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , now an anti @-@ corruption sc@@ andal , said that the intim@@ id@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to establish shut @-@ off tapes outside of electoral cabins to protect intim@@ id@@ ated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he suggests that voters should lead an identification with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , a vot@@ er merely needs to call his name and address .
the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink on a person &apos;s finger when they vote their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ andal in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor of Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was to be reli@@ eved on corrupt and illegal practices of his office after a lit@@ any .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis that it is the rel@@ ig@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation by which a person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he was particularly alar@@ ming in the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters - when older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including leading ID cards to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; evidence has been established that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or b@@ ang@@ la@@ ic background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... governmental institutions had ignor@@ antly ignor@@ ing such behaviour on the basis of &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sensi@@ tivities relating to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban that political activists edit letter voting documents to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suff@@ rage &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also calls for tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for immigration and social security purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID card .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for automatic postal voting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prohibition that political activists handle complete let@@ ter@@ backs and envel@@ opes from let@@ ter@@ heads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have the power to set up shut @-@ off for election stations .
a change of legislation that facilitates accus@@ ation of intim@@ id@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Assembly Act 1983 ) .
prohibition of photography in election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the staff generally en@@ force that voters go alone into the voting booth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal complaint was made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral district has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for illegal and illegal practices because of a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on account of a number of reasons - according to the high demands of the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the elec@@ tive registration departments of the Town Hall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court surfing in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the Mother of the Par@@ liam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy for K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous dou@@ bles of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are advised by the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T except the border and the band , which proved to be an impressive double @-@ player of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic champion is by far not the only athle@@ tic ath@@ lete , who has his own famous double @-@ gän@@ ger - at least not if you may believe the social media .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that currently fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympics that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team at bow shooting Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood .
apart from K@@ ate Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the rac@@ et@@ rack , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team at arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son caused a rush to Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I might consider it a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between British Wei@@ t@@ jumps Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa with her big expressive eyes is supposed to go through as a double @-@ player for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one course higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption act@@ ress
another ongoing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal winner Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va has more than just the sun @-@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian has been att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
put theory into space : according to this user , there might be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair
a Twitter user told her satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an unbeliev@@ ably similar facial form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ unen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympics exc@@ uses for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers have died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis on the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 100m Fre@@ estyle swimming sta@@ ffel so@@ oth@@ ed spectators of the C@@ BC live transmission of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical Games on Wednesday
Canadian broad@@ ca@@ ster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; like low @-@ off &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m outdoor swimming pool .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought to board the comment@@ ator team of C@@ BS to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , descending like a low , died like a pig .
thanks for that .
the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swim squ@@ ad 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed the Canadian to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were shocked by the sound and the language
Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Does the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just say that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; like a pig has died &quot; ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot hasn &apos;t broken that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m outdoor pool for women : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter arrived quickly and hard , with which many were talking to him
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how un@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; w@@ ow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us look like ra@@ cists . # ek@@ ed .
a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comment and said , &quot; We ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of more than 90 times with the people who responded to the No@@ tice on Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
C@@ BC copied and ap@@ ologi@@ zed to more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald .
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be radi@@ ated .
yesterday night we were quickly inde@@ b@@ ted to our audience on the show and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not to them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . B@@ yr@@ on is very sorry about what he said .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment that I made after the Women &apos;s Pool in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been referring to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was inten@@ tional and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the buyers didn &apos;t know where to look , when a woman drew up her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try under@@ pants .
to ag@@ grav@@ ate the situation , she looked as she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back into the shelf .
she continued to rum@@ mage and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone .

&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she picked up a pair of pants from the delivery , pulled off her own pants and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet spot to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone gaz@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants which you obviously did not like , as they put them back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three more under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , pulled off and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to bo@@ ther her that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who , under certain circumstances , would buy the pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take home spirits that had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I received , the employees tried to pull the clothes off the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of pants and find out that another woman had her and went out and did not wash them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Pri@@ mark spokes@@ man said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that happened on Tuesday August 9 at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming into question were pulled out of the sale .
how to protect yourself from weapons attacks using Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to flip the spe@@ ar for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you are approaching from behind , then you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the shot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with the knee in the l@@ ath and twist , while the aggres@@ sor kno@@ cks against pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while they set the weapon on him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the weapon and twist it so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot .
shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and strike the attack@@ er on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it pre@@ fers Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that with a rob@@ ber@@ y it is saf@@ est to hand over your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ outs for a travel guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and stran@@ gl@@ ehold of a serious test by le@@ aking some of Europe &apos;s dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k dropped his course on a euro note , a rail@@ ing on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a hing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before checking out each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is getting involved .
but the experiment , which was filmed in the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the idea to check the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a tow@@ ing toilet that has been used by thousands of others may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey across Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad taste in his mouth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el by travelling through the world and eating odd and wonderful things . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from public funds to train stations to washing up dum@@ pl@@ ings of toilets , the task posed its immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film , he did justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial version showed a lumin@@ ometer number of more than 4000 units .
in comparison to this , the lumin@@ omet@@ ry number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a r@@ ussi@@ an toilet that he refused to refuse after her lumin@@ omet@@ ri@@ al number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands show one of less than 60
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. W@@ right and Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst that I have o@@ iled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more mut@@ ate than that !
I will not lick here because it is in@@ doors here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company provides Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
Vali@@ o Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that is fascinating to look at while explaining the advantages of pro@@ bio@@ tics at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we caused crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming by saying that we told &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us to call Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film directing , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I had instructed him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick them up and others , in which this was rather difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of all surv@@ eyed lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally using products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ zi@@ al family left their social housing after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation with a loss of £ 50,000 because it had terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after having been forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls showed plain@@ tive holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared on the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for home administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons living in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted was street fights with bas@@ eball bats , intim@@ id@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ pping and cur@@ sing .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
old tr@@ ash was found in some rooms of the house , which may be demoli@@ shed under certain circumstances .
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were torn up
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ iled her and her partner this week by force from the property after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They weren &apos;t afraid for anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years alongside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we are saying the police here are incredible .
&quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
now that they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said it would have cut off the family with local authorities .
the family lived in the house , to which the police was called at regular intervals , for 20 years
tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the community house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family , as del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police , as well as members of the community cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have provided us with the information .
I hope this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress resi@@ ding in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing on the floor .
workers of the house management will now have to swe@@ ep away garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don was fin@@ ed after having found guilty of ow@@ ning a drug of class B in trade .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came to life in 2013 at a car accident .
after they were homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti coated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they are del@@ aying ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row of the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall communicated with the fact that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ reproach and those who have been har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal stag@@ ger@@ ed after a ti@@ lag@@ ging military jet flies to the beach
sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of air force forces put an incredible fall flight
the air force forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed that there was no safety risk ahead
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ er@@ ving jet is crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew close to the sun wor@@ ship@@ pers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers sprang up when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the nozzles without first seeing what came to them through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holi@@ day@@ makers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fell down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deeply
the Portuguese air@@ strikes today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that due to the bad visibility of the area around the area , the jet flew a bit deeper than usual , but the air forces insist@@ ed that safety at no time was at risk .
land fires have destroyed part of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where also four people on Madeira Island came to death .
the Portuguese air@@ strikes today announced that the pilot had to fly as deep as possible because of the conditions - heavy fog and smoke .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against the FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash climb@@ s three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ gew@@ inners must refra@@ in from shooting with the superior Cup@@ fin@@ alist and reig@@ ning Europa League champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
there is also a lack of Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
the German suffered a b@@ anding in the knee with the help of Claudio Bra@@ vo at least initially in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen were already competing for the status as number one in Barcelona for two years .
in this respect , Coach Luis En@@ rique reno@@ unc@@ ed a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the remaining cont@@ est@@ ants had taken the step .
before the first obligatory game of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness state of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
even at 3 : 2 in the pro@@ beg@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really know how to convince .
Sevilla , in turn , has continued to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims at the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with so far eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition .
Ma Long in a separate League for Table Tennis Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
the World R@@ ank@@ ers first won the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ Tournam@@ ent and Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would bring the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympia @-@ podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sentences and time @-@ outs they had no coaches with them .
they drew back to the grand@@ stand and left their prot@@ ectors on one another in fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches up here I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the finale I play for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang said as a result . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists were posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really strug@@ gl@@ ed with his 28 year old opponent only in the first set .
after that he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang on only a total of 13 points .
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , the unexpected ro@@ using match did not develop .
nevertheless , there was enough breathtaking ball change to be seen .
Mi@@ zut@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White rus@@ se had contracted a ri@@ b injury , after that he was in medical treatment , had to settle &quot; ultimately &quot; with sheet metal .
by the way , the Sweden Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) had become Olympic @-@ Vi@@ erte in similarly high table tennis .
Donald Tr@@ ump grants ″ massive problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Republi@@ cans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave some weaknesses of his campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire usually appears to be large and self @-@ confident such a thing as concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having cast 16 ri@@ vals within his own republi@@ can camp , the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ ical Christians whom he asked for support in important federal states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilty were false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media shu@@ ffle .
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds are shaking
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the re@@ public@@ ans .
according to a survey by surv@@ ey@@ US from June , Tr@@ ump and his rival from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were on the same .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview with CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it wasn &apos;t enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that &apos;s okay , Tr@@ ump continued .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party is said to have threatened Tr@@ ump to cancel funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better results .
instead of this , the candidates of the Republi@@ cans are stronger under the arms of the Congress .
Olympia : tri@@ ster fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to establish a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee immediately announced a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function told that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine specimen in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
this was reported to the team leadership K@@ eni@@ as by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Association has requested the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , a IA@@ AF spokesperson distributed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following actions of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and acted as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , handed over the sample and signed , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch has become a World Cup fourth in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation leader Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport .
since some time in Kenya , the IO@@ C has been under special observation after numerous times of dop@@ ing .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio games , it was previously pointed out that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted .
before the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had exer@@ ted a great deal of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya accepted the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the WA@@ DA rules .
Kenya is regarded as a major runner @-@ nation .
athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of television reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ting .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation into Kenya as he had done in Russian athle@@ tics .
it could be proven that this sport has been partially and systematically de@@ activated .
Russian athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Year the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the West Side Story , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth room .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she rec@@ alls with melanch@@ oly her love with Tony , while the younger Lady is playing and dancing .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so it is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; it resembles me very much , my Italian character I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with it .
it is an enormous human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all !
for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley &apos;s &quot; West Side Story &quot; is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we went to New York and the New York residents did not want them .
they are the same subjects , and today they are just as meaningful as back then .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer , Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e , said that a few weeks ago her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ werk of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died shortly after giving her family to leave the war @-@ packed country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good in it - as a reminder and warning to others , that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from the east of London got to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and she became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d said Clinton will stay as a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of a victory in gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , Leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the candidate of the Republi@@ can Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia &apos;s Supreme Court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulates .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not concern un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the supreme judge of the U.S. Court of App@@ eals for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republi@@ cans blocked the country &apos;s nom@@ ination , were Lak@@ ai@@ en and Hel@@ pers of Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
Tre@@ ats wants nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine co@@ operates with photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine of old@@ school play@@ boys is distingu@@ ish@@ able , since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do that for women .
apparently , he believes that it does the Calendar as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to go back to depicting timeless and classical nu@@ dity where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release to publish the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at the open Cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t suit and praise Erdo@@ gan , sit on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nah &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dialog and Welt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kurdish community of Germany short @-@ term forecasts with tens of thousands of asylum seek@@ ers who flee from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it might even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the hard work of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ d congregation of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at short notice I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of ob@@ seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already over@@ hau@@ led Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds with sanctions against months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing within Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the failed coup , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further repres@@ sed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refugees itself refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chief of the Association accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
that Erdo@@ gan would like to increase the pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of the Association demanded that the federal government be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is opposed to Erdo@@ gan &apos;s critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the fire mark as a Gü@@ len follow@@ er destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not adapt and praise Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the c@@ em@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near foundation Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the newspaper , calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks had already introduced the largest group of asylum @-@ approved asylum @-@ holders in Germany before the coup .
at the reporting date June 30 , this was 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all recognised as eligible for asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there are not those before war , poverty or lack of perspective .
asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; going to where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
in 2021 , the Parliament election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because stupid as so far it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ for @-@ day elections - that is bit@@ ing .
the locals , who want to be convinced by the election warri@@ ors , are on holiday .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers in the country , on the way to Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so do not choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : during the holidays hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and end up voices just lab@@ orious .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and the last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again pass an election campaign close to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , Leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
exciting is how strong new Af@@ D inter@@ sec@@ ts and what remains at the end of coalition dust .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous electoral campaign .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , Se@@ ering has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel has the blame on the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ st@@ ened the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is now probably going to cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if one makes election campaign in the right place at the wrong time .
she has invited chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to open classes twice ; Merkel &apos;s federal election circuit is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast @-@ CD@@ U largely disp@@ enses with the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means co@@ king , playing only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noted that , on the country , its base will crum@@ ble , that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you do it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any present in the expan@@ se of the country .
the Council of the CD@@ U vot@@ er Kok@@ ert to his fellow comb@@ ats is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; you must go where it hurt , namely where the people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much is on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD a particularly committed election campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats stood at 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the 2011 election , the SPD had already won with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Green Party , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , will probably make the leap into the land .
they make a modern virtue out of holidays @-@ need and transfer their campaign largely into the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he calls the chairman Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green election warri@@ ors embar@@ k on a search for local favour@@ ites among vac@@ ation@@ ists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the leading candidate , cur@@ v@@ ts straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and also finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at 8 p.m. , there are everywhere praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they made everything pretty sh@@ ack@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no default .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week until the end of October everything will be ready .
the award is also given to those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of right @-@ hand desc@@ ents .
since the construction site has mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and that the connection to Rot@@ tenburg will again exist , the traffic situation within the village has eased .
the citizens can now travel from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the traffic passes through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some serious complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deputy Head Office Florian King responsible for the management of the refur@@ bish@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ sals had to fight with more traffic noise because many sne@@ aking routes were looking for and more familiar to their nav@@ i than the signs .
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fra@@ ying .
as the speed limits were not met , the municipality also called for the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself informed himself on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have already been s@@ lit .
the quick@@ est was on the way with 77 ho@@ ur@@ ly kilometers in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 re@@ organization has led to revenue frac@@ tures with them , everyone one asks to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; thus produced for other companies , have hardly any consequences for him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; at the most slight decline &quot; in the car deal@@ er@@ ship Ma@@ ier , but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; the running search is missing . &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the restaurants along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Krone , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential threat .
not only him , but all inn@@ s made it &quot; hard . &quot;
customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we must be happy about each euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the revenue losses are based on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking began its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his employees have to be dismissed .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where something more generous has been handled .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 and refers to the long history .
it can be understood that other regular guests are now less frequently able to pass by because of the complicated traffic route .
if you cannot approach it , it is also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his family @-@ client@@ ele returns after the end of the rehabilitation work .
despite the crises with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 works on his client@@ ele for the greatest crisis that his restaurant experienced in their long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
it is permanently bol@@ ted to laws in the name of the fight against terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what has a divor@@ ce status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Rec@@ on@@ c@@ iler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his suggestions are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable to the coalition partner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the introduction of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t over@@ load anybody .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
even in this I am full of offen@@ se .
but as Minister of Interior he was on the basis of results and in a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , De Ma@@ izi@@ ère had a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but these are all the more extensive .
some have already known , proc@@ laim@@ ing that a new security authority is to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany must implement several EU targets on passenger data and arms law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second attempt for proposals that had not been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and dum@@ b jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still thinks this is reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything that is not a chance for the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas are presented by de Ma@@ izi@@ ère as well .
they have partially in themselves : he plans rapid proceedings for deport@@ ations and more ways of det@@ aining people before deport@@ ation .
refugees that are targeted at the country should let their smartphones be checked beforehand and social media accounts for a security check .
in case of divor@@ ces for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than so far - about those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them are politically and legally sensitive .
some are still un@@ filled and leaves questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does it actually do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people worried about safety in view of the high number of refugees .
and things that the people deeply occupied were not allowed to cling to election campaign times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inner security is hu@@ gely moved into focus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elections .
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in a position on the issue of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few days between the two parties involved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a gar@@ ris@@ tian discussion about the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security @-@ political ideas collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the heads of the department also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual nationality .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also lab@@ ori@@ zes here for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from a return from the double pass .
we have limited the discussion in Germany .
to re @-@ open it is not meaningful .
and he has constitutional concerns with a Bur@@ ka prohibition .
whether his own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , must first appear .
there is a lot in it , which could cause disputes .
but the SPD is also trying to profile itself on the issue of inner security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ y@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel first sign@@ alizes willingness to talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , Volkswagen will be able to perform gli@@ st@@ ingly .
despite diesel sc@@ andal , deliveries of ex@@ tradition are rising worldwide .
but it does not run smoothly in all markets .
in the recall action there is confusion about a term .
Volkswagen will start deliveries in the second half of the year .
despite the many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus in the previous year .
but in July , VW &apos;s core brand was weak@@ ening above all in Western Europe and thus weigh@@ ed the total sale again , as the company noted in the D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer cars than in the previous year &apos;s month with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
in Germany &apos;s home market , deliveries declined by almost one sixth .
brand sales chief Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann reduced the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been a reluc@@ tance to buy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British boy@@ cot@@ t also bur@@ dened the EU exit , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust gas world first escal@@ ated , a minus is also standing .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected household brand of the Lower Saxony is still frau@@ dul@@ ently due to the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only a delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
from January to July , Group sales chief Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales platform further .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
in the course of the conversion , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after retro@@ fitting the car , the car manufacturer issued a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate but does not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was stated on Friday in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now grants its German customers a guarantee for re@@ inde@@ struc@@ ted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed VW &apos;s representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
the Ministry of Transport confirms that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my In@@ quiry Commission and the KBA in full . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from these are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power will not take place after retro@@ fitting and all type approval @-@ relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was meant in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , with the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen has the possibility that for example , for example , customers will be able to come into a workshop half a year after the retro@@ fitting - and this could lead back to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also in the interest of the client , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , there may be uncertainty about possible warranty regulations as it was meant .
therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pen@@ al interest from rich savers in future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank Princip@@ al Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on checking or daily money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers would not have to fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay for their harsh pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks are spending money on night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay a penalty of 0.4 per cent .
this fee demands the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund back from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros to deposits or daily money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 will cost 400 Euro in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had bought 40 million euros for some time , which could be withdrawn from one day to another and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief of the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for each million Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter pays the costs further .
letting the cash flow into the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank &apos;s saf@@ es would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; said the Bank vice @-@ president .
most customers had understanding and altern@@ ated on other forms of investment .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ operatives of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to bear alone is not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their fees for bank account management , credit cards or bank transfers .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , chief executive of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay nationwide charges for deposits , so the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

destination She@@ ets : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely middle aged men love records .
before you ha@@ sten to the comment section to review it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ all@@ unity men of Middle @-@ age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much talked about re@@ formation of records does not lead to a boom in Mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who have recently bought a plate are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age of 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
there is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance : older record buyers still retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do you agree with the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog was a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wear a modest gray suit and let go wild before I stop , hold my hands and say something better like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I of Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three men of middle aged ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men of middle @-@ aged , one woman , probably around the 20 ) follow , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates .
these vinyl records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and bought new items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60 &apos;s , early 70 &apos;s who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things in which I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend some time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets on the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media pump , people who have heard about com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records .
from the conversations I have conducted , people usually have settled around 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers contacted the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , of objects that evo@@ ke happy ju@@ gen@@ der@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or property of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is as a collector so and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to get involved spiritually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee fl@@ utes from a record stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not own record players .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned as I fl@@ atten up through a stack of bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three men of middle age ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; someone only came here recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sil@@ encer so I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ consuming , less music @-@ class .
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have record players . &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who only come in slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted nearly a whole floor to the records , has a b@@ lower audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and women of middle age .
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts of the latest Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sexually @-@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz we@@ ars out of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks stran@@ gely lonely , but na@@ ï@@ ve psych@@ ic trauma is hard to imagine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
it rather makes a window @-@ bum@@ per rather than a big shopping .
she doesn &apos;t deserve much , therefore collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or in any other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she drives away with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I seem to have to mu@@ zzle the je@@ ans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter decide to buy a crossover record player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essenti@@ als plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group , who has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates .
even though my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are correct , they , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , have un@@ accounted for the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their th@@ urs@@ day morning with security not with bum@@ ble@@ bees through bur@@ sting shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets by plates while they ste@@ er clear to the star@@ ring gaze of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false pres@@ enter who raises nothing over the shoulders of middle @-@ aged men .

French Court re@@ jects quotation on demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to en@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , sell hair services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture argued that these places were to be demoli@@ shed because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that have a risk of fire and san@@ ity .
humanitarian groups told the Court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people operating the 72 provisional businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the t@@ ear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated non @-@ profit and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimates on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle of the jungle has risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number by now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer .
despite Olympic dis@@ appointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic Time race , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get lost .
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , stay confident and fight , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he has no explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place in the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hon@@ estly said to me to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyse in peace what reasons for the de@@ bac@@ le had led .
at the World Championship in Qatar in October , Martin actually wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll just look at everything we &apos;ve changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers must adapt to the next generation speed meas@@ ur@@ er : in different federal states , including Hessen and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are being tested , which should lead to a particularly effective over@@ haul .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used in accidents , where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itated bridges with temporary speed limit , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary speed camera for adher@@ ence to speed limit .
a permanent mobile setup can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery holds five days for un@@ interrupted measuring operations , the case data is transmitted enco@@ ded via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded across multiple lanes simultaneously .
variable speed limits as well as drive @-@ through restrictions after time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
the trailer is able to move with each car with trailer hit@@ ch in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state .
to ensure that it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also disappear into a cast @-@ resistant outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities are also flas@@ hing with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces after placing an order of 150 copies last year .
Britain brings silver in 7 @-@ year Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gets gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ year @-@ old Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the final hur@@ dle in the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were struck with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ odoro Stadium here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji issued a master class in handling , side @-@ stepping , back @-@ up , line running and raw power to gain gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
defeat was missed by the silver medal not too bad - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least one Br@@ ite will hang a gold medal tomorrow around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s head coach Ben Ry@@ an , the former head of England in Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , she lost every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and left G@@ b &apos;s attacks out of fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if one would run into running buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au gr@@ asp@@ ed in the corner .
with another four minutes playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he converted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB have hardly touched the ball .
a dr@@ astic T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third gate , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua left a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re@@ play and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u squee@@ zed through further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med to the line to make a goal .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still listening .
this is how it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua went through after a brilliant Inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton launched a test for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long in favor of the South Sea Sul@@ li@@ ans , whose fans sang , sw@@ inging flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged and GB ki@@ cked out crus@@ hing in the grass .
earlier on that day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain crow@@ ned South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ als from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a score among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ king by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by a fight with the coach &apos;s cancer for a rowing victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ inary gold than in these games and that wants to be called .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard drives that go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach , Robin Williams , was present at the second Olympic stadium in a row without a tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British Sports who laid such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ fired use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant athletes who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the style of the trium@@ ph@@ al arch .
behind each gold in the herd is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers , who make a difference to the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who did not know 30 months if he was diagnosed with cancer this day .
as he said , he ris@@ ked .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that they did .
if you do not do that , he expands everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which stopped the interruption to a minimum if that was the right term at all .
I needed money , so I had to go back better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning with something more than anything else to talk and thus tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , which was a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . it might be a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much this means , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning didn &apos;t lose any race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close , p@@ anning and glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very trapped in the moment .
Hel@@ en called , &quot; Ke@@ ep in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking to make something great .
today we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ works , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , what we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week at a wedding , their own with the TV adv@@ entur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
exemplary for clarity for 31 years
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , is reti@@ ring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water association as a model for large water producers .
this meant that some time ago , the original sound was made in a contribution by the Bavarian Radio .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia acknowledged the purpose @-@ association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was 31 years in the ken@@ nel team , stands for 28 years as managing director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , located in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , transports approximately 150@@ 000 cubic meters of water per year and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member communities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ heim , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Bürger@@ forem@@ an Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler was hired as a water@@ keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Con@@ federation in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water pipeline construction and maintenance work on office and organisational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chair@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event , she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new well ( 1994 ) , purchase of land in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the restoration of the elevated tanks ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the partial re@@ constructions of water pipes .
there has been no down@@ time and I have always added new things because water means life and drinking water is the most important food .
in their Lau@@ d@@ atio , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose band@@ age and he has lived the water @-@ purpose band@@ age as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for the nit@@ rate reduction in front of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken Water@@ forum .
for that he received a lot of praise and praise .
Ru@@ pert g@@ öl@@ ler , on his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water man and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his point of view he described the well @-@ being and the restructuring of the ken@@ nel .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , were the rup@@ ture of the tu@@ bular break@@ age at Kirch@@ lou@@ on on January 3 .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
one can only maintain the supply of new brun@@ n because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .
the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is open with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;

but the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago was well ahead and now learn privately in New York , where there are the best therapists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : when I ask him something that &apos;s two years back when I sang at La Scala , he remembered nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est person on earth .
Ti@@ ago originates from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s connection with the Bass@@ bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Schrot@@ t .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man sho@@ ots at risk of life
on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district of Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district of Stor@@ mar@@ n ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself called and indicated to have shot his life @-@ mate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , and after him I was publicly tra@@ cked .
meanwhile , Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 m tall , muscular , brown @-@ burnt and has a smooth .
meanwhile the police published a photo of him .
however , it is a couple of years old .
meanwhile the man we@@ ars a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon , such as the police .
those who see Sven S. will call the 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born 1988 , the cul@@ pri@@ t in 1981 .
in the first place , the competent police in Lü@@ beck did not want to provide any information about the death or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; but it confirmed that a person had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not saying more about this at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special assignment command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - flash@@ light for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions .
financial burdens that threatened the sector from green electricity subsidies are from the table .
it remains at the release of the renewable energy revolution in the existing plants for so @-@ called self @-@ power production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach that after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent applies .
but also these are not raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on self @-@ power generation .
as a result , the status quo of the current regulation is largely as@@ cer@@ tained .
Gabriel &apos;s successful endeav@@ or is of particular importance for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our &apos; steel &apos; campaign , it is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the reform of emissions trading , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the situation escal@@ ated further than the world &apos;s largest producer of producers in China threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers throw price dump@@ ing into Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation has eased somewhat .
on the one hand , imposed import duties on import steel impact , on the other hand , economic prospects in China have risen .
it is not clear how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least the prices had stagn@@ ated .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp also did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , the German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Business Union announced on Friday .
after a short up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the produced quantity went back to each other for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output .
community , spirit , health : singing elderly well
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied her entire life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher &apos;s study she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall living , she says .
by the way , they do something good for their health and spirit .
from several perspectives , singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German retirement league .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and cultivate social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has also made this experience in her choir : &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of toge@@ ther@@ ness . &quot;
singing can be stren@@ uous in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
because sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand his lungs are not as fast as possible in everyday life .
even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursul@@ a L@@ enz of the Federal Employment Service of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Organis@@ ations .
in the older generations the common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
through lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia @-@ sick people are sin@@ king into long @-@ lying events .
while singing , a special performance is required to the head , explains L@@ enz .
to concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone do so not only concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , writes H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ este@@ em grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise something for a long time , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
whoever wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz says .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears when a sound goes next to it ?
in search of the appropriate offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tance in a senior choir , one can simply join himself .
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn right to the church or the church leader .
many sen@@ iors can also be found via the Internet .
if you have no access to the Internet , you can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the internet search .
if you want to sing , you should join a choir , tell H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for every age .
cats react more sensitive than cats to cri@@ es of young animals
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover which effect the herd of cat babies has on adult animals .
to their surprise even the males did not let the males get cold - however , they always beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the degree of reg@@ ression of cat babies at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond to Lau@@ te von K@@ ätz@@ chen by ten percent faster than scientists from the veter@@ inary university and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) have found themselves in great distress .
males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - though always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young are either not perc@@ ei@@ vable or not important , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es differ with the ur@@ gency of their need for assistance .
a total of nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the livestock hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a rep@@ ut@@ ment of little ones who were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from the mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand they were confronted with cri@@ es of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised additionally .
the researchers maintain their results despite the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the cri@@ es , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned more quickly to the speaker when this calls of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises several times .
some studies showed that women responded sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , a major football game takes place in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul round the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
already in the im@@ position of the state of emergency after the attempted coup in July , the government regre@@ t@@ ted that the daily life of normal citizens should not be com@@ promised .
this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the Movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt .
even before football it is not stopped .
against the former strong Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r , the public prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant .
accordingly , the South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kis@@ r should be a follow@@ er of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , it actually has no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but in the face of dramatic experiences in the history of the Turks , the strict rejection of military put@@ ties is what unites the strong of the Turks .
even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at cup winner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially good for Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 fo@@ ols and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top scor@@ er of his club .
in the final match against Fen@@ er@@ bah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory bull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also retired early in the Europe League .
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g it was only sixth .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the game year ran better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 rounds of the season as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ scor@@ er king .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez who signed at the AC Florence under contract and released on Bes@@ ik@@ tas was announced after the coup attempt , not to return to the country after his EM holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to do so , the Stür@@ mer would have to be ready to ren@@ ounce approximately one @-@ third of his annual salary estimated to 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man made clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have med@@ als in Rio Olympics
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin had already been locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
others convic@@ ted athle@@ tics can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who compl@@ ained about the games after a dop@@ ing @-@ lock shortly before the games , was mer@@ cil@@ essly fl@@ acci@@ d and hat@@ ched at their start ( 100 m chest ) .
it was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : with a set smile she was still in the hall and had provoked her appearance .
when he found out that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a jubil@@ ee .
but there are numerous other sports@@ men who , despite the dop@@ ing past , go to the Olympics in Rio .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he had been locked two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and former world champion has been running even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the greatest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to ab@@ ort a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after it was proved by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don &apos;s pain .
after having suffered severe tooth@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended himself .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European Championship was positively tested on the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl h@@ exag@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the wis@@ p intake and was closed for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and closed for 21 months .
a means for penis enlargement would have been responsible , bet@@ tered Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer Th@@ row , Bel@@ or@@ ussi@@ a ) : hardly any ath@@ lete got so many med@@ als afterwards .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having identified testosterone dop@@ ing .
in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to hand over Olympic @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the European title 2006 due to testosterone ab@@ uses .
he also received the Bronze Med@@ al of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Sports Tribunal ( CA@@ S ) .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is in rank two of the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record scientist and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was only tested positive in May but can still start in Rio .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion has found evidence of taking a forbidden dietary supplement , the lock of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) fell mil@@ dly and ran off on 13 July .
bom@@ bing terror in Thailand - Austrian hurt - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered cuts and had been treated at the hospital , but I have already been able to leave it .
they planned their home trip for early September .
whether other Austrian citizens are affected by the further explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ber , it is still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in initially explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explosive charges went up again , and another person was killed according to the authorities .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
during the det@@ onation in the vicinity of the popular bathing beach of Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police information .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ eastern coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a municipal cler@@ k .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed before the Re@@ vier of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast demanded several injured .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same signature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee on Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it to be a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves to possible motives , but it is likely to be the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical for the bom@@ bing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage which is restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta have been laid .
the authorities would have kept secret advice on upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however , they had not been informed of the exact time and places .
it is not yet clear which group is hiding behind the attacks .
police instructed their officials throughout the country to rein@@ force security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment quarters .
in Thailand , there are again and again smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Thailand &apos;s king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the well @-@ known explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on his website to follow the instructions given by Thai security authorities .
high safety risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ v@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , no necessary trips to these provinces will be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution which was dra@@ fted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this ad@@ mits a great influence to the military in the years to come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; j@@ un@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the military un@@ ta , which took power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , resist@@ s itself to reg@@ ain stability and order .
however , it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hin@@ du @-@ shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several Off@@ ices , the Constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists have also set up the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see in the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; indications of aspir@@ ations against the free democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chairman of the Constitutional Court Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are being de@@ fam@@ ed in an extrem@@ ist manner .
that is why we are watching the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multic@@ ultur@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , H@@ esse , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; identity . &quot;
Ma@@ aß said that his authority was closely aligned with the local authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chairman of the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful voice , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the ties Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a real advertisement for your own cause .
propaganda is meant to appeal to people emo@@ tionally .
young people are in a special way vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there were reports on the contacts of the &quot; identity &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states .
Ma@@ aß said he had no knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - will change its direction and become so extrem@@ ist - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor here is whether such persons have an influence on the party .
this is not identi@@ fiable .
with a view to the significant increase in righ@@ tist crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ aß said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but in recent years we have found that there can be right @-@ wing terrorism .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
it may well be that further right @-@ wing groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
but a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of rights @-@ terrorism is not identi@@ fiable .
the previous groups were formed on the regional level or in social networks .
Ma@@ aß vo@@ iced concern that many ass@@ aults went to the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the susp@@ ects on asylum @-@ based attacks were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing at all with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different , or for example , have elected CD@@ U , SPD or left who , however , have radic@@ alized themselves through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist voices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always will the Olympic Games or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bold appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Rio de Janeiro Summer Games .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the easily obes@@ e s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia are so slow that at times he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently transferred to the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a back of 48 seconds ended up and took the 59@@ th place of 59 ki@@ cks .
but it was not just a sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special starting right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries well @-@ known .
since most sports@@ men are running in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of the wh@@ ale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; referring to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity @-@ belly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 @-@ metre @-@ free style , played no part .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ba &apos;s run provided media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the bu@@ oy@@ ancy chamber from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to stand alone in a passing over 100 metres of free style .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the im@@ pending election defeat so close
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing to do with the election of the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump already has an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately , it will either work or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ cans in a telephone interview with the US TV station CN@@ BC .
if it wasn &apos;t enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that &apos;s okay , Tr@@ ump said .
thus , he called the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist group Islamic State ( IS ) .
last but not least , resistance was formed within his party .
mail going to trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell your electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter as well .
in a nut@@ shell , the Group wants to launch trade with the transpor@@ ter .
the next year , the post will also offer its electric v@@ ans on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for months , the company has been examining whether it should sell its self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and packages are delivered , also to sell to other companies .
post @-@ Managing Director Jürgen Ger@@ des had said that there are always inquiries , for example by craftsmen .
according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bonn @-@ based company will shortly enter the mass production of vehicles .
in its own factory , the company plans to construct up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete transition to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long run .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we change the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on the roads of Germany since 2014 .
GF@@ RP leadership dis@@ ap@@ pointing after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research firm Gf@@ K de@@ votes his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the rel@@ ic@@ ts suddenly appeared - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K fores@@ had@@ owed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the corporate leadership , the world &apos;s number five is facing a new beginning .
GF@@ RP Chief Executive Officer wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
the management board of the Executive Board already handed over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ruck@@ inger as early as 1 September , divided the company .
he is to officially assume the function of a &quot; executive officer &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to name a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
who will be the market research company in the future , is still unclear at present .
in investor circles it was said on Friday , with the shareholders the dis@@ appointment about the continued success of the restructuring introduced years ago was great .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K summit since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of restructuring were not yet to be seen even after 5 years , &quot; he said .
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholder will eventually be rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this were the case with BMW , that would also do the qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the Company did not stop its loss of power in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the comparable figure for the previous year .
compared to the first half of the year , sales shr@@ ank by 3.4 percent to EUR 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million .
earnings in the second quarter above all imp@@ acted the company &apos;s s@@ unken investment in the face of its difficult economic situation .
the company advertising amor@@ tization of 139 million euros , which had become necessary in the Consumer Experience division , gave the Group a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K posted a net income of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus slides in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight injured
in an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police .
according to her instructions , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to diver@@ t her information on the opposite truck .
the bus desc@@ ended to the right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police officer Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances came to the accident scene on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ injured travelers were taken from a bus back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the load veter@@ ans and possible witnesses to report to the police .
as of 1 October 2016 , the fees per cubic metre of waste water will amount to 3,@@ 44 instead of 2,@@ 10 Euro for the waste water facility in Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ donated 3,@@ 44 ; for Al@@ low@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 euros ( up to 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( up to 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are needed .
after a rough calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf is then at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported it was noted in the approval of the household by the Kul@@ mb@@ ach District Council that for these sewage plants under@@ cover under@@ coverings .
due to legal foundations , the market Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the systems at a cost @-@ covering basis .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens and the industrial and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the wal@@ let .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Head of Management Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board , a new calculation of fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period between October 2016 and September 2020 , over@@ - and / or under@@ coverings from the previous calculation period should also be compensated .
Schmidt explained the serious charges of charges with the fact that all three sewage plants were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water waste , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
as a result of the low distribution base , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water level in all three plants is slightly dec@@ lining .
furthermore , in the rec@@ lining calculation period in all three plants , not least because of their age renovation and repair costs have fallen to a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p are almost 20 years old .
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the wastewater treatment plant in Az@@ endorf .
the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up at the Wel@@ sch@@ ahl pumping station and , after nearly 20 years of operation , the first sewage pond had to be repaired , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ es of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water regulations in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses came from the continued assistance and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that with the low waste water waste in the three plants , the expenses for the operation and maintenance were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully sm@@ ashed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs , has been spar@@ ed in the past 20 years .
the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious following the view of stone houses in the long run , particularly as the supply area of the Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal sewage treatment association could not be extended because it deals with defici@@ ent facilities .
Bulgaria posted inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % has been recorded .
the average annual inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 there was a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6,@@ 3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) .
the prices remained as in the pre @-@ month of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool , Snap@@ chat enables some 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders the absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ en@@ stein picture .
the filters are bl@@ unt , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million new sel@@ fies per day .
all wrong@@ doing leads to the public .
in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in which they were accused that the app would promote black face fo@@ e or white skin as beauty ideal .
when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them s@@ lit @-@ eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist carto@@ on by Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeated controversi@@ es showed a greater problem that the company has a diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have turned off the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was conceived as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as carto@@ on by Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism , the filter reminded of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e @-@ comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet was widely distributed over the photos that the filter was &quot; hur@@ ting and bar@@ k , was unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face was pulled into the de@@ bil@@ it@@ ating extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling wire .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in the race than their older opponents - might rather go out to expect sensitivity .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters produces an image that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it is much harder to keep such things un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for the medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account , asking others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that they believe that ra@@ cial controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that largely un@@ answered Snap@@ chat .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it rejected Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man the company recently set up a personnel responsible , focusing on under@@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu , in turn , said she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership frau@@ dul@@ ent IS@@ IS intelligence information , establishes Committee of the Congress
military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions were allowed on site , an investigation committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Members of the Army Committ@@ ees , Intelligence Committ@@ ees and Con@@ scription Com@@ mit@@ es , reports of great dis@@ content among Central Command intelligence agencies , who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence information , typically taken from high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated K@@ en Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership mistakes in Cent@@ com reach the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows in detail ongoing problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government spi@@ kes under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts faced pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw a more optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements in front of the Congress were much more positive than it meets the facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com associate publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force to life after it was played that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are under way through the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the news service committee published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com created an exc@@ essively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced the highest @-@ level democr@@ at in the Committee , a member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the moral of analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dispro@@ portion@@ ately little room for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Shi@@ p and the democr@@ ats reported not to have found any hints at the intervention of the White House in Cent@@ Com analysts regarding a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; definite political opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor , who were admitted to Cent@@ com analysts &apos; complaints .
l@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokes@@ man of the Pentagon , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment any reports of the Congress , while the investigations of the chief inspec@@ tor were still under way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important themes of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , last year &apos;s accus@@ ations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the Secret Information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush opposed the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker states that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation since these temporary refin@@ eries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ Com dam@@ al@@ iger Commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature for its exc@@ essively positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US wins fourth match in women &apos;s field ho@@ ckey , a show@@ down with the UK is ahead
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five doors in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember it ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in mind .
but she knows that : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and they are the same in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain un@@ defeated .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of them will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed will go a little longer to the strong Dutch woman who will lead the other group .
whatever the game on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed at last London games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey ra@@ cket in her hands ( her two older sisters playing sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the K@@ ader .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything was going on for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the National Team , began turning things to a better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ am said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have the Ru@@ dder to w@@ ander around completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the pe@@ at in the first half of the game with a back@@ stop from the local area .
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and le@@ aked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final door in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the entire tournament for the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympics .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff , which is handed down from the wrist to the tri@@ ath@@ lete to float to the tri@@ ath@@ lete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbour in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ ather@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympics and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could well be among these well @-@ known names that were sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ c@@ ers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it reign for a long time .
but if I &apos;m modest enough to make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it was so spar@@ sely perceived that many of them , I had asked , did not know that it was a Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an ath@@ lete until 2012 , who managed it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend this year &apos;s Gold Med@@ al from London .
the trampoline bed has a certain out@@ sider charm , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ lown school than that sounds for the Olympics .
at this point I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but a bound enthusi@@ ast .
it has a humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ical trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the grace of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stepping stone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging vic@@ tors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ itting and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
according to official Olympic Games , they are assessed according to execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alists hoping to go far@@ ther , faster , up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down on the playground .
they do not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the starting wall , but also a further highlight in TV transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord .
the goal @-@ oriented quest is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel as a bit ti@@ ring even when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing break .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she jumps off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upwards , then downward , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , not a wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition can only be in the Olympic Games .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming around 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the ang@@ ling and the objective of male athletes - as the male US gymn@@ asts suggested recently - according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits its new fan community .
&quot; one generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses testified that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police at shot exchange .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
over the past ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests erup@@ ted against the government and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organizations , the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed on ump@@ teen un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos about the protests , which are presumably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror attacks beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations continued to supp@@ ress repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dissi@@ dents effectively put to silence .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the des@@ erts of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you op@@ press people and have no other options except protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ e Tes@@ home , a teacher in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation is prot@@ esting .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold on the power of the ruling coalition .
after a widely critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time tensions rise along the border with Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o liberation front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been en@@ forced more or less in recent years , could protect and re @-@ arm the turbul@@ ence .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness now explo@@ de under the surface of H@@ ink@@ öch@@ el@@ ns under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with social media because cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide wherever they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians believed that they were so close to protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons of time , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia predominantly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy as they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but even this is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to coordinate under a umbrella , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military , secret services , commerce and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 , was 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well @-@ vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of North Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he enjoys not the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had experienced such a revol@@ t was in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which , according to the analysts , were apparently distra@@ c@@ ted by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of ri@@ ots went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , and for their meas@@ urable progress in fighting poverty .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mal@@ practice of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it adop@@ ts a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ using city , managed by Tig@@ ray and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for scheduled flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin emig@@ ration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declares his claim Obama had founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to dissi@@ p@@ ate the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday , fear@@ ing that his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication raises new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ cans &apos;s presidential candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and intelli@@ gently with the American public .
it also brings together his fellow campaig@@ ners who endeav@@ our to take protection during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position to explain the statements he could not have meant at all .
after having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump re@@ marked with reference to the claim on Thursday and insist@@ ed in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump told he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , on which Mr. Tr@@ ump told in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative radio pres@@ enter Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr Obama wants to destroy IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know about it .
the last storm of criticism sm@@ as@@ sel@@ t on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign because of falling transfer values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject .
talking about Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he drew a lot of criticism when he said the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he said , &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic borders in politics and then to recru@@ it as needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his ways to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , how they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more corro@@ sive tone , since its poll@@ s have gone further .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general tries not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his sense of hum@@ our .
but while he emphas@@ ises the attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal fellow comb@@ at@@ ants into the uncomfortable situation to face him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements might be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , was struggling to defend candidates today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Giuli@@ ani , so he asked about the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS an almost unknown , small organization , he called them am@@ bus@@ h@@ ers , completely wrong , and that &apos;s why it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most of the Ma@@ instream Republi@@ cans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs , allowed IS@@ IS to spread to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively .
before the election campaign events held in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of going around on any of his words and being bi@@ ased against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
once upon the price of the market , café in Green@@ point returns
Ver@@ b Cafe was a cand@@ y cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay bar , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices came from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front .
the shop So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , which replaced Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people rob@@ bed it as the last loss in a genetically modified city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel Exclu@@ sive and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if New York is change , then it &apos;s new .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he began to work with Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide money for a new field , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things .
Ver@@ b uses the same Distribut@@ or for Bag@@ els purchased the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nis@@ hes like cap@@ ers and sau@@ erk@@ ed onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no beer anymore , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in the past and visited the verb regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point she would take the path .
after the club closed , she gave up coffee drinking a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was on the coffee and culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , although she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on this day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before work and inevitably ordered the same thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients into the menu .
nowadays , Ros@@ enthal is still getting his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment at the fact that the soap shop occupied the old business area .
in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ w@@ ed coffee of the coffee shop as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go into their offer yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer transl@@ ates the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he pre@@ tended to release them soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a nearby building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land ter@@ rap@@ ie soup .
its menu on that day was slightly more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , mas@@ hed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Ziegel@@ man talks about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a repor@@ ter at the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , sn@@ app@@ y snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key ate with mas@@ hed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
when the repor@@ ter h@@ ack@@ ed h@@ ack@@ ed , this couple found the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
men of women cooked for male fel@@ lows and it was served freshly baked past@@ as for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; draws the ways with which the country was going to be no longer the country of land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans became a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Co@@ e why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food , such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ies , became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole re@@ used as a &quot; wonderful species , food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; bri@@ ck@@ man noticed that coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rarely servi@@ ced luxury .
odd mixtures have been tried , as a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction takes preced@@ ence over taste or even sound cooking .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from that period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular additive at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or ever since , budget econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have beha@@ ved like this in the country &apos;s eating habits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house@@ keeping politicians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to meet the challenge of transforming P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a festival of historic treats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially tasty are the reports on the government &apos;s response to the star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake food attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa Far@@ mers house kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke as the million @-@ million man of the world he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and carried a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was really a stranger to reality .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had called upon him to cancel an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the hypo@@ c@@ rites of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt suggested that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most dr@@ astic prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country came back to the legs .
the legacy is based on our continuing focus on calories and food , &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food .
the couple had better understood the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example , how they could not throw food away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was really sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind @-@ bag incident .
after the plates were cleared from Eisen@@ berg &apos;s place , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , the President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had lunch at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , adding that it was a common trick to miss a modest name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ ved something reluc@@ t@@ antly into the t@@ ame , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it ta@@ sted not bad .
Co@@ E got a repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A couple of chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life at stake to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died at a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil defence group who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 6@@ 0,000 people alive .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life on the game in order to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the field of war .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil defence , showing him during an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero , he never saw himself , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me it is the true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die in saving life , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dump@@ ed four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing difficulties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the toxic rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so that children don &apos;t play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture quotes his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland hair usually comes to the surface only in winter .
after an investigation , this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland hair is only 150 years old .
lei@@ surely , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1,@@ 220 meters far .
only when it arrives , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle dominated by lon@@ el@@ iness seems to be a god@@ father for a high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least from a Greenland shar@@ k , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein at the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock commented on this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evolutionary bi@@ ologist probably thought that Greenland will be st@@ ony .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland &apos;s ha@@ y is difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks .
they measured their slow motion when they made six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
nevertheless , prey make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may ch@@ ase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice sea and seek car@@ c@@ asses that tor@@ kel from higher water @-@ layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ y , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 50@@ 2 cen@@ timeter in size .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons attempt to im@@ pe@@ de large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
the l@@ enti@@ er , on the other hand , contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers . in 2012 , it was likely to celebrate its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
on the other hand , all major Greenland @-@ ha@@ vo@@ ys had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lens nucle@@ us , which is generated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Gr@@ ön@@ land shar@@ k , while the record Ha@@ i should be even 3@@ 92 years old with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
that Greenland @-@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland &apos;s hair with the multip@@ lication becomes apparent at least one and a half centuries .
this is also likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
the fact that such methane em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is not a coinci@@ dence .
the previous record holder , a 211 years old Greenland wh@@ ale , in whose bac@@ on on the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon point , was captured before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there is often also running on a flame .
so they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal bu@@ ys heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible early as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
a very large animal should , on the other hand , invest its resources in a long life .
building site in double pack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with topics relating to building , the municipal council has focused mainly on the recent meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Board accepted the announcement by Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of newly designated residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sale of plots in residential buildings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; street weg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( section 1 ) to the interested parties has nothing to do with interested parties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the land areas in the rural and quiet residential community appeal to young families and old sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , volunteers can now announce themselves in the Town Hall , the allocation of the plots will probably be advised by the Municipal Council in its September session .
in order to also en@@ roll en@@ quiries about sett@@ ling other commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the council decided to change the land use plan which was newly created in the spring of this year .
in the sub @-@ zeit@@ lar@@ n area , the business area already shown there is extended by two par@@ c@@ els towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
according to this , the city of the Main has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Competence Center for Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether banks will be allowed to continue operating from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is enough for them to be admitted to the UK .
these are just big US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , like the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) is talking about the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Super@@ vision E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk cor@@ ps ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Luxembourg has a large fund industry , however , it deterior@@ ates poor@@ ly with the infrastructure in the same way as Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
the city also points out easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the Business Consul@@ t@@ ancy Mer@@ cer , the city was ranked 7th , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European inland market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , econom@@ ists .
according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , and in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal expenses from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. magi@@ strate decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of the legal expenses arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ te C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was released from a compensation install@@ ment of $ 200 million for the infrin@@ gement of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were linked to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ingen and other un@@ ethical conduct .
when the complaint was raised on Thursday , US Secretary of State , Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman , said that Gilead ab@@ used the costs incurred during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead , which domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications , which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained to each other and claimed property on laboratory work with Sof@@ os@@ h@@ enko , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
forces supported by the US say that they have reg@@ ained full control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops supported by the United States have reg@@ ained full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
the demo@@ cra@@ cies of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters that have under@@ min@@ ed themselves within the city , are currently the city .
they have freed more than 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters was alli@@ ed with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are just running clean@@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published their tax return on Friday for 2015 , which resulted in the candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated $ 5.3 million in Rede@@ mption ; the former foreign minister gave an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book about her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declar@@ ations for the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hi@@ des behind false pron@@ ounc@@ ements and re@@ pul@@ sion regarding his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations .
it is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , although they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in terms of the release of the candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Ad@@ vis@@ ors , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax inspections are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Cri@@ tics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding wealth , donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business units and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and published a video on Friday in the Internet where high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump asks to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke also during a speech about the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done during the last decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ ump did not pay for two years or very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday that this could still be the case .
federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor war@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that individuals pay more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka asked Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat here to exchange Tr@@ ump to a meeting to discuss their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had also been subjected to an I@@ RS tax audit and had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of voters and not from tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ tons Camp@@ aig@@ n has published tax returns until 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Clin@@ tons currently living in Ch@@ app@@ aqua , New York , on average paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tax return &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; showed that only USD 100 of its income earned it as wage , unlike most Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , Fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
wildlife prot@@ ectors in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going in people inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them which are filled with ch@@ ill@@ i powder .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had the idea for years , has intensified their promotion together with the U.S. natural protection by training volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and harvest without hur@@ ting animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the world phone day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities without har@@ ming the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the eleph@@ ants &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chil@@ ly cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ill@@ i powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , the end of which is turned to the ignition cord .
when lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust in the air .
a hint is usually already out to ch@@ ase the elephant .
a last possibility is a th@@ row@@ er that sho@@ ots a gol@@ fing fire@@ works into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .

however , the city council now unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the construction of a sales office on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine bal@@ kon@@ s in the construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in an exposed location on the Rhine bank , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director dis@@ integrates Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ selection was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invitation - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin had not listed any Israeli pre @-@ selection since it had requested Arabic guests according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issued his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the hotel &apos;s list of countries .
the country , however , was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
he wrote to Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was even more fur@@ ious in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were app@@ alled and upset by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the internet , in which people called the whole a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indul@@ ged in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arabic guests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a Syn@@ agog@@ ue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly rejected all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct assignment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel did not enter the quick election list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police relies on tear gas &amp; rub@@ bers against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ ges against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the fact that the police put rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over their plans .
according to the governor of the Federal State Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the protest participants were spra@@ yed against the preliminary President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the most recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the previous year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest on the side of Russian companies in the country grew strongly , the ambassador announced .
Russian companies are taking up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further trade show is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade up@@ swing was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan assumes a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign representative gave about 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily to travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , as far as the number of tourists in Russia is concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes to change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
looking for witnesses : beverage market in Wald@@ br@@ öl exceeds
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack on Thursday evening has been carried out on the Be@@ we XXL drink market at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
in the event of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people who had m@@ um@@ med their faces were asked by the staff of the beverage market to pick up cash and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
the police did not share how much money was captured .

the joy@@ ous group was accommod@@ ated during the first week of school during the first week of school .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand we went to B@@ ane with the visit of the pet zoo .
to the other , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guidance in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third trip took us to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group was enjoying the deep @-@ sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and sp@@ lashing .
for culinary purposes , children and car@@ ers were treated with their own prepared body@@ shells such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops , be@@ ati@@ fied , beautiful jewelry made of beads and stones were created or made of wood a Roman grin@@ der game .

on the day of the journey home , the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and young people returned satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Do@@ or of Mer@@ cy
the regi@@ stran@@ ts from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together four stages were dealt with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to bridge the time until the next &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pil@@ gri@@ mage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of all the regi@@ stran@@ ts in probably two years , the round of government of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a long @-@ day pilgri@@ m hike . &quot; &quot; &quot;
various pilgri@@ ma@@ ges have been tested and one finally decided for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the opened gate of mercy on Freiburg Min@@ ster , a special pilgrimage destination was offered .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the holy rooms , went on their way .
in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration at St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m crosses and spread the pilgri@@ m &apos;s blessing .
from Hor@@ b you went by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where there was also a Min@@ ster of Our Lady standing and so the pilgrimage was taken away from Münster .
the individual day tours were surrounded by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and texts in the morning and evening .
but even on the way , the Min@@ is made a stop at Mar@@ ches , chap@@ els or churches to sing together a song of specially assembled pilgrims song .
par@@ is@@ hi@@ on@@ ers of the local par@@ is@@ hi@@ on@@ ers were at their disposal for the overnight stays .
at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller managed to have a tasty and even stronger dinner and breakfast .
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the day after that , the stage was taken to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but had to climb up to about 500 metres in the heat and then get heard afterwards .
the deser@@ ved reward was a common barbecue at the swimming pond in the evening .
after the morning pulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , we went to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg cathedral in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy .
with a small impulse God thank@@ ed God .
the Min@@ is arrived at the evening mass in Münster by co@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t .
after the divine service the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the metropolis metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back by train to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow occupied the anch@@ or@@ age that his fellow coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself to E@@ igen . the J@@ umping and made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to conc@@ eal a victory from the favorites of New Zealand .
England claimed a shock@@ ing victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after seeing only a modest sixth place in March at the railway world champi@@ onships in London despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ys retired produced a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ du , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner comp@@ eted in the qualification round an Olympic ch@@ ord , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap , Hin@@ di was almost back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , in which Hin@@ des went in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ du , when they climbed onto the pe@@ dest@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an Olympic ch@@ ord in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 at the site Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no appeal by England &apos;s rival .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ du said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team over the past three months .
we &apos;ve come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the cycle of bikes .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y who was also born on 23 March ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same as Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go for three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win on your own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two other gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilomet@@ re race .
they reached the target in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record that won gold in London in 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had argued yesterday with officials before the qualification when function@@ aries were calling him to measure his body size .
in the corresponding Women &apos;s Competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a medal of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional depic@@ tion of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
they played in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical leader Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and bul@@ b@@ bing and retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation G@@ Bs that has reached its peak at the perfect moment could be repeated again .
future of the mel@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of energy consumption
the future of the aluminum melt from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus will raise all supply contracts as the supplying energy company announced .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy set for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed during a closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melt consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa joined the point Henry melt , which last year led to a closure of the fishing industry .
the Al@@ coa melt in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melt with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , indicated that three further owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p are holding smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L expects the plant to continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by the melt , &quot; said the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L further said that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the fiscal year will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L revenues from G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L announced that the value of the contracts has already been written down in its annual budget of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expectation of termination &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the Tre@@ aties , the &quot; Ab@@ ility of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; did not harm .
the US company said that it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang which would have entered into force from November this year even if there is still an explanation why it has res@@ ig@@ ned from the contract .
analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry prior to the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 MW and Tom@@ ago to consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and it wouldn &apos;t be good for us as a generator , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vog@@ ue
San Antonio J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vog@@ ue .
San Antonio , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the view brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Antonio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans like ? ) , wei@@ rd reality video showing the whole Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ en@@ ner family ( except the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as they forget the cover of their sister and that ended with a classic turn : they all planned a surprise party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é deed of almost every birthday party of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the phrase , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of Vog@@ ue , a new era of Kar@@ d@@ hi@@ ans has begun with certainty .
Kend@@ al &apos;s big sister Kim likes her beating the Vog@@ ue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vog@@ ue .
with a circum@@ ference that rather resembles a picture tape than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were 6@@ 15 pages of advertising from the 8@@ 32 pages of the ram@@ zer ) .
the disclosure of its cover star is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still leak before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
over the past few years , there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , mo@@ wers &quot; than &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover .
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer La@@ wr@@ ence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls below the earlier category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success to everyone .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always something exciting .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called her &quot; the mist@@ y pieces of the moment . &quot;
these feelings co@@ d up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue cover .
but walking around on the mo@@ m seems to pass at the point .
San Antonio J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of Vog@@ ue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ ming of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters will sell you pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is seen in Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
community centres annually reject 16@@ 0,000 people
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aid needs are reported annually by the Centers of Peace , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further mean cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - have been rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ utilized , are prepared for further cuts .
as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds .
the director of the community centres of Que@@ bec James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Centers of Churches revealed that thousands of people have already been exp@@ elled every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without repe@@ aling the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families that have been released by separ@@ ations , workers who have been released un@@ just - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut resources by 30 percent , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the General Prosecutor and Federal Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately susp@@ end these short@@ cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the provincial government met its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump El@@ ection Camp@@ aig@@ n indic@@ ted after workers allegedly drag@@ ged gun
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign was accused of alleged in@@ action after it was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina put a gun on one of her employees in February , while in February they were on the road in a je@@ ep .
the incident is described in an indictment , which was filed on Wednesday in the Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i agreed to have been waiting for months that the matter would be regulated internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drew a gun , put his right hand on the de@@ duction , and batter@@ ed the barrel in Vinc@@ enzo &apos;s knee , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i in his accus@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compl@@ aining with the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosecution only comes two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a ri@@ ot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and arms bud@@ dies - should take action if his Ri@@ val@@ in H@@ illary Clinton is elected and judge should appoint judges .
Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words from the context and that he would not viol@@ ate violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for violation of due dili@@ gence and from Philip for bodily injury and lasting psychological damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps press spokesperson Hope Hi@@ cks was not able to reach an opinion .
attempts to contact Philip just failed .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign .
on calls from his consulting firm , Innovative Consulting Services , was not re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has brought a controversial campaign so far .
the procedure is B@@ ordin@@ i by Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : poll@@ s before country elections : lo@@ osing the SPD and CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for the governing parties of the SPD and CD@@ U are apparent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the North could not rule further , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to face the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party was only margin@@ ally ahead of the CD@@ U , which again could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag .
despite light losses , the Gre@@ ens returned to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite slight losses ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 per cent each .
according to the survey , the election of the SPD in Berlin would only be 23 percent ( 2011 election : 28.@@ 3 per cent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they thus lag behind the Gre@@ ens at 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would , on the other hand , miss the move in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : the Nokia Communic@@ ator was launched 20 years ago .
the success@@ ors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather pal@@ pit@@ ous .
initially , the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gigab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the stores - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , lovers can buy the devices on the Internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; office in the west pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to receive a lot for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , al@@ beit slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , about 1400 Euros .
the average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could fores@@ ee in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the mobile phone division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and wound up to Microsoft .
today , vendors are able to control the market every much later than Nokia .
being online anytime and anywhere , this is everyday life for a lot of people .
there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide in 2015 .
about 1.4 billion units sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
the worldwide turnover of the devices is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , everything via touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s victory proc@@ ession began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the look@@ out .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ w now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
in average , every German now watches 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to put the Smartphone away once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity all over the country not only in our local communities and throughout London .
for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we will have already 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ rows is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ ass ourselves on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ ged 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every asked question .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for single an infrastructure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , to create £ 211 billion in hybrid growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the UK .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz und Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software vendors try to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scratch and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post , in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to further block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that its desktop page would change coding for its advertisements in order to make it difficult to detect the detection on which part of the site is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blog post the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ battle between the offensive open source community and the hang@@ ers has already been underway since the invention of ad block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying trends have become the industry .
worldwide , according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , employ some 200 million people ad blo@@ cker ; almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenues .
the company has no effect on desktop PCs because mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook mobile apps for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , a spokes@@ man shared .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook seems to be worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their targeted advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Facebook maintained that Ad@@ block would cause new filters to be wor@@ rying , because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , so instead we focused on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of the people .
woman persu@@ aded suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman was driven off on a motorway in the early morning hours on Thursday at a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d just after midnight .
a woman laid down in the Dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police told in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss in the age of 49 , who was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she still died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police told them and every witness of the incident to report .
an investigation process was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that the drivers are not held accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway as it was said in the newspaper .
last year a police officer was acqu@@ itted after having gone over and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has become unconscious in the street , condemned the court .
the court found that the police -- who had responded to an emergency call -- drove on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus once was inhab@@ itable
according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies from NASA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether or not Venus could have shown similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and still rot@@ ated slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of the Venus is exposed to its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today .
the model produced a story of Venus that resembles evolution previously thought by planet researchers .
although it was presumably inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burnt away by ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide left behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy res@@ ig@@ ned on Thursday as coach and vice president of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; in the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
during the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth that it needs and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the trainer &apos;s vision and vice president Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the best coach of the League during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the last season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches featured a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell by five points behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ sten , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
North des@@ ee@@ pers take talks again , strike out strikes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles regarding wages for North Sea workers are exposed , while all parties sit down at the table for a new round of discussions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil @-@ field service provider Wood Group were conducted spor@@ adic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions , can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold a few full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks that will start in the beginning of next year in order to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released tens of thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure because of the lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish Parliament committee , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
less than $ 1.4 billion in spending for new projects in the North Sea will be expected in 2016 compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ dre@@ am@@ esk@@ op has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the Ple@@ j@@ ades cluster .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the con@@ stell@@ ations rotate to different rates as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods are with planet origin .
&quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other con@@ stell@@ ations , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Centre in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the fastest .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , these att@@ acking stars reach large amounts of con@@ stell@@ ations .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than a few massive stars .
ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars turn slower tracks than smaller ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal Cos@@ mic Laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is still much ahead of us about what we want to learn more about how , when and why stars slow@@ ed down their rot@@ ational rates and hang their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so to speak . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball Star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of base to base .
after his emotional res@@ ignation , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will face the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys last time the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying good@@ bye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has been awarded $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will work as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid off for a long time with power .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 score for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es made some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys only two other bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be admitted to the Hall of Gl@@ ory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field so controversial is his appearance outside the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as early as 2009 , the super@@ star joined &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to have taken away any forbidden ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games by the end of 2014 due to the involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the principal suspect , for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a dispute the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for me in 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his f@@ arewell @-@ days don &apos;t run sil@@ ently .
while many bas@@ eball legends receive the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relations with pop star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , received sympathy of fans from Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Arch@@ riv@@ ale Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the supporters sang at 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing attacks .
a learned ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing incidents in Rio de Janeiro have become known .
Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obstacle @-@ runner Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positively in Brazil and ruled out - immediately before the start of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions this news arrives at the time .
in Ch@@ en the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de has been proven last Sunday which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
the International sports court CA@@ S confirmed the exp@@ ul@@ sion of the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had finished fourth in the fin@@ als over 100 m of butter@@ flies , only about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en would have had a 50 m free style in the runs .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the issue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands Ch@@ en &apos;s full co @-@ operation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news spread about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ath@@ lete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the banned substance is expected to act as a means of blood dop@@ ing .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample was also expected to be positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately announced his criticism with criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for instance , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation may not participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; known as the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested positive for three days earlier than his brother Tom@@ as@@ z on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both deny the intake , but both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of athletes , especially the case of Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF World Association banned the launch of the entire Russian squ@@ ad , except for systematic dop@@ ing , and the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the previous off@@ ences in China also took care of violent clas@@ hes between the athletes .
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang harsh .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m free style , I want to pass over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun also focused on a confrontation with Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 , Sun had a positive effect on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din in the Chinese Championship , but had to lose only a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : as per@@ fi@@ de , h@@ ack@@ ers black@@ mail their ran@@ som
developers of black@@ mail malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and they are successful .
according to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes below 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surv@@ eyed companies in the last twelve months were at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the charges required by the perpetr@@ ators to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize in attacks on corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to replace ran@@ som is considerably higher than with private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling fast evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most malware programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for itself .
first of all , private users were the goal , but the change to company att@@ acking took place in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als permanently .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the final code to the files , the victim must transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryp@@ to@@ gram Bit@@ coin .
but where private users use the personal photo database at stake , companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production stops .
accordingly , the damage falls if a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 per cent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to inter@@ rupt their business operations , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany several hospitals were already victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of down@@ time in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers in turn know this and try everything to build up a good reputation .
in a recent study , F @-@ Secure safety researchers have examined the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , free accessible support websites or deci@@ ph@@ ering for free sample files .
and if private individuals are redeemed after payment of a few hundred euros , companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data back un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively high @-@ risk profits from ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion , h@@ ack@@ ers are becoming ever more professional and share the work , says Security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits were created by purchasing malware itself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included in delivery is a fitting tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ mail@@ ers then seek further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so one logs in one of the boards underground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of the company &apos;s IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey rely on the ability to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanning software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery , the perpetr@@ ators are threatened instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declares Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the potential for damage is much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a block@@ aded heating could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda plans to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and even the versatility of a mini van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear , it does not work in any place .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top is a little off .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l with raised and 10@@ 26 l with inver@@ ted back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a seat and offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the load height is 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide @-@ speed ranges .
however , he should do his work slightly qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another motor@@ isation : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment does not leave any wishes un@@ fulfilled in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the city emergency brake assist ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when maneu@@ vering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote @-@ light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller respon@@ ds to the traffic sign recognition and throt@@ tles the speed when required .
but full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday vehicle .
airline is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
the airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Higher Regional Court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable in case of danger that is typical of air traffic .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee cap during the fall .
but the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such that the court .
the airline had to pay no damages to the husband .
cases of illness : when the organis@@ er pays
after their trip , sick leave only get money back when the cause of the disease can be found without a doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
during the trial , a family on the second day of their Turks was severely ill with diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their disease caused the vac@@ ation@@ ers to return to a defective wastewater treatment plant which was supposed to pol@@ lu@@ te the sea@@ water .
the family believed that the trip was lacking - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
before the court , the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
indeed , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before the departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then , he had to assume that sea@@ water was al@@ right .
so he did not viol@@ ate his information obligations , so the judgment .
no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion - is a common risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined at the same time to react to terrorism .
certainly , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and split .
we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country more quickly , the security and strength will also increase the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère aims to implement proposals for 2017 .
he also announced a further personnel strengthening of the security forces , namely &quot; in medium @-@ four @-@ digit magnitude over several years . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must once again be punished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance is to be improved , the weapon law will be amended so that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is more difficult .
the most recently discussed sec@@ rec@@ y obligation for doctors is to be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , how to reduce the danger of citizens , he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities .
in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alisation of refugees , the minister has a better social support necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister spoke clearly against action .
&quot; this was an ear@@ thing for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double nationality before .
he considers a general prohibition of full @-@ wear to be un@@ constitutional .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
talk about rules about street traffic or for witnesses in court .
green boss Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister of simul@@ ating force and ability to act with new anti @-@ terror packages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right of residence bring people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
it st@@ alls regularly on the road@@ side - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal defl@@ ection should be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who are driving in traffic on the ambient street every night , when they drive over the motorway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , road construction will be extended by 700 metres between the Hammer Road and the Wes@@ eler Street downhill .
drivers can then turn right from the hammer road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is getting up early , which improves the overall course of time on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District Council of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder is annoying the drivers between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the way back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ va way and sometimes also extends beyond that .
the reason for this is the needle @-@ eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Street .
from here , traffic is only guided by lane over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back over a quarter of a century ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the required load capacity , in order to absorb the heavy duty traffic in two lanes .
the competent regional operation cannot say how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the connected work@@ day traffic jam will continue .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official remaining term of use by 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal stay , the state company deliberately chose the weaker period during school holidays because there are disabilities to be expected .
traffic is passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural travel : cultural offerings for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Forest School visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are planning a musical project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima , 19 pupils from 11 to 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the Small House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Mu@@ en@@ ster within the framework of this project .
most of the young people in the class have come to Mu@@ en@@ ster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and would speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , such as the press release of the Young Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from spra@@ yer , and the Young Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background will receive the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical communication are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the star @-@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern a line through the bill during the night of Germany - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the sky spectacle , said the Chairman of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many stars in the sky .
the star scales are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest shooting stars .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , one rolls around for hours , at night , one is awake for hours , in the morning it is far ahead of the alarm @-@ ring@@ ing no longer to think of sleep .
this is anything but rest@@ ful .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of the adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleeping problems manifest or sleep disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons underlying them , stresses Hans @-@ Günter Tit@@ sch , a member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
however , the in@@ som@@ nia , therefore an in@@ tran@@ ce and sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , is what one understands .
when sleeping , many people feel un@@ satisfactory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , member of the board of the German House Association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this can be organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medication .
in@@ frequently , sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is frequent in a depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Na@@ oko . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors require one another .
for example , if you have a disk failure , it can be bad , wake up every two or three hours and begin to pon@@ der on everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go with sleep disorders to the doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week , should go to the doctor , tell a doctor .
the impair@@ ment may look quite different : you are beaten , tired , un@@ rested , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like ga@@ stri@@ c or headache .
to allevi@@ ate sleeping disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
in Germany , low @-@ settled medical professionals hardly exist , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary dormit@@ ory of the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin .
for this reason , one should first contact the family doctor in case of sleeping problems , advis@@ es Dr .
it can be clari@@ fied with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab , and what happens ?
for examination in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise , for example , snor@@ ing with respiratory suffer@@ ers , in case of abnormal ti@@ redness , in case of sleep @-@ conver@@ ters , or if one does not find the cause of a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , explains Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just do not make a mid@@ day sleep , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the disgu@@ ise , one goes to bed at his normal time .
besides the electrodes of the body , one carries a nose pair , a chest strap and a sensor at the finger .
in addition , a camera stands on the ceiling of the sleeping @-@ ends .
how can anybody get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can set for a better sleep .
it counts : regular sleep and stopping times , not to sleep long in bed , don &apos;t sleep on the day , do not watch TV to fall asleep , avoid drinking alcohol and not watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not at all con@@ duci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for dis@@ appointment of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he made gold for the first time at the World Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time represented his first world record .
now , the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has stood out in front of his ex @-@ te@@ amm@@ ate who stood in the criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle king 15@@ 0,000 € , no one should wonder about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page last night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in the swimming pool is bad , but dop@@ ing controls are very good .
this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and not exactly see or even operate dop@@ ing on the topic of dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be registered already nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cannot control a certain amount of time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , you may not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the choice @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile runs an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of luggage tag arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , Ci@@ vili@@ ans of the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the susp@@ ects had committed several bags and pil@@ es of luggage as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 p.m. , civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf Airport detected a gang that was known to the police officers from past theft .
since the middle of July this year , the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences .
the Speci@@ alists of the Criminal Com@@ miss@@ ariat of Criminal Law 34 can prove four acts specifically for the crimes committed by criminal off@@ ences in Germany .
in total , they had caught a total of more than 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few Lin@@ den@@ bä@@ um@@ chen , in between are still a rest cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not appear in the first sight , but the police force them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one gets past play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was spra@@ yed on the façade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite of a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed soon , is already being built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain calls , will be illustrated in recent weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants have rental contracts , but in the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin internal sen@@ ator Henkel has advoc@@ ated for a hard action by the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the cad@@ a@@ vers , had been cleared with 300 police officers , pat@@ rol the police for three weeks , according to official statements , locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
in the meantime , construction workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown house owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers mar@@ ched under the che@@ ering of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the street works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain in front of Sp@@ ä@@ ti .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left Viol@@ ence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who has three children here , are especially anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the residents of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , which mainly wished police protection from the v@@ and@@ ali@@ atory left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police make up between the house occup@@ iers and their neighbours , obviously does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class neighborhood , which today , compared to the rest of the city , has a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße in the vicinity of the Riga Zoo .
while the Main@@ zer had been swe@@ pt under a large police array in a real street battle , many of the projects in Riga were leg@@ alized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and poll@@ s from all over the world over the past few years : with them , residents from GDR times and former hous@@ em@@ akers are now sharing their neighbourhood .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them on win@@ dow@@ ed slices or freshly painted facades , which were thrown with paint bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year so often along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to look at this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences such as bodily injury follow statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the criminal off@@ ences constitute alleg@@ ations that tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a house for 17 years next to the disputed 94 , there can be no talk about uncertainty .
as for violence , it is wei@@ ghty : people in the 94 are their neighbors , who have not been that .
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the architect , her street is not a criminal record , on the contrary : &quot; here you can help each other , live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously moved to the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße - and remained .
that is why it was so important to her that the residents get back their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all of a sudden demanded the interpretation sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former building gaps that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - people here are more people who are not so well searched &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can absolutely not make violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what to do if someone never list@@ ens to it ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding of conc@@ entri@@ c ones , who anno@@ y themselves about color bombs : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who draw near should be aware - just like someone who walks in a pub area , can complain about noise there .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee camp
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ue supports the management team around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , working groups , refugees , administration , authorities and anyone else involved .
Reg@@ ine client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is here , the van@@ ishing wo@@ olen milk @-@ sau , which has a problem above all .
thus some - less mo@@ cking but rather focused on the multitude of tasks desired - meant when administration wanted to write the job .
looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an aff@@ lu@@ ent wo@@ olen milk @-@ sau .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but administrative work is not their central area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has limited a 50 @-@ percent place for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are great and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
new containers will soon stand in the Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local authorities are responsible for the connection .
they have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations have to be borne by the local authorities .
the responsibility changes from the administrative office to the commun@@ e and the job centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it is not possible to rely on private dwell@@ ings , such as Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common flats have to be intim@@ i@@ dating as it is called so beautiful .
new containers will soon be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and employment opportunities for refugees and migrants who need to be gre@@ ased or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help master craftsmen , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers like sport , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
thus also administration and volunteers are also jumping here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they need to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
whoever will eventually develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , don &apos;t work and be useless , will never be integrated .
the clear majority is motivated .
but there are problems also , &quot; says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fear of radic@@ alisation after the recent incidents , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also the subject of the refugees .
they were afraid that the attacks would bring them up completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary officials will have to look for activities in the region and in the region .
they have always been in the background that soon a new strike of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
to answer this question clearly does not shy away from politics .
it is actually unfair to place them on the spot .
