<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer with some colleagues was looking for a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>

<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the riding career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer was the best golfer ever - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself be led with his family over the system of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even bother for photo-purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">German sporting aid handed over to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala, the Golden Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards to the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silver Lorlaurel leaf, Champions Tour Player of the year...</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential applicants are not one in the tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Der, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against the fact that the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wanted to control the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will push regulations massive, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Clinton, on the contrary, says:" "" "the state has to fulfil certain tasks, it has opportunities to open up discrimination and need money." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would be increased, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In order to invest, Trump and Clinton say almost verbally.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate has even announced the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical wing wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be party internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more distinct.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump aims to build coal-fired power plants and re-operate coal mining in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, and he wants to cancel the Paris climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend the renewable energies with their investment program and demand:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - the two competitors are not too far apart from each other even for international trade agreements.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better, including Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger-wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump in this question wants to do is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to rend up, then he says he may not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics believe him that the budget deficit would be even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton stands, who wants at least from the rich, that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="5">In a large kitchen there are four women.</seg>

<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the North of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for all-embraced women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs worked together with Pro Familia and the Munich women's help.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believe that when they arrive in Germany, they are mistaken, told Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and at worst abused.</seg>

<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">To the question whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their sphere of competence, some answer no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in the housing of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Also in Swabia alone, fleeing women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are several common shelters or own houses only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "representatives of the assistance specialists have called their union to approve new employment campaigns in their disputes with regard to a new contract." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more labour campaign measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC stated that ministers would have agreed to deal with the concerns of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, assistance specialists and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "alliance of outsiders" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can't resist the impression that Ankara wants to make this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed irresistible and hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained relationships.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a paper describing that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to be the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiating, sustained coolness showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the firing of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was staggering.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin condemned and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, since it was committed by a supposed boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the cousin becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The serious accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria's territories would have been controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place because Putin was apologizing to President Erdogan who he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily required to get all the friends he can get after the last month at a failed coup d "état of almost his office.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken it.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-seasonal attack on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the State television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti put it as follows:" "" "tourists there, tomatoes are here long" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West as it regards its response to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "the continued resentment on the snail tempo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian state of state won a bonus that he called for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, a matter of course that has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an "alliance of outsiders" to me, as an analyst once described me: two countries that are violated and treated badly by the West and are now united.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, in spite of the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they would not even have stripped the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately avoided responding to a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey dropped Russia's fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once more.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin recently released Sergei Ivanov's Chief of Staff.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of Putin's narrowest confidence circle for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement by the Kremlin it is that Putin ordered the release of Ivanovs from his duties as the chairman of the Russian presidential administration without giving reasons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been his deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin website, it is (in Russian) that he later served as Chief of the Staff and Chief of Staff of the Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the main task of the government to support your activity as Head of State on legislative proposals and controls to implement your statements." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mystical.</seg>
<seg id="15">For a long time, Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest confidant Vladimir Putins and works like him for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the ridicule for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is here the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was praised as potential president once upon a time would like to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin cited on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - weighty items to be trusted for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, as Putin former member of the State Security Service, KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin reached power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia since a third term of Putin violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close ally to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became the president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The €1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>

<seg id="7">The €1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>

<seg id="10">We are all witnessing an engineering of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck is now in Rosyth a concrete foot for the deck, which means that the deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>

<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower, we had to close the existing gap in the north or the country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>

<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 affordable apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">At the next meeting, the SPD is proposing a "housing concept."</seg>
<seg id="5">But controversy is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, it is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, a regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said S & D leader Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens: people who want to build on urban areas must reject 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments, however, can also arise in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "however, the big dispute in the town hall is, said Bratmann:" "" "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent in such areas, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, should provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, said Bratmann:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants investors to make as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants to impose tougher conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">No matter how viola, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market is taking place.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action plan is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which were to be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how can one compensate for the loss of more than 1300 affordable apartments, whose funding will run over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">There will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planning olithic spokeswoman Nicole Palm should now be bought out of the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought of bringing apartments back to the price.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western city, frists run at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the apartment building companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the west city is increased dramatically again, one is removed from the goal of so-called mixing.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socio-weak in just a few districts.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and children don't go out to play anymore, but rather prefer to spend their spare time staring on screens, was bemoaned by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially restricted to the TV, then on video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s (later, a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs) were created.</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand decreased slightly at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand that overburdened the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that will be tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photographed" (by a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the boat and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that cover the" "" "average" "" "person every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which pursues 35,000 users, recently informed the Washington Post with that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of follow-up people who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely sees raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take" "" "get 30 minutes of time" "", "" "" "coming from the sofa" "" "and" "" "being active every day" "" "bumped on deaf ears because many public messages are boring and coming from people that look elappointing." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical exercise helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoor that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also maces that have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit have already followed our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and the use will decrease with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and will help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all that.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant on a whole line.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast clumped on Thursday to the championship title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medalists and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medallist Aliya Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles turnt on the Swedish bar during the solo campaign of women in the gymnastics event at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-campaign title and overall the fifth while she reinforces her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment ended.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts it in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years, 15 world champions - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing practices that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rescue from her said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She was expecting a final exam in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after having won gold and silver in the individual multi-campaign inale of women at the Olympic Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark on the farewell party of Martha Karolyi, who was going to retire at the farewell party.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even though Biles insisted, during her long journey to the top, never to have planned the future, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gymnasium, trained in the Boorman, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has lost no more competition, a winning streak that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if mustafina led slightly through two turns, the picture was deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish beams and ground cloths - in which Biles holds the world title title - lauded.</seg>
<seg id="28">She recovered again with 15,433 on the Swedish bar - and sat on it with a 15,933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her softly as they expected her end-birth - a pure formality - and tears streamed on Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision that she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "this time the 22-year-old male capital, called" "" "Oma" "" "by the Americans, had a lead." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After her practice, she hurried to the audience kisses, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the rapidly expanding Tweet of the 19-year-old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who died in one of the deadliest attacks since a decade in the first mass murderous event of Phoenix, while they stopped in the car and listened to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>

<seg id="6">The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shootgun led investigators to take a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven persons were killed in nine attacks in hispanic residential areas within four months and two more injured.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "it happens in a residential area in front of a house," "" "said Howard of KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, beginning of the month." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">It is assumed that the suspects used several vehicles, including a brown nag from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators refused to disclose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on site.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report on the shooting which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the factory of the serial killer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine in the women's Olympic stadium in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, since 1984 I have been at every summer Olympics and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin colors.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewish is and Madison Kocian, the Catholic is to round off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among female gymnasts was an African-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, how they delivered unexpected but masterful Gymatikroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold in an individual multi-fight event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we don't look at gyms in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie did all the same way as Aly and Madison to join the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "last five" "", "because the next Olympic team will only have four female players in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But reality looks like gymnastics are a costly sport and gymnasts come primarily in private gymnastics that are maintained by parents who pay for training, orientation, travel apparel, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnouts lie in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts will receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started with gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give the churches aun innumerable, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easily accessible gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my turn foundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable hubs in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics to the youth, who earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, which brings thousands of young girls interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to take part in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true depiction of "Girl Power" by the holocaust of the Olympic team and thanks for having motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way of becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness makes electoral fraud flourishing in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutsk Rahman was removed last year due to the release of a government report for corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a devastating government report today disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town councils to have ignored proof of misuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, now an anti-corruption scandal, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to establish shut-off tapes outside of electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "he suggests that voters should lead an identification with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, a voter merely needs to call his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to apply non-removable ink on a person's finger when they vote their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>

<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets election scandal in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special court ruled that the incumbent mayor of Lutsk Rahman was to be relieved on corrupt and illegal practices of his office after a litany.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Rahman is said to have led" "" "his campaign" "" "on the basis that it is the religous duty of Muslims to choose him." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="18">He was particularly alarming in the fraudulent choice of letters - when older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, depicted, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including leading ID cards to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report it says: "evidence has been established that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elders, in particular communities with Pakistani or banglaic background.</seg>

<seg id="7">Beat him with the knee in the lath and twist, while the aggressor knocks against pain, the weapon from his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while they set the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright shabouts for a travel guide his tongue at the dirtiest places of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and stranglehold of a serious test by leaking some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk dropped his course on a euro note, a railing on the Piccadilly Circus, a hing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before checking out each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is getting involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed in the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea to check the rinsing button of a towing toilet that has been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey across Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he licked, more than a bad taste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "Mr Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowel by travelling through the world and eating odd and wonderful things." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations to washing up dumplings of toilets, the task posed its immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he did justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial version showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison to this, the luminometry number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a russian toilet that he refused to refuse after her luminometrial number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands show one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Mr. Wright and Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "", "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes close to the worst that I have oiled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more mutate than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here because it is indoors here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company provides Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valio Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at while explaining the advantages of probiotics at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we caused crazy brainstorming by saying that we told" "" "Lass us to call Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the film directing, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick them up and others, in which this was rather difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria in particular associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally using products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asozial family left their social housing after a delogization with a loss of £50,000 because it had terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After having been forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls showed plaintive holes, wooden planks were torn up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for home administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwalls.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons living in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted was street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, stripping and cursing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">Old trash was found in some rooms of the house, which may be demolished under certain circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden planks were torn up</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing deloiled her and her partner this week by force from the property after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogiation was cheered by lightened neighbours who said that their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "one said," "" "They weren't afraid for anyone." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="23">Now that they are finally gone, it will be beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said it would have cut off the family with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house, to which the police was called at regular intervals, for 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">Trash and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the community house.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the tenant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family, as delogization is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community courageously approached us and have provided us with the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20.</seg>

<seg id="33">Workers of the house management will now have to sweep away garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>

<seg id="35">Skeldon was fined after having found guilty of owning a drug of class B in trade.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who came to life in 2013 at a car accident.</seg>

<seg id="2">The IOC wants to establish a disciplinary commission.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kenya's athletes face the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee immediately announced a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan function told that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, gave a urine specimen in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-metre-runner Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leadership Kenias by the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF World Association has requested the IOC for information about the case in order to exert its own investigations, a IAAF spokesperson distributed.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "depending on the results of the investigation and the following actions of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," "" "he said in an IAAF statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and acted as Ferguson Rotich, handed over the sample and signed," explained Kenias Chief de Mission Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich has become a World Cup fourth in Beijing in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegation leader Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming doping tests.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he was reported to have been arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">Since some time in Kenya, the IOC has been under special observation after numerous times of doping.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls submitted by the IOC in front of the Rio games, it was previously pointed out that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">Before the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted a great deal of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, WADA Kenya accepted the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with the WADA rules.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is regarded as a major runner-nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">Athletes of the country won most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of television reports of the ARD, accusations were repeatedly raised that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant mentality of sports betting.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation into Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">It could be proven that this sport has been partially and systematically deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="26">Russian athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games.</seg>

<seg id="5">The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth room.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he warms.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have amber music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this staging Bartoli plays an older Mary.</seg>
<seg id="12">She recalls with melancholy her love with Tony, while the younger Lady is playing and dancing.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First, because it is musically exceptional!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">So it is wise, of course also naïve, and very passionate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it resembles me very much, my Italian character I have as Römerin," laughs Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer:" "" "Cecilia is a wonderful artist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">It is such an honour for us to work with it.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is an enormous human being.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "and Bartoli returns the compliment:" "" "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">You see it in each of his movements, in his looks, it is his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, that is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For American director Philip Wm. McKinley's "West Side Story" is up-to-date: "this piece deals with prejudice and fanaticism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we went to New York and the New York residents did not want them.</seg>
<seg id="29">They are the same subjects, and today they are just as meaningful as back then.</seg>
<seg id="30">59 years later the piece is still relevant.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the Parliament election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because stupid as so far it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and land-for-day elections - that is biting.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who want to be convinced by the election warriors, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers in the country, on the way to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so do not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during the holidays helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and end up voices just laborious.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and the last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again pass an election campaign close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, Leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strong new AfD intersects and what remains at the end of coalition dust.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous electoral campaign.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributes roses and chatting a little with the people, just as his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "her refugee policy, her" "" "We create this" "" "hastened the rise of the right-wing populists, which is now probably going to cost him the beautiful office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is, if one makes election campaign in the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited chancellor Angela Merkel to open classes twice; Merkel's federal election circuit is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Northeast-CDU largely dispenses with the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "this means coking, playing only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union has also noted that, on the country, its base will crumble, that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">You do it like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any present in the expanse of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU voter Kokert to his fellow combats is also self-revealing: "you must go where it hurt, namely where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is on the game, Sellering has now called its SPD a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Socialists and Democrats stood at 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the 2011 election, the SPD had already won with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Green Party, a small party with seven percent in the polls, will probably make the leap into the land.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they made everything pretty shacky," "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station." ""</seg>

<seg id="8">The award is also given to those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of right-hand descents.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen has been lifted and that the connection to Rottenburg will again exist, the traffic situation within the village has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The traffic passes through the place seems to go back.</seg>

<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstrasse, Hafnerstraße and Weihersals had to fight with more traffic noise because many sneaking routes were looking for and more familiar to their navi than the signs.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fraying.</seg>

<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27 reorganization has led to revenue fractures with them, everyone one asks to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>

<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the restaurants along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential threat.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all inns made it "hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>

<seg id="34">Half of his employees have to be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been here since 1715 and refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">It can be understood that other regular guests are now less frequently able to pass by because of the complicated traffic route.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you cannot approach it, it is also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his family-clientele returns after the end of the rehabilitation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 works on his clientele for the greatest crisis that his restaurant experienced in their long-standing history.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Sheets: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely middle aged men love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you hasten to the comment section to review it under the pseudonym non-allunity men of Middle-age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much talked about reformation of records does not lead to a boom in Millennials, who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a plate are all foresight at the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older record buyers still retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you agree with the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest gray suit and let go wild before I stop, hold my hands and say something better like: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I of Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three men of middle aged) to Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men of middle-aged, one woman, probably around the 20) follow, is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These vinyl records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and bought new items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60's, early 70's who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things in which I was probably something too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend some time alone, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets on the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media pump, people who have heard about comeback and are forced to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have conducted, people usually have settled around 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers contacted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, of objects that evoke happy jugenderings.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or property of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is as a collector so and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to get involved spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee flutes from a record stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned as I flatten up through a stack of bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three men of middle age) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone only came here recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead silencer so I can put them into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-consuming, less music-class.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have record players."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who only come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted nearly a whole floor to the records, has a blower audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and women of middle age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts of the latest Synthesizer- and sexually-packed pop instead of experimental jazz wears out of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strangely lonely, but naïve psychic trauma is hard to imagine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window-bumper rather than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't deserve much, therefore collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "it is easy to hear music from a computer or in any other way, but the beauty of records is..." "" "she drives away with a dearest sigh." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I seem to have to muzzle the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter decide to buy a crossover record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essentials plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, who has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov are correct, they, at least in record shops in Soho, have unaccounted for the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their thursday morning with security not with bumblebees through bursting shops of Berwick Street and the sheets by plates while they steer clear to the starring gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who raises nothing over the shoulders of middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods, cigarettes to energydrinks, sell, sell hair services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that have a risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the Court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people operating the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the tearing was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>

<seg id="13">The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimates on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle of the jungle has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number by now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers must adapt to the next generation speed measurer: in different federal states, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flashes are being tested, which should lead to a particularly effective overhaul.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement Trailer of the Vitronic from Wiesbaden can, for example, be used in accidents, where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or to rehabilitated bridges with temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary speed camera for adherence to speed limit.</seg>
<seg id="5">A permanent mobile setup can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery holds five days for uninterrupted measuring operations, the case data is transmitted encoded via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded across multiple lanes simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as drive-through restrictions after time, travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">The trailer is able to move with each car with trailer hitch in a state-of-the-art state.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-year-old Rugby came to an abrupt halt at the final hurdle in the final hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were struck with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji issued a master class in handling, side-stepping, back-up, line running and raw power to gain gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">Defeat was missed by the silver medal not too bad - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Brite will hang a gold medal tomorrow around his neck: Fijis's head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England in Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and left Gb's attacks out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if one would run into running buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau grasped in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB have hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A drastic Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to score a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Veremalua left a touch down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the replay and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou squeezed through further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still listening.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua went through after a brilliant Interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched a test for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favor of the South Sea Sullians, whose fans sang, swinging flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked out crushing in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on that day, Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain crowned South Africa in a scarce semi-finals from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the ks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a score among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tacking by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinary gold than in these games and that wants to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard drives that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach, Robin Williams, was present at the second Olympic stadium in a row without a tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British Sports who laid such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolute, after all her 39.ter unfired use, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the style of the triumphal arch.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the herd is a battalion of willing helpers, who make a difference to the incremental advances that make the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who did not know 30 months if he was diagnosed with cancer this day.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risked.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and that they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, he expands everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit of the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which stopped the interruption to a minimum if that was the right term at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go back better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve wrecking morning with something more than anything else to talk and thus tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "panning, which was a Captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said," "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. it might be a bit extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose any race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close, panning and glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very trapped in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called, "Keep in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to get carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to make something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">Today we didn't want a fireworks, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week at a wedding, their own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="7">"" "the work of the Veitenstein Group led" "" "Bavarian far as exemplary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this, Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the kennel team, stands for 28 years as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water association of the Veitenstein Group, located in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, transports approximately 150000 cubic meters of water per year and supplies 32 places and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member communities are the municipalities of Kirchheim, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairwoman, Breitbrunns Bürgerforeman Gertrud Bühl (FW) recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a waterkeeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Confederation in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water pipeline construction and maintenance work on office and organisational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends," "" "said the chairwoman." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new well (1994), purchase of land in the area of the new well (1998) and compensation for farmers, the restoration of the elevated tanks (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial reconstructions of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no downtime and I have always added new things because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In their Laudatio, she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose bandage and he has lived the water-purpose bandage as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group for the nitrate reduction in front of the Unterfranken Waterforum.</seg>
<seg id="20">For that he received a lot of praise and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert göller, on his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water man and he was a faithful boy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a highlight from his point of view he described the well-being and the restructuring of the kennel.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest challenge and the most difficult task, however, were the rupture of the tubular breakage at Kirchlouon on January 3.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">One can only maintain the supply of new brunn because one filled the high container of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - flashlight for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the sector from green electricity subsidies are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains at the release of the renewable energy revolution in the existing plants for so-called self-power production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>

<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levy of 20 percent applies.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also these are not raised in the steel industry.</seg>

<seg id="21">On the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel impact, on the other hand, economic prospects in China have risen.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is not clear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp also did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015.</seg>

<seg id="30">After a short upliftment in May, the produced quantity went back to each other for the second month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing elderly well</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has already accompanied her entire life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's study she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, they do something good for their health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">From several perspectives, singing is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German retirement league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and cultivate social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ursel Kipp has also made this experience in her choir: "to speak and organise, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of togetherness."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be strenuous in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs are not as fast as possible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Employment Service of Senior Citizens Organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia-sick people are sinking into long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">While singing, a special performance is required to the head, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">To concentrate on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people who live alone do so not only concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, writes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise something for a long time, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whoever wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz says.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the appropriate offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintance in a senior choir, one can simply join himself.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn right to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you have no access to the Internet, you can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the internet search.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to sing, you should join a choir, tell Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does good for the soul and has something liberating - that is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="6">The Russian swimmers Julija Jefimowa, who complained about the games after a doping-lock shortly before the games, was mercilessly flaccid and hatched at their start (100 m chest).</seg>
<seg id="7">It was a whimsical scene: with a set smile she was still in the hall and had provoked her appearance.</seg>
<seg id="8">When he found out that she won't get gold, the audience broke out into a jubilee.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there are numerous other sportsmen who, despite the doping past, go to the Olympics in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here is an overview:</seg>
<seg id="11">Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-relay / USA): the 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.</seg>
<seg id="12">He had been locked two times because of doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).</seg>
<seg id="13">Since its spell, the Olympic champion of 2004 and former world champion has been running even faster than before, he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is considered the greatest challenger of Usain Bolt.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-relay / Jamaika): the two-time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to abort a six-month lock in 2010 after it was proved by Oxycodon's pain.</seg>

<seg id="20">A means for penis enlargement would have been responsible, bettered Merritt.</seg>

<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical for the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist uprising movement or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage which is restricted to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It is rather assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid.</seg>
<seg id="23">The authorities would have kept secret advice on upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however, they had not been informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is not yet clear which group is hiding behind the attacks.</seg>

<seg id="8">As Head of Management Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board, a new calculation of fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period between October 2016 and September 2020, over- and / or undercoverings from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.</seg>

<seg id="11">As a result of the low distribution base, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water level in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the reclining calculation period in all three plants, not least because of their age renovation and repair costs have fallen to a considerable extent.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as Asian caricature criticized</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, Snapchat enables some 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein picture.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blunt, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million new selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All wrongdoing leads to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the past, Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in which they were accused that the app would promote black face foe or white skin as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week some users suggested a filter that gave them slit-eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called a racist cartoon by Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies showed a greater problem that the company has a diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have turned off the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was conceived as a tribute to anime characters and not as cartoon by Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime-comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely distributed over the photos that the filter was "hurting and bark, was unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face was pulled into the debilitating extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling wire.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And snapchats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in the race than their older opponents - might rather go out to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters produces an image that is insulting for a user, "it is much harder to keep such things unnoticed than it was before," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for the medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account, asking others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that they believe that racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the large part white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," "" "said the Chinese-American Zhu," "" "or they have people with other skin colours that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that largely unanswered Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, it rejected Snapchat to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman the company recently set up a personnel responsible, focusing on underrepresented population groups and internal integration efforts.</seg>

<seg id="2">Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions were allowed on site, an investigation committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican Members of the Army Committees, Intelligence Committees and Conscription Commites, reports of great discontent among Central Command intelligence agencies, who reported how superiors changed their assessments on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, typically taken from high-level Centcom commanders, regularly recorded a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what has happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "stated Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in Centcom reach the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows in detail ongoing problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government spikes under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts faced pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements in front of the Congress were much more positive than it meets the facts," "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom associate publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigations, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to life after it was played that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the CentCom reports are under way through the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the news service committee published their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015 CentCom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "" "announced the highest-level democrat in the Committee, a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "said the moral of analysts and" "" "disproportionately little room for different opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "but Mr. Ship and the democrats reported not to have found any hints at the intervention of the White House in CentCom analysts regarding a" "" "definite political opinion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's general inspector, who were admitted to Centcom analysts' complaints.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesman of the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment any reports of the Congress, while the investigations of the chief inspector were still under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have diverging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important themes of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, last year's accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the Secret Information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush opposed the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the revolt against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker states that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation since these temporary refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">CentCom damaliger Commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for its excessively positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff, which is handed down from the wrist to the triathlete to float to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbour in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Leathery or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympics and a swarm of women with dimples, could well be among these well-known names that were sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I'm modest enough to make arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it was so sparsely perceived that many of them, I had asked, did not know that it was a Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012, who managed it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend this year's Gold Medal from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline bed has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than that sounds for the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but a bound enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has a humorous potential - the cartoonical trembling of his never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means" "" "stepping stone" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, hitting and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to official Olympic Games, they are assessed according to execution, degree of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medalists hoping to go farther, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only chase the finish line or the starting wall, but also a further highlight in TV transmission: the world or the Olympiarekord.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented quest is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel as a bit tiring even when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she jumps off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes upwards, then downward, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, not a wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be in the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the angling and the objective of male athletes - as the male US gymnasts suggested recently - according to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley awaits its new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at shot exchange.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests erupted against the government and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organizations, the government's response was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed on umpteen unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about the protests, which are presumably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror attacks beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations continued to suppress repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents effectively put to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the deserts of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you oppress people and have no other options except protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoue Teshome, a teacher in central Ethiopian." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold on the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time tensions rise along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo liberation front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been enforced more or less in recent years, could protect and re-arm the turbulence.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode under the surface of Hinköchelns under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with social media because cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide wherever they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians believed that they were so close to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons of time, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy as they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to coordinate under a umbrella," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account for about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, secret services, commerce and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, until his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012, was 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well-versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively intransparent reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he enjoys not the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had experienced such a revolt was in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, which, according to the analysts, were apparently distracted by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of riots went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal malpractice of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it adopts a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an amusing city, managed by Tigray and hatred towards the Tigray becomes more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for scheduled flights over the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "this," "" "said Mr Abdi," "" "is a very thin emigration." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his claim Obama had founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dissipate the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday, fearing that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raises new questions about the communication skills of the Republicans's presidential candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and intelligently with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings together his fellow campaigners who endeavour to take protection during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position to explain the statements he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump remarked with reference to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump told he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day, on which Mr. Trump told in a series of interviews, he said the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr Obama wants to destroy IS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism smasselt on Mr. Trump, while he tried to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling transfer values to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew a lot of criticism when he said the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, "Of course I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic borders in politics and then to recruit as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it is one of his ways to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then" "" "clarify" "" "depending on how the reaction falls." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has assumed an even more corrosive tone, since its polls have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump in general tries not to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his sense of humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he emphasises the attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal fellow combatants into the uncomfortable situation to face him regardless of how provocative his statements might be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocates, was struggling to defend candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr Giuliani, so he asked about the correctness of Mr. Trumps's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama IS an almost unknown, small organization, he called them ambushers, completely wrong, and that's why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the Mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to spread to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign events held in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of going around on any of his words and being biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats ridiculed Mr. Trumps as a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland hair usually comes to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an investigation, this shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland hair is only 150 years old.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland-shark swims at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1,220 meters far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle dominated by loneliness seems to be a godfather for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" "" "Science" "" "at least from a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "insanity," "" "Alexander Scheuerlein at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock commented on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolutionary biologist probably thought that Greenland will be stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's hay is difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">They measured their slow motion when they made six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, prey make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may chase sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and seek carcasses that torkel from higher water-layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland-hay, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 centimeter in size.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably a lot of carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempt to impede large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">The lentier, on the other hand, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons in the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters. in 2012, it was likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, all major Greenland-havoys had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens nucleus, which is generated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493-centimeter-long Grönland shark, while the record Hai should be even 392 years old with 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-hai-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland's hair with the multiplication becomes apparent at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">The fact that such methane emes live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 years old Greenland whale, in whose bacon on the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon point, was captured before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there is often also running on a flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal buys heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should, on the other hand, invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow occupied the anchorage that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself to Eigen. the Jumping and made the legend proud when he stormed home to conceal a victory from the favorites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after seeing only a modest sixth place in March at the railway world championships in London despite the withdrawal of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired produced a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindu, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner competed in the qualification round an Olympic chord, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap, Hindi was almost back, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, in which Hindes went in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindu, when they climbed onto the pedestal.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic chord in the final round and defeated the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 at the site Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no appeal by England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hindu said," "" "It feels like the whole GB flags on the grandstand like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team over the past three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the cycle of bikes.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeats Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy who was also born on 23 March (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same as Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part next in the sprint that starts today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win on your own.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two other gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They reached the target in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record that won gold in London in 2012 was 3: 51.659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had argued yesterday with officials before the qualification when functionaries were calling him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding Women's Competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Despite, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a medal of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional depiction of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">They played in the background, so the resignation of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and bulbbing and retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation GBs that has reached its peak at the perfect moment could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy set for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be jeopardized during a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects as the melt consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa joined the point Henry melt, which last year led to a closure of the fishing industry.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Alcoa melt in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melt with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, indicated that three further owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp are holding smaller shares.</seg>

<seg id="2">San Antonio Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">San Antonio, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the view brought me to tears," "" "wrote Antonio." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or just Keeping Up with the Kardashians like?), weird reality video showing the whole Kardashian Jenner family (except the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn) as they forget the cover of their sister and that ended with a classic turn: they all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the cliché deed of almost every birthday party of a children's show (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You thought we had forgotten you?" with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of Kardhians has begun with certainty.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendal's big sister Kim likes her beating the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that rather resembles a picture tape than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According Fashionista were 615 pages of advertising from the 832 pages of the ramzer).</seg>
<seg id="11">The disclosure of its cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still leak before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">Over the past few years, there were clearly more "celebrities, mowers" than "models that are celebrities" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls below the earlier category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners don't like success to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV history, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always something exciting.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called her "the misty pieces of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings cod up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But walking around on the mom seems to pass at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">San Antonio Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your priming of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all their sisters will sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her free time she is seen in Reality TV. probably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.</seg>

<seg id="3">The incident is described in an indictment, which was filed on Wednesday in the Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "Bordini agreed to have been waiting for months that the matter would be regulated internally before he realized that" "" "that would not happen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "the campaign leader, Earl Philip," "" "drew a gun, put his right hand on the deduction, and battered the barrel in Vincenzo's knee," "" "gave Bordini in his accusation." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">After complaining with the local and regional campaign management, Bordini stated that at least four more people had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "weapons must not be fired to cause damage," "" "he added." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">The prosecution only comes two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - firearm owners and arms buddies - should take action if his Rivalin Hillary Clinton is elected and judge should appoint judges.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trumps campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words from the context and that he would not violate violence.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses for the governing parties of the SPD and CDU are apparent.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the" "" "Bild" "" "newspaper (Friday)." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition in the North could not rule further, this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to face the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern the SPD fell from 35.6 percent to 24 percent five years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party was only marginally ahead of the CDU, which again could come back to 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would come to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite light losses, the Greens returned to Schwerin Landtag despite slight losses (previously 8.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="11">NPD and FDP were not represented in the Landtag with 3 per cent each.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the survey, the election of the SPD in Berlin would only be 23 percent (2011 election: 28.3 per cent).</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in slow motion: the Nokia Communicator was launched 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was rather palpitous.</seg>
<seg id="7">Initially, the built-in memory was eight megabytes, which would suffice for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "the" "" "Nokia 9000 communicator" "" "arrived exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, into the stores - and it was the first smartphone." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros, lovers can buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as an "office in the west pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone was able to receive a lot for those standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was to be reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, albeit slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, about 1400 Euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could foresee in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The mobile phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold and wound up to Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, vendors are able to control the market every much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Being online anytime and anywhere, this is everyday life for a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="26">There were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="27">About 1.4 billion units sold, Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million units.</seg>
<seg id="28">The worldwide turnover of the devices is around 400 billion euros.</seg>

<seg id="33">Apple's victory procession began, even today, the iPhone is the most important product of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who ruled the market, had the lookout.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity all over the country not only in our local communities and throughout London.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me this was the biggest attraction of Heathrows, just as in 2012 in London, when we had a great effort to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we will have already 10,000 new apprentices, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of Heathrows is too big.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blamass ourselves on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters had wronged 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every asked question.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for single an infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, to create £211 billion in hybrid growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequented walkways in the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third run, which is supported by £16 billion in private investments.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="3">On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockages on its desktop site, Adblock Plus released a blog post, in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to further block advertising on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook shared that its desktop page would change coding for its advertisements in order to make it difficult to detect the detection on which part of the site is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-Her-battle between the offensive open source community and the hangers has already been underway since the invention of ad blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying trends have become the industry.</seg>

<seg id="3">The police call witnesses after a woman was driven off on a motorway in the early morning hours on Thursday at a presumed suicide of several vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman laid down in the Dark "in an act of despair" on the street and were hit by several cars, the police told in Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that a Swiss in the age of 49, who was driven by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.</seg>
<seg id="7">She still died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several drivers have already been heard, but some have not yet been identified, the police told them and every witness of the incident to report.</seg>
<seg id="9">An investigation process was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared the Le Tribune de Geneve.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "this is something the prosecutor has to decide," "" "said Hofstetter." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases over the last five years show that the drivers are not held accountable.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway as it was said in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year a police officer was acquitted after having gone over and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and has become unconscious in the street, condemned the court.</seg>
<seg id="17">The court found that the police -- who had responded to an emergency call -- drove on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely unusual and unforeseeable situation," said the judge.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies from NASA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus could have shown similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and still rotated slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of the Venus is exposed to its day-side of the sun for almost two months," "" "said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a story of Venus that resembles evolution previously thought by planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was presumably inhabitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burnt away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide left behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Weldreameskop has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the Plejades cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the constellations rotate to different rates as well as in which context the rotational periods are with planet origin.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through comparing our results with other constellations, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Centre in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>

<seg id="6">Many stars in this cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympics 2016: chen Xinyi, Silvia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping attacks.</seg>
<seg id="4">A learned athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping incidents in Rio de Janeiro have become known.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter-obstacle-runner Silvia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively in Brazil and ruled out - immediately before the start of the already critical athletics competitions this news arrives at the time.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has been proven last Sunday which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International sports court CAS confirmed the expulsion of the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old had finished fourth in the finals over 100 m of butterflies, only about 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday Chen would have had a 50 m free style in the runs.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B-trial and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the issue" "" "very serious and demands Chen's full co-operation in the investigations," "" "said Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news spread about the positive rehearsal at Danekova, the 33-year-old went to the offensive himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "said the Bulgarian TV channel BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "it was innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "said the athlete." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the banned substance is expected to act as a means of blood doping.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample was also expected to be positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately announced his criticism with criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," "" "he said," "" "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For instance, all weight lifters from the chronically doping nation may not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski," known as the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, was tested positive for three days earlier than his brother Tomasz on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, but both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of athletes, especially the case of Danekova is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF World Association banned the launch of the entire Russian squad, except for systematic doping, and the Läufernation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the swimming sport, the previous offences in China also took care of violent clashes between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harsh.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium above 200 m free style, I want to pass over," "" "said Lacourt in the French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun also focused on a confrontation with Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping fraud," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">In 2014, Sun had a positive effect on the stimulant Trimetazidin in the Chinese Championship, but had to lose only a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: as perfide, hackers blackmail their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Developers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Malwarebytes below 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the last twelve months were at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the charges required by the perpetrators to reuse the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize in attacks on corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to replace ransom is considerably higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a startling fast evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "World" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, private users were the goal, but the change to company attacking took place in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals permanently.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final code to the files, the victim must transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryptogram Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users use the personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls if a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt their business operations, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany several hospitals were already victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only support the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of downtime in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build up a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure safety researchers have examined the user interfaces and contact with blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, free accessible support websites or deciphering for free sample files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are redeemed after payment of a few hundred euros, companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively high-risk profits from ransomware extortion, hackers are becoming ever more professional and share the work, says Security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by purchasing malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is a fitting tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers then seek further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the boards underground, buys the set from a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals employ spammers with the spread," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the company's IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey rely on the ability to repel ransomware by file-back-ups and scanning software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators are threatened instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "declares Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the potential for damage is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blockaded heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda plans to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a mini van.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear, it does not work in any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit top is a little off.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a seat and offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The luggage compartment can be loaded well, but the load height is 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide-speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he should do his work slightly quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another motorisation: a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort." ""</seg>

<seg id="18">"" "the equipment does not leave any wishes unfulfilled in the tested top variant" "" "Executive" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The safety systems include the city emergency brake assist (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the collision warning sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "" "when maneuvering." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote-light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller responds to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed when required.</seg>
<seg id="23">But full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI jack are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat awkward to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic flow on the motorway feeder</seg>
<seg id="2">It stalls regularly on the roadside - here a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this should change: the legal deflection should be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is a good news for all car drivers who are driving in traffic on the ambient street every night, when they drive over the motorway to Zubringer (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">On the next Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August), road construction will be extended by 700 metres between the Hammer Road and the Weseler Street downhill.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then turn right from the hammer road to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The big advantage: the traffic is getting up early, which improves the overall course of time on the busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the District Council of Münster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The road narrowing on the feeder is annoying the drivers between 17 and 19 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays, the way back to the bridge over the Alberslova way and sometimes also extends beyond that.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reason for this is the needle-eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Weseler Street.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here, traffic is only guided by lane over the motorway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second track had to be built back over a quarter of a century ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reason: static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the required load capacity, in order to absorb the heavy duty traffic in two lanes.</seg>
<seg id="15">The competent regional operation cannot say how long this bottleneck and the connected workday traffic jam will continue.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, it has to be reckoned with years: because the bridge has an official remaining term of use by 2034.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one rolls around for hours, at night, one is awake for hours, in the morning it is far ahead of the alarm-ringing no longer to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but restful.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of the adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems manifest or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons underlying them, stresses Hans-Günter Titsch, a member of the board of the German Society for Sleeping and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, the insomnia, therefore an intrance and sleep disturbance, is what one understands.</seg>
<seg id="8">When sleeping, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German House Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this can be organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medication.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, sleep disturbance is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is frequent in a depression," "" "says Naoko." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, if you have a disk failure, it can be bad, wake up every two or three hours and begin to ponder on everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go with sleep disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week, should go to the doctor, tell a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look quite different: you are beaten, tired, unrested, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like gastric or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleeping disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, low-settled medical professionals hardly exist, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary dormitory of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, one should first contact the family doctor in case of sleeping problems, advises Dr.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise, for example, snoring with respiratory sufferers, in case of abnormal tiredness, in case of sleep-converters, or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disturbance, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "just do not make a midday sleep," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the disguise, one goes to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes of the body, one carries a nose pair, a chest strap and a sensor at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera stands on the ceiling of the sleeping-ends.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can anybody get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">It counts: regular sleep and stopping times, not to sleep long in bed, don't sleep on the day, do not watch TV to fall asleep, avoid drinking alcohol and not watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is quite and not at all conducive.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, Civilians of the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several bags and piles of luggage as a gang.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30 p.m., civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf Airport detected a gang that was known to the police officers from past theft.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since the middle of July this year, the two women and two men had committed several offences.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Specialists of the Criminal Commissariat of Criminal Law 34 can prove four acts specifically for the crimes committed by criminal offences in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">In total, they had caught a total of more than 15,000 Euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few Lindenbäumchen, in between are still a rest cobblestones: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not appear in the first sight, but the police force them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one gets past playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly" "" "was sprayed on the façade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite of a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already being built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy district" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be illustrated in recent weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the inhabitants have rental contracts, but in the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin internal senator Henkel has advocated for a hard action by the police against the project, the area referred to as "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the cadavers, had been cleared with 300 police officers, patrol the police for three weeks, according to official statements, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, construction workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown house owners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers marched under the cheering of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the street works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain in front of Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left Violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children here, are especially annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, which mainly wished police protection from the vandaliatory left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police make up between the house occupiers and their neighbours, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class neighborhood, which today, compared to the rest of the city, has a low average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße in the vicinity of the Riga Zoo.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been swept under a large police array in a real street battle, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and polls from all over the world over the past few years: with them, residents from GDR times and former housemakers are now sharing their neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them on windowed slices or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year so often along with the words" "" "left-autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to look at this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal offences such as bodily injury follow statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the criminal offences constitute allegations that tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a house for 17 years next to the disputed 94, there can be no talk about uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is weighty: people in the 94 are their neighbors, who have not been that.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, her street is not a criminal record, on the contrary: "here you can help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously moved to the Rigaer Straße - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important to her that the residents get back their streets: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all of a sudden demanded the interpretation sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by faceless newbuildings in former building gaps that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people here are more people who are not so well searched" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I can absolutely not make violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what to do if someone never listens to it?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding of concentric ones, who annoy themselves about color bombs: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who draw near should be aware - just like someone who walks in a pub area, can complain about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented with first names have asked not to be named with their proper name</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the Commissioner for Refugees for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working groups, refugees, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is here, the vanishing woolen milk-sau, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus some - less mocking but rather focused on the multitude of tasks desired - meant when administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an affluent woolen milk-sau.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "but administrative work is not their central area," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>

<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine Client that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are great and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon stand in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations have to be borne by the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the administrative office to the commune and the job centre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it is not possible to rely on private dwellings, such as Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common flats have to be intimidating as it is called so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">New containers will soon be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and employment opportunities for refugees and migrants who need to be greased or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help master craftsmen, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers like sport, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">Thus also administration and volunteers are also jumping here.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever will eventually develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, don't work and be useless, will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are problems also, "says customer honestly," people with whom nothing works. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalisation after the recent incidents, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine customer says quite clearly," "" "what some may call naive." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the subject of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the attacks would bring them up completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with that," "" "says Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary officials will have to look for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always been in the background that soon a new strike of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly does not shy away from politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">It is actually unfair to place them on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we have not yet arrived, where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urgbacher is already busy to integrate the existing people properly.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
