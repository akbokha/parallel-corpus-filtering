Obama welcomes Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and T@@ eher@@ an dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution should also be addressed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is critici@@ zing Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and repro@@ aches Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal between the two has deterior@@ ated further with the deal signed by Obama for the Iranian nuclear program .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech before the US Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected him with reference to the election im@@ min@@ ent in Israel .
in an emergency call Professor , his girlfriend shot to have shot
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is still alive and probably excited and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ p@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to und@@ o it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Univers@@ it√§ts @-@ Staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 hrs .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal emergency call at some point afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took his life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they enjoyed their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time , there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not represent a guarantee for an automatic way to employment as an assistant professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs track later , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed herself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , told Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ ane Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he believed he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he completed his doctorate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and she was 20 when they met together with friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar play .
he was then the flock of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls were mol@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and P@@ enti@@ ss were obviously together for a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail both appeared on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for different companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poor@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5 September last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmony in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of joke .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people participated in the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght memorial service .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the memorial , while the university choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
classes will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb had the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that Lamb had called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer labor force for Christmas time
toys R Us say that there won &apos;t be so many Christmas seasonal workers as last year , but the toy and baby product dealer says that he will give the current staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it plans to employ 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 4@@ 5.000 staff were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees will rise from October to December .
while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business moves closer and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip shops with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox sc@@ outs on his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the ro@@ y@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty next to me , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it makes sense to me that I am a simul@@ ated y@@ awn and an ar@@ mes@@ de length of it to be with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel movie ever made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected movie the@@ aters in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon states that his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the conflict lasting almost five years , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the periph@@ ery of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tackl@@ ing the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 surveys that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others did it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans are trying to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys , it has not yet worked .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously question what it means for the chances of nom@@ in@@ ating the real estate Mog@@ ul .
of course it is too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won only a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ um@@ ps staying power and start to drop their dollars to overthrow it .
here are some current survey figures indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular values have rot@@ ated by 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey by the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul positively .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans said they were either &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 would say they would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing about enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio at only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the candidate of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans don &apos;t see Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters ten@@ ding to the re@@ public@@ ans believe that the real estate Mog@@ ul has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is seen in the nation &apos;s first national election state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent believe that he does not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they expose their hats , republi@@ can voters keep Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle , four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it is evident that a large number of GO@@ P voters are watching Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ support is spread across more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump wins majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally in front of Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump are saying that they have firmly entr@@ en@@ ched their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say that never change your mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump has been calling immig@@ rant from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; two months ago , the immigration and fishing point in public discourse has been in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump crucial His@@ pan@@ o Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it will appear to be Donald Tr@@ ump .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son spend around half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all because of their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Monday survey of ABC / Post , they prefer to have a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in the Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell bent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
the most expensive residential complex is located here in the Hob@@ lin@@ en@@ weg - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , one square meter of a roof @-@ roof house costs ‚Ç¨ 7@@ 3,@@ 300 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which specific locations one square meter costs the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top places , however , the price of pe@@ an@@ uts occurs .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; V√∂lk@@ el has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros - per square meter , well marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is , as an exception , not at the top .
Champions League : Bavarian dream start thanks to M√ºller and G√∂tz@@ e
two @-@ brother scor@@ er in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ star Thomas M√ºller has just a run .
a happy hit by Thomas M√ºller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at the Olympics of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
a supreme pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League of the season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas M√ºller and Mario G√∂tz@@ e have given the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of Train@@ ers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to M√ºll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol hits ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth launch in series will be the first step towards the final on 28th May 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run .
M√ºller received a boun@@ tiful help from the Olympic champion Go@@ wart Roberto , who had a well thought @-@ out shot of the World Champion at his 28th hit in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s leadership .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based audience kept the word .
they showed a concentrated and committed imagination without gl@@ it@@ tering .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his youngest home games in the top class , among them known as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ √©@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was also proud ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European Cup du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ a@@ geous in their offensive efforts , but often too imagin@@ ative .
the attacks have often been initiated by the shift of the game on the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , which was rarely interrupted by O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i from the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
M√ºller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k struck from the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ que .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half .
first , when the Olympic team struck the ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved up their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to make needle stit@@ ches .
but at Tor@@ h√º@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er he was reli@@ eved .
so about when he defl@@ ected a shot of ide@@ ye about the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who did it well .
Mario G√∂tz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the fa@@ der , initially sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final session , said Sports Director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to make something different is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an for the slaugh@@ tered Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
i@@ dol was late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , M√ºller made one on it .
before the game it had come to Kra@@ v@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of murdered Bayern fans in their blo@@ c apparently provoked the supporters of host Pir@@ re@@ aus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and proc@@ eeded with pun@@ ches against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bavarian fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , har@@ ms not only the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : at ren@@ unciation the risk sin@@ ks quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is based on the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees at the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers were at risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 times .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth decay are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , the authors stress .
the link between smoking and loss of teeth therefore results in more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years before the endanger@@ ment falls back to the level of qu@@ itting smoking , the first author Thomas Dietrich explained from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , Head of study H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and blood vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health up to high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness has been affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study rein@@ forces the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet the remains of the L@@ ate Anti@@ quity on Cologne banks of the Rhine
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the second time .
archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have dug up skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historic buildings close to the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard , said Museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are looking for so @-@ called land monuments .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always called as a department of archaeological excav@@ ation .
in the third construction section of the Rhin@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now been informed .
from text documents it was already known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman captured by freight train
after a young woman is caught up at the station in Gei@@ id@@ s@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police asks the people for help .
on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 p.m. the woman came from the train station building and reached the track at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction of M√∂n@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
according to the Federal Police , she carried out he@@ avi@@ est injuries by collecting the train .
it was treated on site and carried out by rescue personnel to a hospital .
on the basis of the noc@@ tur@@ nal cross @-@ border crossing of the young woman there are no findings to the investigating authorities .
the incident was possibly observed by witnesses or residents heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
there are residents or p@@ asser@@ s by Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , brick bakery , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Stra√üe ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .
information about the cause of the accident can be given at around the clock and free hot@@ line of the Federal Police under phone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station can be given .
EU Commission launches new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
in order to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TT@@ IP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the responsible EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ str√∂m at the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swedish intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced its support .
TT@@ IP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely demonstrate that the EU states and the U.S. jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time a second instance is planned .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
so far , the parties involved have agreed among themselves on refer@@ ees , a possibility of obj@@ ection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussions over the past few months it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Malm@@ str√∂m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she plans to work towards an international investment court .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) especially demanded by major corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , through which companies can engage in damages to tax@@ pay@@ ers , le@@ verage national legislation or en@@ force a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act described the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate .
it has been critic@@ ised above all that it should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as a big step forward .
the Commission took key points into account in the reform that the Federal Minister of Economics Sig@@ mar Gabriel had worked with other EU trade ministers in spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ str√∂m &apos;s plans .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against restric@@ ting the economic activity of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the free trade agreement TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sat on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the tim@@ id @-@ looking fol@@ ks@@ ler recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells the story on the basis of different places he always draws on the map , what his meticul@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs tell .
where they have ar@@ isen and what it looks like in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderfully creative person .
with the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , &quot; cle@@ ver@@ ly composed songs , which are harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , can always drift into the great opul@@ ent .
it is rum@@ oured that Mich@@ igan would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states of the US should be con@@ stru@@ ed as a result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and positively breaks down certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live is enough for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician living in New York returns to the show .
in 2005 , &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) is a nationwide masterpiece .
excessive ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in the list of records of influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively of electronic sub@@ stitutes .
this sixth full studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and rever@@ ber@@ ations .
since the smaller clubs have risen , the stage shows here become a colourful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage d√©@@ cor .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring as part of a five member band through Germany .
in the dark @-@ kept Hamburg More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are now banned in their chairs , the considerably more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk .
without judging the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
you hear from the audience : the talk is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can basically throw away the &quot; record . &quot;
only after an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens thank@@ ed mo@@ dest@@ ly , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally bows down under thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the PM
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut has been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited in the Prime Minister &apos;s final round .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will be making his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Q &amp; D round , and for the first time he will deal with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to question the first of his six pres@@ et questions shortly after mid@@ day , where his performance is likely to be examined by the media and Labour MPs close by .
he called for &quot; less theater and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary sc@@ rut@@ iny of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C convention on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ okes criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several news stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokes@@ man said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in Battle of Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they were referring to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported it as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t states that political differences are also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour has proposed changes to remove the whole idea of limiting overall .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow employment and retirement minister said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans to lower the limitation of ¬£ 26.@@ 000 to ¬£ 23.@@ 000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader who has been standing over the Dis@@ patch Box during the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader who has promised another policy approach says that he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crowd @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ l@@ ington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s questions are con@@ front and that it is subject to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; skill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and stri@@ pping with hooks and has instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister is represented by him , if he does not take part - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also initiated the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy show theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s frei@@ ghter . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Parliament and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics argued they had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms .

pounds increase due to accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the Po@@ und rose ab@@ rup@@ tly after data showing an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid target SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , the result without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and most advanced assessments at the time of an increase in interest since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to ‚Ç¨ 1.@@ 37@@ 30 until 0.@@ 84 % .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the take @-@ over of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
share of Gl@@ en@@ core rose by 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion dollars through a stock sale as part of his strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his app@@ rais@@ al for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sport management company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages will end@@ anger expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are less additional jobs .

the fans don &apos;t .
also Bie@@ ber herself did not .
this has already taken care of anyway .
for the advertisement in the advertising pause of the super market , he cas@@ hed up three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ple company put many , many dollars on the Bie@@ ber account .
and with every doll that looks like he goes and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber also collects .

he is said to have caught more than 100 million .
some say that the hyp@@ e is too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; others stress that Bie@@ ber is finally just in the US and Great Britain with his new single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on No@@ .1 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ GI@@ DA poster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brings the Leban@@ ese to a potato di@@ mm@@ ing idea &quot; &quot; &quot;
potato or D@@ √∂ner ?
it is both - in the Pot@@ ato d@@ √∂ner , which the Ol@@ denburg I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y has developed .
inspired by the slogan &quot; Pot@@ ter instead of D@@ √∂ner &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ √∂ner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had accidentally seen on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , in his shop , a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is stock@@ ed with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is multic@@ ultural to the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has already resulted in the Leban@@ ese being registered at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
however , Al@@ ha@@ y doesn &apos;t want to tell us how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
only so much : &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; he finds .

met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches Land Strategy Camp@@ aig@@ n to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice makers S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and store owners who sell che@@ ated tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 if the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment passes through its annual investors strategy day .
there is a lot at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia .
but analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will take away from all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million revenue per year and met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and the amounts on Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s high fixed cost base could cost Met@@ cash approximately $ 13 million in earnings before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s increases sales in food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ cash contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , the market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenue from Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s &apos;s food and food trade , which has about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operating debt reduction for simultaneous printing on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to match sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by fast growing fresh food and providing a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s &apos;s major managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging rehabilitation programmes will grow to El@@ an and hopes that in 2017 , the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ gio and , according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly , deserves praise for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight with the not@@ orious contest of Kyr@@ gy@@ gio with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated by the refer@@ ee twice , with Har@@ rison shou@@ ting : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ back , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how to beat a tennis ra@@ cket after a cr@@ amp bl@@ ended a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the sing@@ zel behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m fairly sure about is the fact that , according to my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was a bit drag@@ ged into the fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a fight in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke a bat of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well into the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he has never had a problem with the other players , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take account of the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term fixed component . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ back &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Nick quickly made the ascent to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray made aware of . he made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I think it is appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , with@@ holds refugees
Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to go illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , when hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in an em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indignation .
the people who fled violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian army police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary were sent back while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ blo@@ c at a disputed meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a prompt action from Brussels or from its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency station@@ ed on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to manage the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after it ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were employed at the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point in the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the upcoming economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that stands strong in contradiction to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) tall fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia for a crime . these laws also impose higher sentences for convic@@ ted human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military expected next week , but Associated Press repor@@ ters have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days on the border .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences under the new laws .
authorities are trying to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and press a crowd to go there .
about 20 succeeded to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national pol@@ l
the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to maintain a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her over the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ election ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders stands second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is a candidate for the Office of the Pres@@ idency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters in the pres@@ election .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidate they will support .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more resistant than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored some profits .
Clinton has a big edge in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support for men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is back only with 5 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ tons &apos;s advantage with Democratic voters less than 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , however , still has a major advantage in the older voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead among the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a five @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the pre @-@ election democratic voters say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some reservations and further 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are excited above all by her .
the views are more strongly mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - just one quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton enthusias@@ tically , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s support is also mentioned by Clinton &apos;s supporters ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with the problems and the voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the vice @-@ president raises potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked by the prim@@ aries who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
more than half of Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den would be far from S@@ anders their second choice .
if Bi@@ den decides not to channel the Democrats for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton increases ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chosen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call for questions about elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like last month , not a single Democratic candidate , or a potential candidate for these voters , stands out as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics in voters of the pre @-@ election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den to be honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den cuts the three candidates best from hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him .
democratic voters in the pre @-@ election generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office as Foreign Minister continue to be asked , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall .
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion has still deterior@@ ated .
it is mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy of the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 percent of those entitled to vote do not consider it to be an honest and trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote consider Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good grades in leadership .
of the six candidates we tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority sees S@@ anders as being honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump at the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times
half of the voters &apos; support in the new pol@@ l has now dropped to the two candidates , and others are losing dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell down at the lowest , with 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are 6 % in third place .
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son climb@@ s in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support from the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post clearly showed Tr@@ ump before Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump took some side @-@ backs for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers , in order to find even more warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people are no longer in the sea : the maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with .
by contrast , swimming temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood loaded with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
almost two years after a student died during a bul@@ ky ritual of a student association in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder accus@@ ations are filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which contributed to his death , told the police .
officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound ruck@@ sack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while he was trying to reach a goal across a frozen field .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide implements and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ ti@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families have been destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ anes of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer representing the D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe issued an indictment for murder of the third rank for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of bul@@ ky attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that has been sanc@@ tioned - officially or un@@ officially - we will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local community .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increase in income comes , and the house is falling into wa@@ vering , yields on bonds will rise and the economy will slide into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on the procedure .
a recession came in just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
hence , representatives of the US Central Bank have strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise interest rates , but rather on the period needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement might be exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first raise of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no impact .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some sectors of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , anticip@@ ation of interest rates can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency to pay divi@@ den@@ ds 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the del@@ aying in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after the F@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in more detail , the market in the past 35 years is usually in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to higher interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , published by Bob D@@ oll , chief plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return on investment begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could speed up a recession .
it is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases had only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect the Atlanta F@@ ed to expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê
market participants have made an interest rate increase for the F@@ ed all year , and all eyes focused on the Federal Open Market Committee &apos;s meeting this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading only has a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all the increase cycles from 1950 to now have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers very quickly put into the shadows after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
when bor@@ rowing , the yields seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the raising cycle , the leaders of the bond dropped immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bond issues to move closer and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
it is interesting , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some evidence that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending has expanded and volati@@ lity continues - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the United States will benefit from this , when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are getting worse since an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and also financing their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equi@@ ties tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet exceeded the average of 5 percentage points on average after each of the earnings increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high @-@ capital returns as well as low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their lower quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a major problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most , Gold@@ man said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside the mere stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
savers could see profits by higher returns , even if experts from different opinions are how fast it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s Conserv@@ ative Member critici@@ zed the transmitter for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; du@@ mm@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also cited the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament co @-@ worker Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins picked up the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading Euro MP and raises new pressure on the broad@@ ca@@ ster to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the public broadcasting station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also cited the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously named examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC Director Director rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial opponents when it comes to live music and inform@@ ing the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey ar@@ gues that harder work must be made to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the Sel@@ ection of Culture , Media and Sport came under fire to tread the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins picked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of ¬£ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; produced in a special BBC fashion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if the next time it star@@ ed a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to issue money for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest income since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down the issues
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say that there are now signs that the online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been evolving over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is sw@@ inging , and we may experience that growth decreases .
the Black @-@ Friday @-@ Phen@@ om@@ enon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers with@@ hold their purchases prior to this event , which is held last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers attracted their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites rus@@ hed down .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that out of ¬£ 5 spending a little more than ¬£ 1 was spent online .
in some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now carried out via web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of man bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in fashion stores in the inner cities .
Muslims bury the killed in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funeral par@@ l@@ els in Mec@@ ca through the streets .
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group on load
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s Gro√ü@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
mour@@ ners filled , dressed largely in white , the route to pay their respect when the first of the dead comp@@ eted for their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ Renaissance cemetery .
the proc@@ ession of the mour@@ ning proc@@ eeded at the Holy Place , where only a few days previously a building crane was rus@@ hing through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed@@ side .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi King over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured a sanc@@ tion .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 people who were killed when a crane pl@@ ung@@ ed through the Great Central Bro@@ ch@@ ee of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane collap@@ sed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already agreed that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said the Bin Laden Group would not have let the crane arm be stopped when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad is prohibited .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man suffered to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which fell into an inner courtyard of the Gro√ü@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which takes place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group for not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s Gro√ü@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to the Saudi Arabian ruling family for decades and has taken over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &apos;s .
the wre@@ ck of the crane arrived in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy wing .
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million Ri@@ al ( ¬£ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount to permanent wounded .
other injuries receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss is saying that the time of cheap Eastern European cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople is over
Brit@@ ons increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen
this results in 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix @-@ shops that aim at professional tra@@ des@@ people .
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets throughout the country .
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its laid down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified eastern European arti@@ sans who carry out work in their homes .
if you can deal sk@@ ill@@ fully with a hammer or brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
the British are increasingly employing professional tra@@ des@@ people to perform DIY jobs in their homes , such as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ √©@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new CEO of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now out@@ dated .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which turn to craftsmen and close 60 points of sale of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are made by women .
at the moment the men prevail .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is still a majority of men in our stores . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to shift this to a balance more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the forefront of a UK in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Ms Lau@@ ry : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
due to the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ president A@@ ich / D@@ ob were responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and public procurement on Wednesday at the regional court of K@@ lagen@@ furt .
the accused were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of mis@@ use .
he was acqu@@ itted legally in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ sed in preliminary examination that the def@@ end@@ ants used funds from association accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , via which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials are also accused of financial failures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was eliminated by the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ √∂ff@@ en@@ sen@@ at , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that there was not an asset in the association at any time .
the sports officials only had compens@@ ations for expense and the sports club for whom they had spent a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money out of debt - the Pas@@ si@@ va was bet@@ ting approximately 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we were facing the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the def@@ end@@ ants told a large @-@ scale financial officer in the profession of bread . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance under@@ tak@@ ings as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in advance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , it is not allowed to pay any debts .
furthermore , with the corresponding financial success , the withdrawal of the expense allowance has been retro@@ actively decided until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely in 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
therefore also l@@ ump @-@ sum and not detail @-@ entries appeared , the former observer explained the processes .
the two accused managed to split accounts and spar@@ books together , said the second def@@ end@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed to the association in detail , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for financial sponsor@@ ship , important be only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
that had been set@@ backs , the def@@ end@@ ants asser@@ ted .
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; the judge wanted to know .
the respon@@ dent did not know a reply for a long time .
then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the society .
if something happened to him , nobody would have known any of that money , the prosec@@ utor asked the room .
the def@@ end@@ ant was informed , justified the function@@ ary .
this transfer was formulated as a &quot; claim repar@@ ation . &quot;
why compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
wher@@ eu@@ pon the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never suffered any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never had a cent salary , he merely charged mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
at di@@ ets he was charged 1.000 Euro per month , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
precise documents for the early years did not show the def@@ end@@ ants .
these were no longer stored after an audit in which everything was considered correct , they declared .
mil@@ eage was also covered by the second def@@ end@@ ant .
he explained in his statement that all the fixes had to be made in cash . in addition , he explained in his statement that he had to go to the bank from his place of residence for the Bank to Blei@@ burg .
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard presents another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the personnel cuts that have been running for three years , the Compu@@ te ese will reduce further jobs when it comes to spl@@ itting up the company .
there is no end to the job cuts at the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to cut down from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers division .
this will save costs of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , distributed the company on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter .
the 50@@ 5,000 jobs that have been running for three years has not yet been completed .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard share declined by 2.3 percent .
the company that has grown up with printers from the California Pal@@ o Alto currently spl@@ its up : this is how the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new company - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business units shall be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services put the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the revenues thus declined in 15 of 16 quarters .
HP answers the changes in the industry with a split and massive job cuts .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company headed by Me@@ g Whit@@ man has recently re@@ acted that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and buying more and more stores online .
Whit@@ mans restructuring plans envis@@ age a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
the direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would , however , largely reject rejection : 54 per cent opposed it , 35 percent expressed their consent .
the fact that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a co @-@ operation with Syrian leader Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad declined 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be for that .
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th Frankfurt Motor Show
the focus of the exhibition will be on the 27th of September connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two days of press conference , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility connects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the general public can visit the IAA from Saturday .

R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion of Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have deployed guards against several hundred abandoned refugees at the Serbian border near R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ √§n@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ thro@@ wers .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ √°@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he told by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind them a police line was formed , and behind the polic@@ emen a water designer stood ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officers initially un@@ interrupted pepper spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now res@@ ig@@ ned somewhat .
a pregnant and obviously injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees came together and suffered from the difficulty of breathing .
the spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the most important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed would do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates on the current state will keep from 0 @-@ 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest set on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation in which a major central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Head of Staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less sty outlook on global circumstances .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the indications point out that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 8 pm GMT on Thursday
death Prot@@ ector at Delta State University leave behind exc@@ uses
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning , and before he shot and killed his colleague later on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; during the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; announced authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social scientific education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and said he had shot on someone and killed someone .
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that the police had to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
as police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 , which said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted I , I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb sailed 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally killed his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was working online at home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb had called up a relative at a certain point on Monday to tell them that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville on that night , Lamb ro@@ de his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. title from Delta State University in spring 2015 .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor also allegedly tried to fight drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this certainly requires its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa build the Group
Lufthansa plans a large corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros per year with a better organization alone .
150 of the worldwide approximately 1000 leaders will cost the work@@ station conversion .
however , there are new negotiations with the pilot @-@ union .
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates Eu@@ row@@ ings in cheaper ways .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is to contribute to earnings of around ‚Ç¨ 500 million per year in terms of cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , there will be no Executive Board more for the passenger business in the future .
the budget airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the management team headed by Chef Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new setting , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group will in future compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
until now , the organisation of the 120 000 employees was highly complex .
the airlines operate under the Airline Group &apos;s roof , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict of tari@@ ff with the pilot association Cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations after the j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal strike on this Thursday are to be resum@@ ed .
this divided the union .
the theme of the talks should be retirement regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a forec@@ asted record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be able to produce results as quickly as possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline led to various strikes over the past few months .
in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is &quot; Wings . &quot;
it is obvious that in the fight against competitors Lufthansa is dispos@@ ing of Eu@@ row@@ ings , the Group &apos;s own low @-@ cost line .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
in PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this won the left outdoor defender and won him out for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season again .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg rac@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operate in Manchester .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then it happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the im@@ position of an elite meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian ump@@ ire had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a mo@@ m and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
reference : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w to defeat PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the defender of England has an additional incentive to recover until the coming of June .
Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ √©s Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to hospital - after a oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Minister @-@ President for The Lor@@ ax decided , the eco @-@ label published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on Super@@ camp &apos;s website , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read to my children , as it always seems to be a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , is instead a summary of the 2012 movie version that added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy called T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and who died in 1991 , however completely unknown .
as if this is not yet suspi@@ cious : the text presented by Cameron is partially like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy called T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , Cameron seems unlikely to be so familiar with the story of the book . here an un@@ named boy hears , as the local environment is devast@@ ated by the gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ tering , Th@@ need frustr@@ ating on@@ ce @-@ ler , in spite of the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a cour@@ a@@ geous being , &quot; speaking in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s voters circle office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no other immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , repe@@ ating the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a forward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin punch and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
here related news : Adam Ly@@ th dies out of the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that ti@@ cket@@ players are oriented to results .
there were no question marks with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination since - and I told this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully kno@@ cks out more of Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude even if he didn &apos;t get so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is mainly a team man .
the question of how much time a test hit receives to set its mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick got comp@@ ton nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that could be raised was that England first put down Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a drummer , whom I set up high rates .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of making mos@@ ques beside Cook , which would provide an extra spin punch and four qui@@ cks would get , appeared and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a cri@@ cket player &apos;s Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l .
Mo@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred re@@ ins at once and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited interaction with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see their stat@@ s - on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spins that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made some clever additions to the coaching staff .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience , as he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball @-@ stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can profit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used by the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team leaders do not determine the schedule .
and you have to remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy of heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Britain &apos;s exit from the EU ) could gain Zul@@ auf if the economy is in a sl@@ um by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ expanded ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will go deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought viol@@ ently because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states are so deeply mired in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from their own guilt , Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves before a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes an out@@ sider Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do not let us alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials came to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Angela Merkel &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it has been done in the over@@ power@@ ing long @-@ term prot@@ esters like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French President Fran√ßois Hollande is looking forward to his re @-@ election or re @-@ election in 2017 .
it is also an ex@@ tin@@ ct force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that they will pull a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Brit@@ ons whose energy should be better spent on preventing Scotland &apos;s leaving from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even intentionally not plan helpful comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , during Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press ar@@ one , as they did during the referendum , inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can f@@ aint by Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anen &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all his ma@@ dness Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sh@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ residents who own most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar to her but noted that if you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the un@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it a back door .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly rap@@ es@@ eed on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needed time for me - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980s , a mistake then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe is - I press it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional blo@@ c @-@ off tendency and the wild don@@ ors of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ England can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ett &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the boy sc@@ out fought in it , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70@@ ies when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ i &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow campaig@@ ners and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports at their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the touch@@ able bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to not give Cameron free ticket for Europe that allows him to hold &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lab@@ ours &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ i Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son believes that J@@ C has no campaign for leaving , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all , to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be all sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday by something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called .
experts critici@@ ze Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less damaging than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) in Lanc@@ et concluded by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health UK ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy basis &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to conduct their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received funding from British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding it should have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added .
the reasons for choosing the members of the committee are not supplied , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide industry funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the P@@ he tobacco line took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research work is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be@@ zeich@@ ung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for damage to most of the products on most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes may serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he said that the accus@@ ations of BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less damaging than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence is proof and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people annually die of a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by showing up @-@ to @-@ date evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ ward , former Chief of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ward and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK stations .
he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are public @-@ right programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience to place in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director General Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I do not consider for a good idea in the medium or long term , one should at least concentrate its production on programs that others do not do or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time slot because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax financing programs could be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ward is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this is to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s fault in the hunt for ratings is &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ ender should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue if they go to their hypo@@ sacred missions for the justification of 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value in this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you think everyone , we all think that for ¬£ 150 a year you get a great value here , but for those who have a lot of money for the 150 ¬£ a lot of money , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much from the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified in front of the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , educ@@ ate , and enter@@ tain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example of this in &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television are shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers Alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos; son@@ o@@ genetic &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by erup@@ tions of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction from the moment they reson@@ ate with sound pulses which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically altered to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called son@@ ogram , which can be used by ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said to the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep @-@ brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread@@ worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then enter into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the di@@ aphrag@@ ms of some of the worm cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultrasound to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetic , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Sizegenetics could have some advantages over this technique .
unlike light that needs to be sent down to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ onic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily disable the targeted human neur@@ ons in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

one of the par@@ o@@ dy displays produced by Special Pat@@ rol Group .
according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ in@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries .
many artists join forces with activists within protest movements and realize that they have to move outside into the real world , so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ weapons trade posters is greeting commuters on the subway .
the Am@@ ne@@ sty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist , who also works for free .
V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the fair - through a le@@ asing of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic tender company advertisement , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ff@@ ing with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a drop in the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally on our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors p@@ addle fantas@@ tically eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved into a student residence , still in the belief in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I am angry - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed into eight simple rules .
the entry into student residence ranges from slightly annoying to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to chat : people tell you where you come from , where you come from , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly don &apos;t love nor hate Mar@@ m@@ ite , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not speak with even if your lashes were burning in fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people leave .
people &apos;s rooms are often transformed into beverage recipes , film night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress up and plu@@ ck their under@@ wear .
related to this : don &apos;t remember to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ vert receives a rough treatment at the University .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I have used for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of speaking : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
making friends through baking .
as you begin the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ie , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to present yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less odd than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to talk and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poor@@ ly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop sp@@ le@@ en for your tea too ?
check that with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , that &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to handle more balanced than my room@@ mate , who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours whether it makes them something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter than three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted to this with even more loud music .
when she finally woke up at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before leaving her own music , shut down her door and went into her three hour examination .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would enter the same student residence by chance ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be very aw@@ k@@ ward if you have a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , to take care of her , to divor@@ ce herself and then see her every day and perhaps to see how she brings together all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , at least try to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an el@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never negl@@ ect someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
shut down your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you put in the freezer - but do not t@@ ack@@ y their possessions on the ceiling more than twice .

&quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living space , but also the single mother and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dien@@ ne &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build good and good build today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheap living space can be created : it builds in a project of terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain here for a great deal .
in view of the flood of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution .
guil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs only a few places .
it facilitates integration .
that is different if the people are accommod@@ ated in blocks of flats .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it is again peace , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 Euro , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building instructions complicated their plans ?
guil@@ dner : I have legally drawn up my project .
especially complicated it always makes the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the regulation regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still subject to who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three plots .
there is no place for this in the cities .
refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
guil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury structures for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely isn &apos;t right .
but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : over the past five years , we had a building boom in Germany , but we built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dien@@ er .
I show you how to build today still cheap and well @-@ built .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , typing on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling us that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush is back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by stream@@ lining the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them as soon as the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may shut down half way and lead to a break@@ out of the update .

Ros@@ berg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one thing in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; before the start of the championship runner @-@ up , the Second World Cup stressed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the vice world champion before the race in Singapore on this Sunday of title defender and double champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on already won seven of the twelve races so far and will also win the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .
for days a ha@@ ze @-@ bell has been hanging over the city , triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ atra .
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was founded three months ago and has recorded another member in its ranks , thus increasing the membership to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1 . class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ √ºb@@ be@@ cke .
the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation that Chairman Alfred Klein met .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot make the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wants the membership to be seen in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ b√ºro looks for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the geri@@ at@@ ric centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new start point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consultations , you can also participate in courses there .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely , to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the purchase market , sen@@ iors and advice @-@ seek@@ ers receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or health care insurance benefits .
for years , with our ambul@@ ant nursing service , we find that nursing relatives are often left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , many services of the insur@@ ances are not seldom taken into account , because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new landlord J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; service as a business executive for the elderly and for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is seen by both business leaders in demographic change .
because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual parts of Bam@@ berg in the future essential .
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , and the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the simil@@ arity at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular social gathering . &quot;
in doing so , the social foundation makes a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2 pm , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o &apos;clock and Saturday from 10 am to 12 am .

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang died 92 years old
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Viennese architecture , is dead .
he died on September 5 at the age of 92 , as the K√ºnstler@@ haus announced on Tuesday .
with M@@ ang , the K√ºnstler@@ haus was given an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was stated in the broadcast .
born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the 1980s he was commissioned with the furnishing of the Treas@@ ury in the Hof@@ burg of Vienna and the renovation of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum .
parking penalty : Tim Wiese th@@ rows a polic@@ ew@@ oman with money
ex @-@ foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese is ung@@ utely noticed in Bremen .
foot@@ b@@ aller was once , meanwhile Tim Wiese , ex @-@ national guard in Germany and at Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim is engaged , w@@ rest@@ ler .
according to his statement , he plans to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
intellec@@ tually , he did not assign .
gr@@ ass@@ land had just cut his hair out in the inner city of Bremen when he saw a parking space guard standing outside for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
as a result , Wiese rus@@ hed out of the shop , insul@@ ted the police officer and repro@@ ached him with the fine fine of his feet , as reported by the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper .
in the city of Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations that the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only afterwards I decide whether meadow will be displayed or not .

men are beating 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses seek the police for a incident at Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft filling station .
there were also three people on the grounds of the gas station .
one of these men cried out to the young people and struck them with the f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ break at this time and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ st@@ ened and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first dismissed his sacrifice .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car up to their home and drove demonstr@@ atively several times there .
when the vehicle was no longer seen , the injured man went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male .
under the aid of a beat , one beat on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured person had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue activity description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket was supposed to have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and advis@@ ors to contact the phone number 06@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over practice of field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euros
Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank M√ºller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over the practice of rock breaks there on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still in half a position for his successor in the coming months .
after a conversion phase , M√ºller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests ‚Ç¨ 3@@ 10@@ 000 in the premises at St Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when Frank M√ºller and his wife met Frank M√ºller and his wife Dr. Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who are currently undergoing specialist training at the Ver@@ dener Hospital and also wants to go into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had the mind that the M√ºll@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was time , I just ph@@ oned them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of the couple M√ºller was to pursue their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mill@@ er .
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon .
and so one agreed that the mill@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank M√ºller has grown up there , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several doctor &apos;s offices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as a senior physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and is engaged in voluntary work in the DRC &apos;s willingness to invest in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19th , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ris@@ ausen works as a family practitioner , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the M√ºll@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a resident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the reconstruction the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
the computer is also completely renewed .
a total subsi@@ dy of ‚Ç¨ 50,000 is given to the mill@@ er as part of a funding program of the county ( 25,000 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that practice is being continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says MEP Bernd Bor@@ mann , Mayor of Zambia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , approximately 2000 patients come to the practice of rock breaks every quarter , in the average German average practice there are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s office .
a positive side effect of the practical transfer by Frank M√ºller : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus , the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor had found it , it would have gone too .
those who visit M√ºll@@ ers consultations continue to look especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the fel@@ lows .
with their f@@ arewell in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ len rec@@ alls .
she already felt a little melanch@@ oly after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds , laugh@@ ing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We have a 6,000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I &apos;ve always pushed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said interior minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this request . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the care and security of the people is in the foreground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s clear , too , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia denied
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would allow arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also set cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach didn &apos;t look like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
as the Minister pointed out , Sloven@@ ians plans to limit its borders for refugees but not to abri@@ dge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must complete its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government told us , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to leave the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia in order to ev@@ ade the registration .
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the nearby fields of corn .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have always been hit by the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is predominantly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rescue services and the Red Cross are already in action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the coming days , his country will reck@@ on with about 4,000 refugees , the Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ oj@@ ic , said .
in addition , there would be buses from Pres@@ evo on the Serbian @-@ Serbian border which had previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , diver@@ ted direction Croatia , compl@@ ying Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was it that people approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can neither , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the morning , but in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been on the road all night long from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border that was about 500 kilometres away from Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has done so , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany , Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could indeed lead to a postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a slightly further west .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister of the Interior , Ost@@ oj@@ ic , had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not refer to details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently made a good testimony to the country since then , regarding the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are still around 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely .
whether the remaining refugees want to continue traveling to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm the debate on Wednesday morning in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be about very high refugee figures at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
workers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war there are still not more spacious min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian work of Mannheim , which together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband , is the bearer of ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 year @-@ old is good .
the fact that not everyone wants to express themselves publicly , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the theme of death and death is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has greatly helped to open up people .
an assessment that shares An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid .
the mour@@ ning and mour@@ ning atten@@ dant is among the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid was looking for volunteers by calling , she immediately reported and had been involved in the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the suffer@@ ers and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
they are all carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her job and experience and experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another lu@@ te , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of the health insurance companies and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as further education and supervision of the dying and mour@@ ning support .
training for new employees is offered every two years .
the tablets described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protestant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
further personal wishes on post@@ cards can also be recorded there .
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial prospects lowered for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supplier giant lowered its profit outlook for an entire year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its freight transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. claimed to make a profit of between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ Set , analysts expected $ 10.@@ 84 .
the lower cost comes in spite of the price increases , which will be 4.@@ 9 percent on average and effective on January 4 and despite higher sur@@ charges for heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November onwards .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and growth in online stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the Company considers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid income &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vacation employment were announced a day later than that of the rival UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , for example the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve analysts asked by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts asked analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has seen a decline in international priority dispatch , which resulted in sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices while the result fell due to higher labour costs in freight business .
in the pre@@ market trading , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is im@@ min@@ ent over them at the end of the orn@@ ate , two @-@ storey seat hall .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from the Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive by the short @-@ term interest rate that is close to zero since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ous to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest for federal loans - and be it only a quarter of percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification for continuing to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which in itself sec@@ ures the financial market .
about half of econom@@ ists recently surv@@ eyed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase .
this points to a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts l@@ essen the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average j@@ umped by 21.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in explaining the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty as to when the F@@ ed would act .
one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow intensi@@ fication of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence acquired .
although the job creation slow@@ ed in August , improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed considers full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world picked up at the end of the month after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage was more than 16 % below its peak in May , as investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat this month , with D@@ ow now being almost 10 % below the high of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation when the interest rate is to be increased .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy wouldn &apos;t have occurred in the last few weeks , they would attract re@@ ins in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US central bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about the impact on the US economy and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included technically in its decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed has become the world &apos;s F@@ ed .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its monetary expansion , spark@@ ed con@@ fu@@ sions around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect that they not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company , En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ier , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , observed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on the financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
co@@ ater , right @-@ wing member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advoc@@ ates a raise interest rate , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limit@@ less noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ner .
one year later the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability to the first place only during a severe crisis such as the quar@@ ry in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should ha@@ sten the time .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Cost@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public .
yes , it is in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town .
the market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations .
there is even a car division if you need engine oil .
the shop is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the cor@@ rid@@ ors .
if the whole shop makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express for you .
the G@@ ark@@ √º@@ che ( good and inexpensive ) in this store is close to the till@@ s and has various pick @-@ up options .
what is there : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are cheap and a number of them is sold in large quantities .
fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs , fruits and more .
the meat counter is extensive , as is the fish bar - the staff behind the counter will clean and filter the fish and even fry on demand for you .
a good part of the store belongs to the massive freezing compartment . here you will find frozen curr@@ y leaves , bitter mel@@ on and gal@@ ang@@ al , whole du@@ cks , fish , beef stock and g@@ all , pigs natural gut , fish balls , regional saus@@ age , commercially prepared food and more .
who bu@@ ys here : restaurant owners and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals .
the wide gears are suitable for trol@@ leys and forklift trucks .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian next to the cas@@ hier .
where it is located : the store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original .
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area , along with other shops and restaurants .
even if the shop is well attended , it is not difficult to find a parking place .
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
even with her 74 differences , she still likes to teach .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er home at D@@ ill@@ inger Stra√üe .
there she helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , this is quite a different lesson than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande fo@@ sters nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women about how important good food is during breast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should do .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy nutrition of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the town council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the EUR 2.3 million expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ around building at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council meeting , the completed construction application has been unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
prior to this , the committee decided , among other things , a motion for a statutory &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the current development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was permission for a special form regarding the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gab@@ led roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected with a non @-@ bearing first and roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this brings together a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof inclin@@ ation , which for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the building plan allows no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the roof inclin@@ ation - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Council generally drives more restric@@ tively in the case of exemp@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recurring project for gymn@@ astic construction : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and of the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are estimated at the cost .
supplements are expected from school and width sports promotion .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall is now presented to the District Council for the examination .
clinic P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the hospital of Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the District Hospital GmbH of the district , which confirmed Land@@ r√§@@ tin Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and will meet on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg hospital .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing internal station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au will be offered a job at Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü .
the employees were informed of the plans .
the change is triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year , and is now moving to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who should succeed , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the leadership from October 1 and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside .
for the next two years , Fischer and his team will , if the Supervisory Board appro@@ ves , run both houses , until next year the former hospital of the pop@@ lar , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refur@@ bish@@ ment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
Land@@ r√§@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , argued that the house , which is owned by the federal government , is to be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I conclude that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü was not able to say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a conference psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer on the move to Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positively and comprehen@@ sively &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taken by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has not been given a real perspective for the house where Fischer has worked as a chief physician for over 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg Hospital ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened again and again in the past decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Li@@ ons are demanded tonight at the Berg@@ ische HC in the evening ( 8.@@ 15 pm ) .

Jag@@ dies with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a ma@@ ize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hun@@ ts@@ men were in use as the police ha@@ st@@ ened .
after a shot , an 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered grave injuries and were put into hospitals .
it was unclear how exactly this could happen to the accident .
the det@@ ective police were determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a police officer has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who have been missing since Saturday .
in the inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave up , the young people were killed and their dead bodies were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who was missing since Saturday , fell victim to a crime of violence .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ utor and police announced on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was taken on Tuesday evening , is also deemed to be active , who , according to fact , admitted the statement and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed on the eve of a visit to the autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators stum@@ bled upon personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the event of ques@@ tioning in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing , there was eventually a crime suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee gave the authorities the police inter@@ ro@@ gation to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ ses in the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be brought forward to the prison @-@ fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a dead end to him .
the further investigation is to shed light on the near@@ er circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are also looking for a affordable place to stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution campaigns on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the coming refugees and j@@ ob@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction industry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units will be completed in Germany this year .
this means that 14@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seek@@ ers in their original accommodation .
many then encounter the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing construction policy of recent years .
Germany is aiming for a housing deficit that will grow from year to year .
currently , some 77@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias G√ºnther , author of the study , compl@@ ains .
for this reason , many people with a job lived in large cities in the vicinity of flat @-@ room flats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the f@@ lau@@ ts on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has decreased for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance proposes a restart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to revi@@ ve new incentives for social housing construction .
thus the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the property tax for subsidi@@ zed homes will be suspended for a limited time .
in addition , attractive tax depreciation methods are necessary according to the alliance .
the support programme for refugee shel@@ ters in the state bank Kf@@ W is already well @-@ known in cities and communities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the total cost of ‚Ç¨ 184 million was rec@@ alled on Monday evening .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have a free time : Croatia and Slovenia set a corridor
there is practically no more coming to Hungary , as more and more refugees choose their way through Croatia .
Zagreb canc@@ els the transit across Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nonetheless .
Croatia wants to agree with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Slovenian Minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ oj@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the exp@@ ul@@ sion of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have broken up to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
the Croatian television broad@@ ca@@ ster RT@@ L reports that 500 people had come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
Hungary had signed its border for refugees on the previous day .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , also render superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the neighbouring country of Croatia in the morning .
according to media reports , most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately upon arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees do not encounter fen@@ ders .
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90@@ s .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a secure passage .
according to Hungary , there are hardly any more refugees after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 challenged people .
shortly before closing on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws en@@ force the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a criminal off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
35 pen@@ alties were therefore introduced in Sz@@ eg@@ ed in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted thre@@ aten prison sentences of up to five years and deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; Tran@@ sit zones &quot; set up at the border , of which almost all - 93 - were the most important transition of R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants there are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees would have stayed there .
practically no one has a prospect of receiving asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up with it .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the road@@ side in recent weeks .
barriers were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border area was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to comment on the purpose of this remo@@ del@@ ing .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but around 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government data .
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing there were regularly smaller groups of refugees on foot .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Br√ºck@@ en@@ fest on Sunday we were busy with the clearing , when suddenly ten people stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly set off rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , due to the refugee flow , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the stu@@ ds together with two other assistants and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
before that , we first ta@@ sted the unexpected guests , with snacks and drinks .
we put it straight away , we bring it by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ √ñ@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let him take a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE into a regional train to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening , in order to try it after the short notice that rail traffic was stopped to Germany , but still trying to cross the border .
the regional train was stopped at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Br√ºck@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , day before a two @-@ brid@@ ged sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ √°n now sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of ai@@ ding in the R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor officially en@@ chan@@ ted the attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ ston of National Socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only the Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chao@@ tic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which they invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge to produce decent conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in view of the ongoing flood of refugees and the approaching winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad looking for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ proof quartz
Konrad has to do all his hands with the transfer of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ker to place lod@@ g@@ ings for thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chaos in the first training centre in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gotten a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the placing of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without great confusion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a need of 8@@ 5,000 in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , some 35@@ ,000 units will have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 should supply the federal states , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the country tri@@ bun@@ als .
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the refugees to come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂n@@ born , thereby clari@@ fying how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations in the ORF campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , you are hoping for hotels that are empty during the winter .
yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that district providers must respect a certain amount of the towel @-@ holders or gran@@ deur of the duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad founded his experience that in contrast to the ministry of the interior he was more successful in placing an accommodation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without another into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asive power is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cost the republic as they stated .
their number of employees want to increase them to three to four .
the own quest for accommodation has not been successful so far .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
for the time being no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ arena and design center for accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons affected can currently be accommod@@ ated without these measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites should be tested for their suitability .
the city chief critic@@ ises the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a long telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , governor Josef P@@ √ºhr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday corro@@ bor@@ ated the further course of action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be sealed .
the continuation of refugees into the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will not give any more .
however , the asylum seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ √ºhr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for P@@ √ºhr@@ inger , too , Austria is now introducing a logical consequence of the action taken by the Germans for P@@ √ºhr@@ inger .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; in the Linz industry line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT company S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the Technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup companies in the New Wer@@ ft and later to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at 1.7 million euros , S &amp; T invested ‚Ç¨ 3.3 million from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the province of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are en@@ quiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second store in the ar@@ cade
in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the focal point .
actually J@@ utta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade : finally , she got an increase in the form of a further local area .
in the Fur@@ la shop in front of the shop in which it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , it is now all about women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have thought for a long time if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among other things , the decision was that even the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a very own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has got incu@@ bation from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I work most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why so many women come into rap@@ ture when seeing a beautiful hand@@ bag ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag re@@ inv@@ ents every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ du@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called investors .
some people also associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become a US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for set@@ ups .
whether it expresses itself to a foreign hostile crowd , as regards journalists or gaps in knowledge in international crisis politics - the candidate for the U.S. Pres@@ idency inspir@@ es the election campaign power@@ fully .
and cut off well .
this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the hair@@ dresser is known to many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf an der Wein@@ stra√üe .
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ place is related to it over -@@ nin@@ ety corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del made a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting somehow , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native city of K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous sho@@ ots , to which besides Tr@@ ump also includes the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit of a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within the radius , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ du@@ es@@ macher &quot; - to Hoch@@ deutsch : the l@@ ender , she says .
thus , Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the l@@ ender .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
first real estate sales in New York were the corner@@ stone of the real estate group .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to homeland permanently failed at the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ onic History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly spoken out about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a boundary wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as he does , this is not so sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the retired win@@ emaker seems to distance the American , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so start@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension keeper Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm insi@@ sts like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the family Heinz donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing in the US at the time of his grandfather would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah B√ºh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; my president isn &apos;t it , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , viewed for a long time for the Tr@@ ump , has seen 12 000 cinema fans , also in the USA arous@@ ed interest .
the Upper Bavarian community Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
from the hands of the Vice @-@ President at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain @-@ clim@@ ber villages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in neighbouring countries , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the today show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no great shift in the ratings for today .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sunrise , with the pres@@ enters David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Niag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play no part in Australian TV viewers , as Sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators in the five major cities compared to the today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number lag@@ ged behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , in the past few months , Today has closed the gap to Sunrise .
in August Today , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up to now in September , sunrise at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 viewers is at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decided to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics asked whether Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and struck slightly The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL Sagrada Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , presented 44@@ 6.000 spectators on average .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia generated 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour was 7@@ 20,000 .
average hot Se@@ at 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may unknow@@ ingly have evi@@ dently suspected who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood landed in The Bachelor , was wrapped up in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked in with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three , you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips firmly closed until the final on Thursday
all three women have expressed themselves in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods Final Rose &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; her answers could become a destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki named both quickly - except for themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed , I felt they were quite compatible and I thought it throughout the course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a pair .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house made it clear last week that Wood could be &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now def@@ end@@ lessly set to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on the 10th of Wednesday , 7 : 30 am .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle expressed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams looking for en@@ quiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the ban@@ ker when he lost a sc@@ ram@@ ble , as did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies to the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , he also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first game quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian band had hoped for for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut at that time in 2007 , when a pass led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free voters are demanding the recruitment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn class Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger was warned of a severe crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; otherwise we will get awards in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parliament &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parliament &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free voters &apos; meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as existed during the former Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one free voters as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for administrative dishes that are responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W chief critici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards for federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria postpon@@ es , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the regional policy in large @-@ wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
years of long @-@ term bur@@ ners are on the agenda : educational policy .
for the new school year , the Minister of Education , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot project &quot; Medi@@ stage plus , &quot; where an extension of the secondary school was tested for three to four years .
but that &apos;s not far enough for Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all the high schools wishing to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever it is desired .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd which demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , some of whom threw stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used tear gas and then poured into the air before they res@@ or@@ ted to rubber stories .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber stories used , which are known to be able to kill , but which are traditionally used as a less mortal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces that are formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of V@@ arus who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th century .
when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been governed centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mandu and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city

the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the premises for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
you are waiting for appropriate offers , it says on the part of the city .
which investor is to be questioned is not yet clear .

now there are plans for a new holiday res@@ ett@@ lement near Em@@ den near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der Company &quot; System @-@ Building , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Town Development Committee of the Em@@ der Council .

under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ asing went on the offensive from system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ours .
for months , the project has been under discussion for some ten to twelve million euros .
intense reactions among marine land@@ owners who had come to the meeting called the pictures and new details about the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and a member of the board at the advoc@@ acy of the advoc@@ ate , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is an enormous block that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like many other project critics that traffic would greatly increase due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whole bus@@ loads must come to expect that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what is happening on the well @-@ a @-@ hectare area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , we must have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ trends . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Google launches Dou@@ bling Don@@ ation Camp@@ aig@@ n to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( Google &apos;s O ) announced a dou@@ bling Don@@ ation Camp@@ aig@@ n which aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ rolled the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the Don@@ ation call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google colleague who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark railway and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally raised donations up to a value of 5.5 million were doubled to USD 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many escaped from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for obes@@ e patients .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new trial .
it is still too early to say whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to eat food .
over the years obesity has proven to be efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are overweight with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and stomach ul@@ c@@ ers - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained close to 29 for those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments .
among those undergoing surgical intervention , 36 % of the diabetes disorder was completely dissolved and 28 % in total .
in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent , and in some cases , only about two percent .
in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and bad LD@@ L cholesterol in general were better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , according to researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team compared also average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rek@@ tom@@ ie group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger responses in BM@@ I ( 7.1 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded more overall diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study showed no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years in obes@@ e people - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long to take people seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , revers@@ ing is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ √ºck
it is an issue that is currently becoming increasingly important in fiction : a young woman , un@@ fav@@ oured in school times , and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , after years hits the flock of her youth , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story the novel might be interesting especially for Hun@@ s@@ r√ºck@@ er readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .

&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying .
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that , under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be confronted with the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and found out that the violent reaction of the US drag@@ ged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I told him that the way to resolve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
quad@@ ru@@ ple increase in intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
poison control centres in the USA report about an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , who swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , cases of proceeds of hand dis@@ infection in children under 12 years of age , reporting poison control centres , increased from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more common with these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said some children drinking dis@@ infection products intentionally , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of nuts in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink dis@@ infection products only because of a cheap experience .
young people have allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with non @-@ alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash in order to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing for children .
hand dis@@ infection products contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially small children can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation a few sy@@ ring@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the emergency emergency centre at the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you would not leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come from it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es of straw@@ berry fra@@ grant drugs in the school , was put into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered dr@@ unken in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor who treated her in the G@@ inn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah loved her words and was not able to leave when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on the signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through alcohol and had pushed her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &quot; mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ infection clo@@ ths and to store hand dis@@ infection products out of the reach of the child .
in addition to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing down disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth grade in New York State planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by placing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iles them from their space .
the police looked at the em@@ ulated plan as &quot; W@@ aters &quot; and assigned disciplinary action to the school authority .

it is because the R@@ angers are not there .

after the defeat against Malm@@ √∂ and the following departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen was followed , which now with five points lead is clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic already had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel the same - but we have to go on .
we really need to really support Cel@@ tic because it makes the players better .
getting together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton careful during January @-@ transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , suggest@@ ing that he sp@@ ends some January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious when signing new records and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unit of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Cel@@ tic target person Mich@@ u with reference link
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ St√ºr@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Cel@@ tic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires at the sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has pl@@ agu@@ ed himself with a troubles@@ ome an@@ kl@@ es for two years and has not made the departure from Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts set up on S@@ FA battle for N@@ eil@@ son comments
the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent out of the field and lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of Defender was later repe@@ aled - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insist@@ ed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not questioned integrity , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swe@@ ars Griff@@ i@@ ths to avoid ty@@ nec@@ le
the in@@ cor@@ rup@@ tible Hi@@ bee was rejected after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the storm and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Cel@@ tic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s Management Board still has confidence in the management team to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn things &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but admit that the down@@ fall has to end on the playing field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has faith in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to the track again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ In@@ nes happy to win against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ In@@ nes ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in desper@@ ation to see a seventh consecutive league victory that gave them a lead of five points ahead of Cel@@ tic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ In@@ nes said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or songs that have not won games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , as it increases overall in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July , unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole in the same period rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over the 5.5 percent U@@ K@@ s , as the Bureau for National Statistics ( O@@ NS ) showed .
meanwhile employment in Scotland fell 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken distur@@ b@@ ance the process
as security personnel were unable to satisfy the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the officials could take the stur@@ geons in custody .
a breath alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0,@@ 89 per mil@@ le .
the adolescents were picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2.@@ 15 per mil@@ le and initially remained in custody .
why I &apos;m witness@@ ing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator &apos;s gallery in the death chamber in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p executed through the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was already made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and since more applications are available as seats , a mak@@ eup of lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ sy &apos;s closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship in the course of the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the prisoner &apos;s story about how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get it better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter from Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the Pod@@ casts series I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong possibility that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked to the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer trying to &quot; persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a house peace event in Becken@@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards the C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about getting his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , cous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and thre@@ aten to finish racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that Racing Victoria &apos;s ste@@ wards tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive cob@@ alt tu@@ ft rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age reproach and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with that which I have said .
tonight I will go home and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a sc@@ am .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , reig@@ ning President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the point that it becomes personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people out there think I &apos;m .
perhaps they have to take my license and leave me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now about to reflect on them .
but I have now arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching added that he said that he could &quot; cast his license above the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ folded master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a package of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my colleagues mistakenly put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been like that yesterday all day , which was so .
but it was also so on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy defe@@ ats ri@@ vals due to alleg@@ ations about ring fighting
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda setting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the Storm players &quot; E@@ ring battles &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a hardly disgu@@ ised note to the Storm Team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the stap@@ le of his team and said that they were only focused on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the Tac@@ kl@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team is confident that they were worried that they were worried about being hit by the storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows up again and again - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Robinson talking about ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything to our def@@ en@@ sive system or techniques all year round . but over the past six weeks , we have made our contact at Tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus , and this has provided us with the trend revers@@ al .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not used to getting used to it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it &apos;s funny how this always appears at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the premi@@ er league in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game that you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it came to big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters had a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is it an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me , it &apos;s the game boards .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team was free on this weekend as they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday evening in the atri@@ fin@@ als at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Serbian with $ 200,000 deposit on drug swa@@ p
a man potentially threatened with a lifetime punishment due to his attempt to come into the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released for a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed as he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Caf√© Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole crowd and that it could have been a harmless reason in the caf√© .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape with Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mac@@ si@@ movi@@ k &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the official statements of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports daily to the police and is holding himself to an initial stop of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at highway A5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab ri@@ ps apart
during a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in the direction of Basel before a permanent construction site .
the third driver noticed it too late , trying in vain to turn left in the last moment , as the police told us .
the driver &apos;s cab of the collision caused completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours to 2 am .
there was a damage of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl in order to demand images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when she fell asleep , logged in to an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found at the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches , which used terms for the search for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to officials that he had done it , since it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educ@@ ators on the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the public prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on , said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction , - that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ aring people .
he admitted that searches on the computer were carried out by him , but he said it had happened because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked after his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to enti@@ ce them .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone , she called her mother and was on the trem@@ bling and crying .
she also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and faced the def@@ end@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the In@@ dict@@ ment of having in@@ decent images of children on June 14 last year , to have viol@@ ated the obligations on 25 January this year and did not appear before court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defense lawyer Greg@@ or S@@ im requested that H@@ og@@ g would not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders since one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be found in its off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael disappeared until October to obtain background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted deposit in this case but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings to other still pending cases .
he was taken up before the sent@@ encing date into the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
tu@@ gs move on small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are being taken up from the main control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many tu@@ gs were driven by fear of discovery and arrest of people on smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the federal police said .
more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn along the river Inn .
they were on foot over bridges and dam@@ s on the German side .
there they are received by the Federal Police and forwarded to the registration .
in comparison to the beginning of the week , more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station in comparison with the beginning of the week .
about 700 people arrived in the capital alone until 8 am , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ners of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart announced .
the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the &quot; Henry &quot; tropical storm , which in the past few days was drawn by the Bermuda Islands via the Atlantic .
storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , even until Thursday early in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ se@@ seek@@ er with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour are to be expected .
on Friday , the sun will last longer .
the crowd makes it : every two years , the car manufacturers at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2015 is especially noticeable in the compact cars that are currently selling very well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in great demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for by the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) alone in August this segment .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days from September 17 to 27 ) .
many new compact models will be presented this year between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new premium cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in the fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are deser@@ ved
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the judicial exec@@ ution@@ er Te@@ gel , who was accommod@@ ated in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a resolution published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , they can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was lod@@ ged in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , is now on his free foot , was transferred to a larger cell .
his office liability due to the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the country of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges raised the verdict of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re@@ trial .
they see human dignity being hurt .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , from the question@@ able period of time there were only a few days of prison for the compensation , a compensation claim was given , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear a disgu@@ ise of the legal protection of the personality &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber Court must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the Constitutional Court has often strengthened the rights of prisoners of law .
so they said in April to a prisoner of in@@ dem@@ nity , because he was confined naked in a cell .
a man &apos;s decision from 2011 also indicates the multiple allocation of a cell without separate toilet .
furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had certified a prisoner of in@@ decent housing in a parallel fall in November 2009 .
over a period of three months , the plain@@ ti@@ ff at that time was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in the last weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had come to the head@@ lines because of missing personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to slaughter it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to information from the judicial office , 21 jobs in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to young lack of young people , 19 are to drop off in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we manage this &quot;
the migration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800@@ ,000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can create that and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to a range of forecasts between 350 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of construction ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) , apartments are used every year for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 welfare apartments fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply to refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) is therefore aiming to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing per year would have to be built and the Con@@ federation would have to invest a funding of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
the researchers and the Federal Ministry of Building agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investing in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not asked systematically for their qualifications to help them get started , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial that they find jobs in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the industrial society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; there has been a political change : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise labour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the residence obligation to limit asylum seek@@ ers to a residence .
in society - also because of the lack of skills - a majority of the points of view have prevailed that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market more quickly .
lack of German knowledge is a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market .
up to now there is still no adequate supply of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often conveyed through personal contacts .
for this reason , the creation of networks is , according to the opinion of Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt , the K√∂nigs@@ weg for labour integration .
the Berlin school administration found that only a few fled parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; it is first of all important for parents to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ esch@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in Berlin Senate administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ sheets in various languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators increase sharply by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for instance by allowing more technical colle@@ ges .
students in the countries will be prepared for lessons without German knowledge in welcome classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state prohibited asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) so far removed his stance .
study willing refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
because refugees with a residence permit or D@@ ul@@ dung do not receive any benefits in accordance with the asylum seek@@ er performance law if they start studying .
the latter basically don &apos;t get a b@@ af@@ √∂@@ g , because they do not fall under the circle of the af@@ √∂@@ gam@@ entitled persons .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g , from January 1 , 2016 , this can be shortened to 15 months .
however , this financing gap must also be closed , called Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get b@@ af@@ √∂@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively apply the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state @-@ church right to a new state religion relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic charity , which will take care of new arri@@ vals professionally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; duties also belong to the rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant them certain controls .
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
those who wanted to off@@ end such conflicts in Germany &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will hen@@ ce@@ forth be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
in this way , the majority society will also have to change , forcing the elimination of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and an equality law since a decade .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ murder @-@ series showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and interest groups of non @-@ white German have long been demanding and why international tre@@ aties such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention Germany commit must become reality in the next few years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens want to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medi@@ cally care to the refugees that have so far been expecting , says Dr. Frank Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however additional money has to flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery invites everyone to sign up health cards immediately upon registration .
provided services could later be bil@@ led with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able that so many people are subscri@@ bed to the limited range of services provided by the Asyl@@ um App@@ lic@@ ant Act .
other than that , the doctors are doing the language barriers above all .
as before , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are getting worse off their diseases than other patients .
not only in hospitals , also in doctor &apos;s offices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over , it demands .
many refugees would also be helped with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
there are clearly more untreated obstruc@@ tions among refugee children , and among young people it is about HIV @-@ raising .
with the partly other disease pictures , German doctors come from their training but clear , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the lack of doctors , the refugees may even have relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians had a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates of the Federal Psycho@@ therapy Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
especially vulnerable are refugee children , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash @-@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and fear of death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , severe fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z stated .
so far only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers may submit an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , but the treatment usually lasts several months .
in addition , social workers or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the arena on the brick for dre@@ aming .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Tibetan teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current Man@@ e@@ gen@@ st@@ aging .
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift to the am@@ ate@@ urs is therefore in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to take away people from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with a cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the program of the Circus impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , it wants to easily record the Cuban duo .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
apart from numerous sal@@ mon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with feeling of finger and jo@@ int@@ iness .
balancing on a ball with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
no problem for He Yuan .
fascinated and frigh@@ tened at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with its ag@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst took a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we are not going well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called lov@@ ingly , is read by the eyes of every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to cooperate with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
the first commandment : good for animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together for eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but for that it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there &apos;s something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst says : &quot; regardless of whether five or more than 200 people , we always give our best and are with all our heart . &quot;
from September 17 to 20 , Circus Pro@@ bst will invite you to take part in your performances every day at 5 : 00 pm and 20 : 00 pm .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .

in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open every day from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe : Robert Mu@@ gabe positions wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also troubled by asser@@ tions by members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and were warned against accompanying Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
last month , they had rested him and stopped him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told repor@@ ters after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the concerned Parliament members that immunity in the Parliament ends and as soon as they leave the Parliament , parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard prints up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
this year HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service business activities .
the expected job reduction will lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering previously un@@ parall@@ eled , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it divi@@ des a company founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage one called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to handle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the conviction that tightly focused companies provide better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in the face of his history his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season strongly after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in conjunction with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Premier Inj@@ uries Ltd has registered 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played 157 league games in 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for ar@@ senal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which recorded most of the vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the rate of injury will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a period of time , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win battle power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ senal launched its Champions League Cup on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the play against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces itself a rotation within the team .
H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ √≠n and Aaron Ram@@ sey travelled not to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are expected to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to take a little break @-@ break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although ar@@ senal &apos;s clear favorites are to move through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the greatest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , being measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Ar@@ senal has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the far @-@ away hope to lead the association to his first European Cup triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked with Ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show giving us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove to be on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 marked the man &apos;s year aimed at ques@@ tioning the culture that men are preventing help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends once so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with their emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even when in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and how a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was turned up@@ side down .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which , through interaction as a friend , gle@@ amed .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments while watching football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing for Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even though they often with@@ hold their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone counsel@@ ing explained to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ destruc@@ tible , has clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G rent Malm@@ √∂
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ √∂ .
di Maria meets on Tuesday with his debut in the Champions League and helps PS@@ G to pass Malm@@ √∂ .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ √∂ in the princes park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ √º@@ ts as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the road , but afterwards she missed a number of occasions before she finally raised her lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head @-@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , since they strive not only qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out l@@ aps , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but as they got the points , it wasn &apos;t a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced by his home town team and against the association with which he started his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems to our opponents , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t achieved one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which ended on the weekend a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was exp@@ elled in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was described as the man who took PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he suggested why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ √∂ defense , before he passed by Johan Wil@@ and to the long corner of the network .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ √∂ , who struck Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was lined up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle ground a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes got up , with some mis@@ passes and bad deals , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scrat@@ ched in the first half of not less than five attempts , and then abandoned after having used him after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved far more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c that Di Maria turned into a shot that was guided by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ...
the second door finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved its sixth position after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thought that Malm@@ √∂ could return to the game , and only an outstanding intervention of Wil@@ and from very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the final result low before the substitute player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been recognized by a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ √∂ , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class with his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last champion league game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification matches do not suff@@ ice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core g@@ athers 2.5 billion dollars through stock sales
the Switzerland @-@ based mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is affected by collap@@ sing commodity prices , accumulated $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge redemption plan .
the London registered company Gl@@ en@@ core said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion pounds to pay off its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of reference rights gave Gl@@ en@@ cores &apos;s share price on trading in the early Wednesday morning a rapid increase to the top of the London stock exchange .
the share rose by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core announced last week the 2.5 billion dollar share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to pay around one @-@ third of its 30 billion dollar debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares in the value of up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other raw materials prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented switch to FC Bayern 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago shortly before the obligation of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champion league champion , twice champion champion , two times European champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and switched to Qatar &apos;s al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was standing in Barcelona before the Euro 2008 .
&quot; I told me that Bar@@ √ßa wanted to sell me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid then won everything , we have nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this also recorded the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ m@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in memory : in the summer of 2008 J√ºrgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is now working for the German record champion : pe@@ p Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; Bar@@ √ßa has contracted Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that , he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have gone with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , switched the reds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays down diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
during a sequence of Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the necessity of alternative perspectives , in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen scenario .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , do it with the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian fes@@ tiv@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about - whoever will be the director - how they treat the character of the Harmony , &quot; Brown first said .
the only black person , and she is a nun who is beaten by her white condition .
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing right to film ; Dam@@ on replied that &quot; at the end of our stage , &quot; what we do not want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded against dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WH@@ ITE it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white officer in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement scored a country @-@ wide impact and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against the coloured inclusion .
in February Prince Prince made a reference to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ ats who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns the first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and help guide Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million .
the competition show , which just ended its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who completed all stages of his obstacle course .
during the seasonal finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task included climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ lete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! breaking news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of 1 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deser@@ ved or lived for more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! over his pile of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how it is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course , won &apos;t get any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it gets the great priv@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; if I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think that Isaac felt as if they had exchanged the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth relay , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand in the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb inside a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) scored 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is difficult to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen of each game , and so I want to concentrate fully in the game .
the designated tiger hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle mar@@ in@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sw@@ ung the ch@@ unks well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( stroke training ) , looked clearly better at the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back@@ lash at the end of the seventh inn@@ ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second B@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy crossed the wall , the only man he was confronted with , before the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who delivered a two @-@ run to the right @-@ h@@ anders Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the end Run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third B@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League in this season that pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
when Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth inside , wall made an R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by an even not moving Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after ste@@ aling more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches out there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off B@@ atter , he released a single to Second B@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; on the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the runner in the scor@@ ing position .
the third b@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , but he managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers ranked second , achieved a one @-@ out double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or .
he did not beat very well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ k@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the limbs .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder @-@ down lashing , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is painted by the vulner@@ ability list to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing in the right hip joint since the 20th of August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who died there should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this event in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily accommod@@ ated there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse have arrived in the pres@@ idency of Gie@@ √üen , responsible for the initial up@@ take .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have furnished emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective displacement &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict crashes on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid on the ground for the refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austrian Home Secretary , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , announced on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV broad@@ ca@@ ster ORF , no @-@ one will be sent back to Hungary .
also Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the question of an agreement on which Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Safety and the Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany .
she did not give concrete numbers and referred to conversations on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
in view of the strong refugee policy in Germany , the Federal Government wants to support countries more strongly in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the Con@@ federation will manage this jointly with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined , those people who needed protection would get it too .
but if you don &apos;t have a residence perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was clearly divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed its 175 km long border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania could also be crossed with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent tu@@ gs from mig@@ rating across Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of other migrants have embark@@ ed on their way to the Greek border .
spatial probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the iron p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus , a global ocean swe@@ eps .
this is followed by researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
the moon is therefore easy to stag@@ ger on its orbit around the ring planets .
although this motion is only small , but still too large for a permanently fixed orb , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the trade sheet &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
for a long time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes in the South Pole of Saturn in 2006 , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ ring of Saturn &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not cleared .
R@@ ama is missing in Munich for several weeks
the 1860 M√ºnchen has to ren@@ ounce Val@@ det R@@ ama , a passive actor , about a month .
an investigation showed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association announced .
R@@ ama was compl@@ aining about pain at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich Li@@ ons , the diagnosis &quot; is expected to cause a break of four weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we need to think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Sports Director Nec@@ at Ay@@ uda in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of a single professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Six@@ ties , however , first presented a defensive character as a training guest .
the 30 @-@ year old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at currently has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the possibility to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Austrian national player will start running on Thursday already on Thursday .

contrary to first fears , however , he remained without a severe trial .
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
they are exotic and juicy and sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his lean line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
for man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nonetheless : in them , B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor of beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruit therefore support sight , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body .
during the purchase , man@@ gan@@ ese should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ go can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste naturally pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go also gives hear@@ ty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US parcel service UPS represents up to 9@@ 5,000 aid for Christmas business in the USA .
the company has already begun recruitment of seasonal workers , announced UPS on Tuesday .
drivers are mainly looking for .
already last year , UPS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 aid .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , UPS and its competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making provisions since last year to be ready for the Christmas business .

first fo@@ il@@ storm , then distinctive cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alps side of the F@@ √∂hn breaks through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland ha@@ st@@ ened on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and during the night to Thursday the fo@@ eh@@ n blows through the fo@@ eh@@ er valleys partly with storm strength .
after the fo@@ iling on Thursday morning a striking cold front crosses us , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , gu@@ sts of wind and a drop of temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area over the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current .
on the north side of the Alps , the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys in the night .
as a result , the F@@ √∂hn blows from 60 to 100 km / h in the tor@@ so valleys with gu@@ sts from 60 to 100 km / h , occasionally and in particular in the Ur@@ ner@@ land with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ √∂hn is able to penetrate into the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even Or@@ can@@ ans of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday , F@@ √∂hn winds for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the mountain slope .
here the rain stops , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , to the south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , with partly over 100 liters of rain per square meter , this has to be reck@@ oned with since large rainf@@ alls have already fallen in the last few days .
on Thursday morning , the F@@ √∂hn winds its way , as a result , a cold front rolls with powerful , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east across Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind rises strongly to stor@@ m@@ ically , and the temperatures go back clearly .
the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south on the other hand it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Reform@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was applied to the community of evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran congregation in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were often only able to live in seclu@@ sion through centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the square becomes visible that the tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city then as a rotten be@@ ak .
his negative impressions , according to histori@@ ans , might have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the split of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against the decline .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the crown of thorns ( gold plated ) is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar has painted for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images .
in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motifs has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can be quite dark .
Ot@@ mar Alt worked for about three years in his Bible project , for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles that are devoted to themes such as cross roads , pl@@ agues , commandments , or fa@@ therhood .
he has always been fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the biblical passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpre@@ ts the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar &apos;s Old and thus translated into current contexts today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately triggered for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant Sovereign Order of Malta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education was already done with the cane stock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work out , in order to be able to carry me back with the Lord &apos;s Father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to re @-@ emp@@ ower art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is now characterised by advertisement and it is loud .
symboli@@ sm is displaced .
artists have another pleasure and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like to let the viewer fall into the images , let them appear , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar &apos;s art . &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I am not paying attention to completely cap@@ turing the Bible , but rather choosing the topics that are important to him , including mysterious subjects .
&quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot;
for Hans M@@ √∂h@@ ler , Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for M@@ √∂h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as those of responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - Paper and Screen Wall Pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15th .
start of construction for BM@@ X train is near
plans were made , place was found , companies commissioned to model earth moun@@ ds for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track it was finished .
failures in politics and administration made supp@@ lication , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill@@ top dig@@ ging up , looking for new place - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the permission will come into being in October , the first common denom@@ in@@ ator Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck could now report in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still going to happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its engagement for refugees until 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga will set a clear sign on the weekend .
football respon@@ ds to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and ensures the policy its help in tackl@@ ing the problems that arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t concern me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he intends to intensi@@ fy the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the State Minister Mrs. √ñ@@ zo@@ ƒü@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly play a central role here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and will help .
but the decisive course must be the policy .
this is why the German Football Federation has expanded its &quot; 1 : 0 refugee initiative &quot; for four years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019 on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the fr@@ inge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 professional associations set a clear sign when they will bear the impression &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports editor Ru@@ di V√∂l@@ ler , the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes every one , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football clubs , no , we have to use our power , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
the national team of the women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the Euro Cup against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that all 36 licenses had started their own projects in their own locations was great .
it is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association is providing 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the German Federal Government of DF@@ B and the German Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : managing director of SAP losing an eye on accident
according to Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye through a fall in July .
in the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he had fallen on a water glass after midnight , which he wore in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he &apos;s almost bled , he was power@@ less , then tow@@ ed out to the street - that &apos;s what he told us so last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP Co @-@ Fo@@ under Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Pl@@ att@@ ner .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S√ºd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , fully in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to him it is important to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s important to get up again when you fell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a photograph and declared that he had suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore comes as little as a spare driver for the two Stam@@ bo@@ il@@ ots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in Singapore on the weekend , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ low point in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken .
the National Player will also be missing the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar in the Du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be back in the German Bundes@@ liga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen on Sunday , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load on its pro@@ s , Tu@@ chel will not only change its trunk position on the Re@@ us position .
thus he announced a change on the door@@ keeper position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes up the place of family @-@ based Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; he is training on an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion .
however , Tu@@ chel made it open whether it will be used in all European league games in the future .
with a high probability , he will also ride the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ sche statement by fellow player Re@@ us that the final suit for the BV@@ B should be the goal in the Europa League will keep Julian W@@ eig@@ l comprehensible for him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that , Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants to lead the way for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , envis@@ ages investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt , Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Frankfurt Motor Show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic jams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the ministry of transport stresses , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid increase in digital radio communication .
there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional risk of liability be brus@@ hed up &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to make sure that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is lifted from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the German government also wants to advoc@@ ate a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees man as a driver .
with automated driving , the car increasingly assumes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passengers .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economics , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways to 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less cars on public roads are expected to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far to 2020 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to about 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of passenger cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ √∂ren Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied .
but the Germans still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or American .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the Forum of the Forum of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the test organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will en@@ force in the next ten years , 32 percent reck@@ on only in 20 years with this , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France 21 percent of respon@@ dents estimate up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the US 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey by the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
at least 15 per cent of the traffic in flowing traffic could be seen on the motorway , 45 percent in traffic jams .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis
according to current state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art competition from 25 September to 4 October , D√ºsseldorf @-@ based D√ºsseldorf will only be able to open its doors in the individual .
the final decision should be made no later than September 22 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to catch the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ coach J√∂rg Ro@@ √ü@@ kopf in D√ºsseldorf during the course of the European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor appointment in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said single European leader Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remembered the European Championships 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Timo also was missing , and we have become European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should be guided by this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the fifth @-@ sixth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has made a serious injury to the right leg .
in the Champions League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , the defender was hit by a tac@@ kl@@ ing by H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment .
the first diagnosis interpreted the 20 @-@ year @-@ old fellow player from Bas@@ tian Schwein@@ itz to a sh@@ in .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an enf@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of very big fashion show and a wax figures gr@@ us@@ el@@ cabinet : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : window mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the enf@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation from September 18 , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his posture at the beginning of a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , he was on the contrary , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition rang a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely survi@@ ving work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built up , but it is a super@@ bly choreograph@@ ed overall art work , for which much expenditure was done : to fr@@ ori@@ ze the d@@ olls , for example , a Sty@@ list was engaged .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have ar@@ red 14 tons of material to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special delic@@ acy : a leather trousers outfit with a cor@@ set .
Madonna meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative , fashionable temp@@ tations of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught the design of fashion by himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought some of them .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry tip as a fashion niche
in the past , the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en were about to make a meter .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were produced in large quantities for customers , which they worked for example on blankets and she@@ ers .
this is no longer working alone today , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the pl@@ ums of P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , the fashion is again important .
fashion played a major role in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , and was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt called some examples : lace in jewelry , in accessories like bags and in regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects past styli@@ stic periods , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already have half of all orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with nine other companies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ lau@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a member of the Industry Association of P@@ lau@@ dry lace and embroi@@ dery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private specialist shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays the mass @-@ goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian area and are sold almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , exports are currently weak@@ ening , currently in Russia and the US .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the embroi@@ derer in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have been introducing a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt lectures at the branch office of the West@@ s√§ch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base .
some years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historical snow@@ ball tip .
in some places the machine is sti@@ cking up small spheres .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ en gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ √üe took his inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that I couldn &apos;t do anything with traditional pl@@ lau@@ dry lace &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex procedure it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says .
it also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in pl@@ ums and surroundings and who want to have a mem@@ ento .
I see my jewellery as the modern ambass@@ adors of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
legends are not supposed to touch , but Disney still dar@@ es a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it &apos;s not about a new movie , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first movie with the magical child girl .
it is about the experience of n@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director already stands firm : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
the economy has to open wide out@@ wards to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group tas@@ ked with steering the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
encouraging new start @-@ ups and promoting reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; X@@ i said .
the Leadership Group has adopted a set of guidelines including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified , which are not eligible for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of great importance since it as@@ signs a major role to the market in the allocation of resources , ensuring a legally owned business environment and making the market more open , said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
in the context of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the Green Card by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
the law of the lawyers to guarantee their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also attended Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double limit the level of mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to increase the dose of the neur@@ on to consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding job paper from the EU , critic@@ ised the plans sharply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and small children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; should be lifted from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury that , on the basis of the current limit values , about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ conceivable .
in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate the limit values of other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plo@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller peac@@ efulness @-@ fish , such as car@@ p usually are so low @-@ loaded , that they already comply with the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lowering of small @-@ scale mixes is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ gu@@ ous distra@@ ction which only helps the economy , &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mercury is a heavy @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal which is heavily enriched by the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; low quantities can cause damage to the nervous system particularly in the case of un@@ born damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on his homepage , the Federal Ministry of the Environment declares that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
mercury gets into the environment primarily through the burning of coal .
according to a written information forwarded by the Federal Ministry of the Environment , German coal @-@ fired power plants pay more than six tons of mercury per year , two @-@ thirds of the total population em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and across borders &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , European warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU &apos;s RA@@ S@@ FF warning system .
