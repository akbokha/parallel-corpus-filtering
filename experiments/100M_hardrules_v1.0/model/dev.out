Obama welcomes Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and T@@ eher@@ an dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but during the meeting , the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is den@@ ounc@@ ing Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and propos@@ ing Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
through the deal promoted by Obama around Iran &apos;s nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , which was partly considered to be an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech had not been discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected him with a reference to the election im@@ pending at that time in Israel .
in an emergency call Professor , his girlfriend shot to have shot
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ p@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to do it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school premises , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ sti@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that the university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency some@@ time later .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took his life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both of them taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised the Lamb , said he seemed too excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had earlier asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic way to an employment as an Assistant professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ ane Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , with 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he completed his doctorate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar play .
he was then the flock of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail rose three years ago both on a summer @-@ vintage .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter is writing and singing her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for different companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a B@@ ark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5 September last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica player in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the cleaning up and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of joke .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people participated in the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial service .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gi@@ l , while the Univers@@ ité &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now claimed that Lamb had made the emergency call after he had shot up Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call was called Pr@@ enti@@ ce as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael J. Fox ch@@ okes about his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Princess Diana &quot; &quot; &quot;
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Ro@@ y@@ als , and I realize that the seat is empty next to me , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated y@@ aw@@ ning and an arm length away from being with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected movie the@@ aters in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ Moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the conflict lasting almost five years , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN chief again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Britain and France - at the fr@@ inge of the meeting of Ministers of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tackl@@ ing the crisis in Syria , which they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 surveys that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand it as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans are trying to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks when asking them down , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ in@@ ating the real estate Mog@@ ul .
of course it is too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won only a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ um@@ ps stamina and start to drop their dollars to overthrow it .
here are some current survey points suggest@@ ing that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
tr@@ um@@ ps popularity values have turned around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters were happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing about enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the candidate of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans don &apos;t see Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of Irish voters think that the real estate Mog@@ ul has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the nation &apos;s first presidential state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they expose their hats , republi@@ can voters keep Tr@@ ump into real .
if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle four of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet it is evident that a large number of GO@@ P voters consider Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ support is distributed over more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support .
he points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump are saying that they have firmly entr@@ en@@ ched their voices .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say that never change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nonetheless Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump announced in his election campaign two months ago , immigrants from Mexico called &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse had been in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump &apos;s crucial His@@ pan@@ o Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ Survey of Monday , six of 10 Republi@@ cans tell that they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as the immigration remains in the spotlight , it will appear Donald Tr@@ ump .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
meanwhile , around half of the support of Republi@@ can voters is now accounted for by Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , above all because of their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry with Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in the Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell bent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany
the most expensive residence can be found here in the Hob@@ look@@ out Trail - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a roof@@ top house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations a square metre is the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential neighbor@@ hoods , however , a price such as Pe@@ an@@ uts occurs .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro - per square meter , well marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is , as an exception , not at the top .
Champions League : Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
two @-@ time scor@@ er in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for the FC Bayern to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympic Games Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
a sovereign op@@ ener of the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have given the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; Milano Mission . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her tac@@ tic in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9. ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth achievement in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run .
in his 28 hits in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s lead , Müller was rewarded with the help of the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who caused a kiss of the World Champion as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based audience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus has won his latest six home games in the qu@@ e@@ ens class , among them notable clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was also proud ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but in their aggressive efforts often too imagin@@ ative to works .
the attacks have often been initiated on the left side of Douglas Costa , which was rarely passed against former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller left more luck from the right than his flan@@ k hit from the right half @-@ field in the upper left corner of the tor@@ so .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympic @-@ Stor@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown beat the pole of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ked with the knee ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bav@@ arians pulled up their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to bet needle stit@@ ches .
but at Tor@@ hü@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er , however , there was forgiveness .
so about when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye about the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat outside at first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , said Sports Board Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to make something different is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Götz@@ e was late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , but Müller still had one on it .
before the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ ale in the stadium .
after a smaller group of mixed Bayern fans in their audience blo@@ c apparently provoked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and proc@@ eeded with pun@@ ches against the Munich adher@@ ents .
at least one Bavarian fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , har@@ ms not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : in case of ren@@ unciation , the risk sin@@ ks quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers have the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ Fa@@ che .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
tooth decay causes tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , the authors stress .
the link between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to more frequent gum infections in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks back to the level of qu@@ itting smoking , said the author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , Head of study H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and blood vessels and , according to our findings , results in a good dental health up to the high age .
in Germany more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness affected the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pins the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter rem@@ n@@ ants from the late Anti@@ quity on Cologne banks of the Rhine .
for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have dug up skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historic buildings near the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , said Museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are looking for so @-@ called ground monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always called as a department of archaeological excav@@ ation .
in the third construction section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , the archae@@ ologists were now found .
from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves that belonged to the church .
young woman caught by freight train
after a young woman is caught up at the station in mu@@ til@@ ene lin@@ ders , the Federal Police asks the people for help .
on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 pm the woman from the direction of the train station crossed the track and was captured by a freight train that came from the direction of Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
according to the Federal Police , she carried out he@@ avi@@ est injuries from the collection of the train .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
in order to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TT@@ IP ) , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes in its functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the responsible EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström on the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP addresses the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely stipul@@ ate that the EU states and the US will jointly choose independent judges for a new investment court .
they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time a second instance is planned .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
so far , the parties involved have agreed among themselves to arbit@@ ers , a claim to claim against their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work according to its own data to an international investment court .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) demanded above all by major corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , using the company to permit compensation for tax pay@@ ers , le@@ verage national laws , or to en@@ force a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act identified the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate .
it has been critic@@ ised above all that it should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German Economic State Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a major step forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission took significant points into account in the reform , the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European company B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the chances of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this .
when talks on the free trade agreement TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement was supposed to be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer unten@@ able .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sat on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart that the shy @-@ looking fol@@ ks@@ ler recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about various places he repeatedly records on the map , about his meticul@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they have ar@@ isen and what it looks like in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderfully creative person .
the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; published cle@@ ver@@ ly composed songs , which are harmonious very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into the great opul@@ ent opul@@ ent .
it is rum@@ oured that &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 U.S. states should be con@@ stru@@ ed as a result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already appeared and breaks down positively certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live is enough for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
over@@ bor@@ dering ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively of electronic spare parts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth neat studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but performed by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and rever@@ b .
since the smaller clubs have long gone out , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and big fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a band of five .
in the dark @-@ kept Hamburg More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are sitting in their chairs now , the clearly stri@@ ped St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
you hear from the audience : the talk is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can basically throw away the &quot; record . &quot;
only after an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens thank@@ ed mo@@ dest@@ ly , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally bows down under thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s quest
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s quest with tension is expected
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ y and for the first time put himself in with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to make the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after mid@@ day , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs from around the world .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary sc@@ rut@@ iny of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , as after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C convention on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , provoked cri@@ tique of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands at the heart of several news @-@ pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are referring to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported it as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; following Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation in profits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour proposed changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pension minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limitation of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23.@@ 000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader who has been T@@ ory Chief David Cameron since he has been over the Dis@@ patch Box during the last decade .
the Labour leader who promised another policy approach says that he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ l@@ ington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s questions are con@@ front and that it is subject to both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strike action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the stri@@ pe with opposition , and instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Angela Eagle that the shadow economies will represent him if he does not take part - for example when Mr Cameron is on the move abroad .
he also talked about the idea that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy show , &quot; which is often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s questions . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling and its leadership in the House of Parliament and its position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics argued they had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms .

pounds increased by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound immediately rose to data indicating an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid goal SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , the result without Bon@@ uses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and fastest on the date of an interest rate increase since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1.@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the world &apos;s two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again reported growth .
share of Gl@@ en@@ core increased by 5 % after the mining giant said that it took 2.5 billion $ by a stock sale as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the Shar@@ es of the Packaging and Paper Group Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his rating for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the cost could make the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber in the Capital : on Bie@@ ber expedition in Berlin
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young , a hand@@ ing with a top @-@ lay@@ ered flag crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the type with the plat@@ inum bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros heavy .
rather even more .
currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 turns through .
like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans es@@ cor@@ ted Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin &apos;s luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Bie@@ ber @-@ Bau : here you live i@@ dol , whose posters hang on in Sz@@ cz@@ ec@@ in , since Monday evening .
the suite in which the Canadian singer lives , costs the day exactly as much as her mother E@@ wa deserves in half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a should sit in the tenth class in the Gymnasium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fulfill her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory scho@@ oling ?
who does it che@@ at ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also Bie@@ ber itself does not .
this has already taken care of anyway .
for the advertisement in the promotional break of the Super@@ market , he cas@@ hed three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ple company put many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account .
and with every doll that looks like he goes and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber is also collecting .
when Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , one wonders at the window pane .
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e is too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; others stress that Bie@@ ber was finally just in the USA and Great Britain with his new single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on No. 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese idea to potato plan@@ ers idea
potatoes or twe@@ et@@ ers ?
it is both - in the potato dum@@ my , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ ant Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ ha@@ y has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had accidentally seen on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , in his shop , a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea joined the Leban@@ ese in the patent office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
how much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to betra@@ y .
only as much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds .
culinary international understanding is also good for its customers .
met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches Land Action Camp@@ aig@@ n to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di @-@ advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through the social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and store owners who sell che@@ ap@@ y tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September if the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment passes through its annual investor strategy ag .
there is much in the game since South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s I@@ GA network in East states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in East states .
however , analysts such as Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will s@@ nat@@ ch around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will take away from all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath von Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million sales per year and met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said that the loss in the food and food business and the amounts on met@@ cas@@ h@@ s high fixed cost base could cost some 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s revenues in food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2017 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade . met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Board of Directors of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ gas market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s &apos;s food and food trade , which has about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operating debt reduction in simultaneous printing on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to compensate for sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week and to deliver I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and providing a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s &apos;s chief executive Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging san@@ itation programs will grow to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise as a cri@@ tique for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ gios and deserves more praise for his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is repeatedly known as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight with the not@@ orious contest of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison called out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cr@@ amp bl@@ ended a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the sing@@ les behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty much more en@@ vious to is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the battle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost the US Open because of a cr@@ amp , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he is working very hard , and he has never had a problem with the other players , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gy@@ gios in the important decision making on Friday and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component into the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick has done very quickly to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency situation , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and ri@@ p@@ pled the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to get illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , as hundreds of migrants accum@@ ulate in a state of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indignation .
the people who fled from violence had stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter was ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police force . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ blo@@ c at a busy meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or from its neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency situation on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block streets and speed up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after it ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison guards were deployed at the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East into the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the upcoming economic refugees are , who are looking for a better life , and not war refugees , who claim protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany .
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) tall fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia for a crime . these laws also set higher prison terms for condemned human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament still needs to agree on the use of the military , expected next week , but Associated Press repor@@ ters have already seen heavy armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences under the new laws .
authorities are going to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials included two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wag@@ gon had arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounding the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and press a crowd to go there .
about 20 people were able to get involved , but thousands of people remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national pol@@ l
the former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her against the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ election ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is a candidate for the pres@@ idency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determining which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more resistant in their election than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored some profits .
Clinton has a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support among men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is only with 5 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a major advantage over the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead among the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a five @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some reservations and further 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are excited above all by her .
the views are more strongly mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters are saying that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters are also mentioned by Clinton &apos;s supporters ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permission to deal with the problems and the elec@@ torate are also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Vice President casts a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 % of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters are asked for elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the forefront . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than half of Clinton &apos;s supporters say that Bi@@ den would be far from S@@ anders their second choice .
if Bi@@ den decides not to qualify for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advance ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race .
as a candidate , fifty @-@ five percent of the voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; selectable &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call on the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters stands out as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics in voters of the pre @-@ election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities regard Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty in the three candidates while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion on it .
in general , democratic voters of the prim@@ aries also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office as Minister of Foreign Affairs continue to be asked , most demo@@ cra@@ cies of the pre @-@ election are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall .
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion has deterior@@ ated .
it is mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 % of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote see Tr@@ ump as well as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good grades in leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush successfully cut off hon@@ esty .
a majority sees S@@ anders as honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is located close to Donald Tr@@ ump at the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times
half of the voters &apos; support in the new pol@@ l has now been dropped to the two candidates .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received among demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell down at the lowest , with 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are at the third place .
the error margin at the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son climb@@ s in poll@@ s - with 19 % support in the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump before Car@@ son .
with a view of a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found a number of page thi@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even though peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean Sea is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even more warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people do not go into the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea in this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with it .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood loaded with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five persons are submitted .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood have brut@@ ally attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police .
officials said that he had been loaded with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a destination via a frozen field .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , polic@@ eman Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members of the Brotherhood started to hide and set up the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood on that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ sti@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning to his injuries .
following an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g repeatedly added injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs with bl@@ unt force .
&quot; too many families have been destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student has died in the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer representing the D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe made an accus@@ ation for the murder of the third rank for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of j@@ uri@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization which - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increase in interest comes , and the hous@@ et@@ ops will fall into stag@@ gering , yields for bonds will rise and the economy will slide into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance on the procedure .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
hence , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so sharply that investors should not focus on increasing interest rates , but rather on the period needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement might be exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean there will be no effects .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rates can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment enters , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency to accept net income from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a more recent study on what happened after interest rates of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market in the past 35 years is usually in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to an increase in income , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , published by Bob D@@ oll , chief plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares will tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return will start to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that it did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raises the question of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made an increase in the interest rate of the F@@ ed all year , and all eyes focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all the increase cycles from 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers very quickly put into the shadows after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le because the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic direction .
in bonds , the yields seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle occurs .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond di@@ ets are falling immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to returns between longer and shorter bond issues and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
it is interesting , says Jones that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has increased , the earnings curve is fl@@ atter , bor@@ rowing has expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed ag@@ grav@@ ates its strategy .
companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the United States will benefit from the benefit of rising interest rates and attrac@@ ting local products more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will get worse since an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and also finance their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equi@@ ties tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest raise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet out@@ performed companies with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital returns as well as low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their lower quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a major problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are how fast it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; du@@ mm@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also cited the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins picked up The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading Euro MP and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ish@@ able from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also cited the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously named examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC General Director rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial opponents when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 I won &apos;t learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder work must be done to engage the audience than it did in the past , because the British were less informed of classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins picked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was &quot; produced in a special BBC fashion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the next time a series of entertainment stops . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to issue fees for other entertainment formats .
net sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down the issues in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has been dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say that there are now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been evolving over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do it in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is sw@@ inging , and we will possibly experience that growth will decrease .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers with@@ hold their purchases from this event , which takes place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers attracted their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some dealer websites plum@@ met@@ ed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 spent a little more than £ 1 online .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims bury the killed in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first funeral par@@ l@@ ors in Mec@@ ca .
Saudi Arabia partly puts a burden on the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed to Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
mour@@ ners filled , extensively dressed in white , the route to pay their respect when the first of the dead entered their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the mour@@ ning proc@@ ession passed over to the Holy Place , where only days previously a building crane was rus@@ hing through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed@@ side .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king suspended a sanc@@ tion over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 people who were killed when a crane pl@@ ung@@ ed through the Great Central Bro@@ ch@@ ee of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead there was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane fell down .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group would not have stopped the crane &apos;s arm when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree issued by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad would be prohibited .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man praised what caused the overthrow of the crane , which rus@@ hed into an inner courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which took place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group for not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi family of Saudi Arabia for decades and has taken over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a tr@@ un@@ ned son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s .
the wre@@ ck of the crane arrived in the midst of heavy winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) are to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanent injured .
other publishers will receive half of this amount .

by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Br@@ its put down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out work in their homes
if you sk@@ ill@@ fully handle a hammer or brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
the British are increasingly employing professional tra@@ des@@ people to perform DIY jobs in their homes , such as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new CEO of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices is now out@@ dated .
King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by women .
at the moment , the men predomin@@ ate .
she said it was necessary to face growing demographic trends that show more female single households who do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said , &quot; There is still a majority of men in our stores .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this more strongly to a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women in the UK &apos;s FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her posted a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group owed the cost of closing the stores .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ president A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ for@@ estation .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of mis@@ use .
from this alleg@@ ation , he was legally acqu@@ itted in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ end@@ ants had funds from association accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , via which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials are also accused of financial collapse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was eliminated by the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
in the event of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that there was not an asset in the association at any time .
the sports officials only had compens@@ ations for expense allowance and the sports club , for whom they had spent a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the Pas@@ si@@ va was bet@@ ting approximately 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we were standing before the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the def@@ end@@ ants told the large @-@ scale audi@@ tor of the Finance Office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , our life insurance policies have been laid down as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in advance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , it is not allowed to make any debts .
furthermore , with corresponding financial success , the withdrawal of the expense allowance has been retro@@ actively decided until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely in 2003 , when a plus had been in the account .
therefore , l@@ ump sum and not detailed bookings appeared , the former chairman explained the processes .
the two accused managed to split accounts and austerity books , said the second def@@ end@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed to the association in detail , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in the details of financial statements , important to the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
that would have been set@@ backs , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and was not known to the association according to its testimony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the association .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor represented in the room .
the co @-@ accused was informed , justified the function@@ ary .
this bank transfer was formulated as &quot; claim re@@ asser@@ tion . &quot;
why compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
wher@@ eu@@ pon the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never suffered a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never had a c@@ ents salary , he merely calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
at di@@ ets he was charged EUR 1,000 per month , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the def@@ end@@ ants were unable to show accurate documents for the early years .
they were no longer stored after an audit in which everything had been judged correctly .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second def@@ end@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the exercises were made in cash , with which he had to drive from his place of residence to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained in his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trial will continue on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard show@@ cases more 30,000 jobs
in addition to the personnel cuts that have been running for three years , the computer will depend on further jobs at the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up .
there is no end to the job car@@ eers at the US @-@ computer terri@@ fic Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the breakdown of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
this will save costs of US $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , divided the company on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will start from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 50@@ 5,000 jobs that have been running for three years has not yet been completed .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Share ( Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ) share came to 2.3 percent .
the company , which is grown up with printers from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto , currently spl@@ its into a new company , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock market .
another dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services continued to replace the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to nearly 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
as a result , the proceeds went back to 15 of 16 quarters .
HP answers the changes in the industry with a spl@@ itting up and massive job cuts .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has recently re@@ acted that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and buying more and more stores right now .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
but a direct participation of German soldiers to combat hand@@ outs in Iraq would primarily lead to rejection : 54 per cent opposed it , 35 percent expressed their approval .
the fact that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
24 percent are opposed to intervene in the conflict .
in collaboration with Syrian authorities , Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of respon@@ dents declined 20 per cent .
29 percent did not decide .

the focus of the fair is on the 27th of September connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro@@ mobility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two days of press conference , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ head@@ lights against several hundred abandoned refugees at the Serbian border .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the breach of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line was formed , and behind the police officers stood a search@@ light .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially stopped the pepper spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now res@@ ig@@ ned somewhat .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas were crying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other refugees pi@@ ped together and suffered from short@@ ness of breath . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves when the U.S. bank@@ note comes together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday , to make the most important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates at the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will keep .
it is a historical event because it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest set on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , Head of Staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ sty outlook on global circumstances .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the indications point out that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 8.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death Prot@@ ector at Delta State University leave behind ap@@ ologies
after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted to &quot; make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social scientific education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning
and he said that he had shot on a man , and he was put to death .
Lamb said to the staff of the emergency call centre that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
as police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could und@@ o it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ er had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triangle relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said that they were married about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter 19 is , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that I called up relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville in that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in spring 2015 , such as his CV on the University &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett because of cancer .
the actor was alleged to have been struggling with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this is certainly challenging his tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group remo@@ del@@ ing .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros per year with a better organization alone .
around 150 executives around the world will cost the workplace .
however , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and equi@@ val@@ ents the cheaper Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of real@@ ignment is a profit contribution of around € 500 million per year in cost and revenue syner@@ gies , shared the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no longer a board for the passenger &apos;s business in the future .
the airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the management team headed by Chef Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the future .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees was highly complex .
the airlines operate under the roof of the airline group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict of collective bar@@ gaining with the pilot association Cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations will be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the strike stopped .
that shared the union with .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement schemes for pilots .

the conflict between the union and the airline led to various strikes in recent months .
in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is &quot; Wings . &quot;

Manchester United &apos;s Luke Sha@@ w cannot play for months because of double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg during the Manchester Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought the left out@@ ward defender to tears and will exclude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season again .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double blow @-@ up and is located in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then playing fantas@@ tically , and then it happens .
in the locker room he had a oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a Red Card and the Sus@@ pension of a El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian ump@@ ire had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a mo@@ m and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery now begins , I come back more strongly . &quot;

the UK distributor has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming of June .
Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a broken leg when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Dutch team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad at it . I &apos;m so sorry .

surely David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a matter which all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost mem@@ orized .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the prime minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental label published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read to my children , because there seems to be always a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the story of the book , instead re@@ stores a summary of the 2012 movie version that added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature went and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; read . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that were not yet suspi@@ cious : the text presented by Cameron is partially like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , Cameron seems unlikely to be so familiar with the story of the book . here an un@@ named boy sounds like the local environment through the gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ tering , thin @-@ kn@@ itting on@@ ce @-@ ler , despite the protests of the name of the name of the trees , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax twice a year after a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ oon &apos;s employees , but there were no other immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batch setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear any sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
this news : Adam Ly@@ th leaves the UK test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse .
with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented to results .
there were no question marks with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination because - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , the run of Ly@@ th could have been extended , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully kno@@ cks out more of Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude even if he did not perform such good performances , and that does not surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test strike receives to place its mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that could be raised was that England first started Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he is a drummer , whom I set up highly .
he is an X factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same odds as those before him , but this naturally depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of propos@@ ing Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra @-@ spin punch and four squ@@ e@@ aks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a cri@@ cket player &apos;s Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l .
Mo@@ een maybe did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s number 3 for her , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined the Open@@ er in 2001 .
he made three hundred sheep right away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited use with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spins that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made some clever additions to the training staff .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful insert into the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can profit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing room , even if the messages are in line with the previously predicted .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but coaches and team leaders do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy of heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain Zul@@ u if the economy is in a lau@@ ts by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ finished ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of genius Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought viol@@ ently because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend said recently that some member states are so deeply mired in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from their own guilt , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disturbing contract changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze social protection .
we could call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves before a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European boy@@ friend , looking for an out@@ sider Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials came to the point where they no matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her as it has happened with the exagger@@ ated long out@@ liers such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French President François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that they will get a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s leaving from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
so possibly some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how rob@@ ber@@ ically the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense , and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one as they did during the referendum , inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can feel weak at Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Stra@@ i@@ ght ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s .
in all his ma@@ dness Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sh@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ In@@ dies who own most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her but noted that if you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , as Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly l@@ aps on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needed time for me - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ year @-@ old , an error at that time and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional blue @-@ off @-@ tendency and the wild Gef@@ il@@ ds of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow campaig@@ ners and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to hold lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in accordance with their Benn@@ ite reference business , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all , to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday by something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called .
experts critici@@ ze Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less damaging than smoking came from a meeting of 12 persons , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health UK ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Ans@@ wer Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) in order to conduct their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing , which he should have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , added them .
the reasons for choosing the members of the committee are not supplied , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting , the tobacco management of P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research work is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be@@ zeich@@ ung @-@ wise &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prof. Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims have already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence is proof and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
through the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC ought to give up East@@ bourne , says former boss of Channel 4
the former leader of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ward and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should be used only to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK stations .
he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ it@@ ters like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC General Director Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sends , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I do not consider in the medium or long term for a good idea , one should at least concentrate its production on programs which others do not make or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax finan@@ ces programs that could be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ward is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to see how this is to be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , led channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s fault in the hunt for reviews is &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular shows are what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , presented in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ bourne would sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue that if they go to their hypo@@ critical missions for justi@@ fying 4 billion pounds of broadcast fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has ever seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you all think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who have a lot of money for the 150 pounds , I wonder if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 CEO David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , requested that the BBC should check its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain &quot; in public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
to the question of partnerships El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television are shown , and with the commercial broadcasting Alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetic &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by break@@ outs of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in which they reson@@ ate with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work through switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetic where ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep @-@ brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread@@ worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed motor neur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetic could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which needs to be sent down to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ onic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily disable the cited human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are visible at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look .
&quot; important Anno@@ unc@@ ements : from 15th to 18th September with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( D@@ ock@@ lands Light Railway ) , one reads in the font types of the London Under@@ ground and the trademark of the DL@@ R line that turns into the image of a tank .
in September there will be a s@@ warm of arms dealers with the DL@@ R ... customers are asked to help at the stop of the fair .
the 300 posters are designed by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cru@@ el Design in Ban@@ sys D@@ ism@@ aland .
a collective entitled Special Pat@@ rol Group helped in the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a £ 6 pack of Allen keys that claimed to &quot; gain access to around one @-@ third of the bus stops on the planet . &quot;

one of the par@@ o@@ dy displays produced by Special Pat@@ rol Group .
according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ in@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside galleries .
many artists deal with activists within protest movements to work and realize that they have to go outside into the real world , so that their art has an influence on society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters is greeting commuters in the subway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Am@@ ne@@ sty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works for free with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist who works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that was around advertising for the trade fair - through a laying of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic tender advertising slogan , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ish with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a drop in the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our front door .
perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors will f@@ end fantas@@ tically eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old I moved into a student residence , still in the belief in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residence ranges from slightly nerve wra@@ cking to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to talk : people tell where you come from , where and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ax where you are standing in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burned and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people leave .
the rooms of people are often transformed into beverages recipes , film night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress up and bre@@ w their under@@ wear .
referring to this : don &apos;t remember to start a relationship with the university
intro@@ vert receives a rough treatment at the university .
their room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love you and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I used to interact with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by soci@@ alizing - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of speaking : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a non @-@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
make friends through baking .
as you begin the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck at the doors of people to imagine themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less odd than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I did bake something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel committed to talking and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poor@@ ly mixed cl@@ ots of flour , sugar and fat cause people to fall asleep when they kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop sp@@ le@@ en for your tea too ?
check that with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a rinse aid to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if it makes them feel a little bit qui@@ eter than three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even lou@@ der music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly let their neighbors sleep for two hours before leaving their own music , shut down their door and went to their three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be aw@@ k@@ ward embarrass@@ ing if you have a room@@ mate for your future spouse to take care of her , dis@@ connect and then see her every day and perhaps see how she passes all together friends to her ?
of course , the heart goes through its own ways - but if a hot co @-@ dw@@ eller is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an el@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good bar@@ gain is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
shut down your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you put in the freezer - but t@@ ack@@ ers their possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
town@@ houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , t@@ anning agents
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner is building row houses for people in Central Fran@@ con@@ ia for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the single mother and the t@@ anner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to get cheap and well @-@ built today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how fast favorable living space can be created : he builds in a project row houses for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain in a large part here .
in view of the stream of refugees , we also need sufficient living space over the next few decades .
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution .
guil@@ d : a terra@@ ced house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
that is different when people are accommod@@ ated in blocks of living .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it is again peace , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ d : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building instructions complicated their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guil@@ d : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have correctly gone through my project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially complicated , it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the set @-@ up regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under construction , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is lack of space .
refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
guil@@ d : there were those who accused me of creating luxury structures for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely is not right .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : over the past five years , we had a building boom in Germany , but we built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees but also the single mother or the t@@ anner .
I &apos;ll show you how to build better and well today .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to do so by linking updates . similarly , it will be easier to do so when using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone possibly switches to half way and this could lead to a break@@ out of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second stressed before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the vice @-@ champion before the race in Singapore on this Sunday by title defender and double champion Hamilton .

whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Chess Club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , which was founded three months ago , has recorded another member in its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1 . class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation , which Chairman Alfred Klein met .
this makes it possible to record players who cannot record the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; is seen as an expression of his clos@@ eness with the spa town .
district Office is looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the geri@@ at@@ ric centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have merged under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consultations , you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more specifically to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , right next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors will receive information on questions such as nursing care or services of health care and care funds .
for many years we have been working with our out@@ patient care service that often car@@ egi@@ vers are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , many services of the insur@@ ances are not rarely taken up because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new owner J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amb@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; service for the administrative service of the elderly and the hospital and for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment can be used .
the offers from the sen@@ iors Centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior center for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is particularly evident in demographic change .
because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future essential .
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the simil@@ ation at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able fellowship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the social foundation is making a big contribution to ensuring that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 o &apos;clock , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Satur@@ days from 10 am to 12 pm .

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang passed 92 years of age
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus announced on Tuesday .
M@@ ang gave the Künstler@@ haus an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was said in the broadcast .
born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the 1980s , he was commissioned to set up the Treas@@ ury chamber at the Hof@@ burg in Vienna and the reconstruction of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum .

according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass over the past two years .
he did not intellec@@ tually agree .
Wiese was cut off the ha@@ irs in Bremen &apos;s inner city when he saw a parking spac@@ er standing outside for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
after that , Wiese rus@@ hed out of the shop , insul@@ ted the officials and accused her of the mis@@ si@@ veness of his feet , as reported by the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper .
in the city of Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations , but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it from the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

men beating 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses seek the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 PM , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft filling station .
there were also three persons on the grounds of the gas station .
one of these men cried out to the young people and struck them with their f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ breaking @-@ break and bleeding strongly from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ st@@ ened and appe@@ aled to the but@@ cher , he first dismissed from his sacrifice .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their home and passed there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the car anymore , the injured went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
with the help of a stroke , one examined the victim &apos;s face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
up to now there is only one vag@@ ue description of the activity .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 metres tall and was dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and instructions to report on the phone number 06@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller acqu@@ ires practice in the field of fel@@ lows and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ st U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of fel@@ lows on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his side in the next few months .
after a conversion phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when Frank Müller and his wife met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who are currently completing their professional training at the Ver@@ dener Hospital and who also wants to go into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the Müll@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel fel@@ lows and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I just ph@@ oned them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea of running his own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the mill@@ ers bought the house with practice .
however , they will continue to live in break@@ age @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller was also raised there , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several doctor &apos;s offices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as a senior physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and engaged in voluntary work in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness for Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ris@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a general practitioner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the renovation the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the computer is completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of € 50,000 is given to the mill@@ er as part of a subsi@@ dy programme of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sard@@ ar Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come to the field of Fel@@ ris@@ ausen every quarter , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
there is another doctor &apos;s office in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor would have found it , it would have gone too .
who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hours , by the way , also looks above all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms .
with their f@@ arewell to A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows rec@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she felt a little melanch@@ oly after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live further in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients quite often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also lifted up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to submit a request for asylum can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be able to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear also that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel to Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
that is how the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia was already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to limit its borders to refugees but not to abri@@ dge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government ha@@ st@@ ened , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to leave the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia in order to ev@@ ade the registration .
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the nearby ma@@ ize fields .
according to local media , police vehicles are constantly meeting new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with about 4000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ oj@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , would diver@@ t Croatia and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was the way people approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , but in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been on the road all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border that was about 500 kilometres away from Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has done so , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could lead to a postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive limits to border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister Ost@@ oj@@ ic had under@@ lined that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not mention details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 . since then , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony concerning the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees continue to be stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday early on a local note in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be about very high refugee numbers at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already started distributing maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the information captured , in@@ sider deals are to be made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce assisted with this action to its 20th anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went to the city and people with the action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is available to the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions as voluntary workers .
while some people spontaneously grab the chal@@ k and &quot; be@@ vel my life , &quot; &quot; you can read , &quot; &quot; stop war &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t suffer for long , &quot; others stay short , read , say sentences such as &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again , there are little discussions about the action , about life , dealing with the dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Mannheim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ ak@@ onian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work , which , together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband , is the carrier of ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why this public @-@ effective action was good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the fact that not everyone wants to express himself publicly , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supplier giant lowered its earnings outlook for an entire year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. claimed to earn a win between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecasts .
analysts expected a fac@@ t@@ set of 10,@@ 84 $ according to a survey .
the lower prospect will be achieved despite the price increases , which will be 4.@@ 9 percent on average and will be effective on January 4 and despite higher sur@@ charges for heavy and large packages that will be collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result was increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and because of growth in online stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company yields &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid yields &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; considering the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global commerce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of the rival UPS , which plans to dis@@ continue 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which were predicted by T@@ acks Investment Research &apos;s twelve analysts .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks questioned analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has seen a decline in international priority shipment in recent years , which resulted in sales in its unit Express shipment to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while earnings declined due to higher labour costs in freight business .
in the pre@@ market trade , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is im@@ min@@ ent against them at the end of the two @-@ storey residence hall .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other matters .
the Central Bank has a double order from Congress : keeping US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive by the short @-@ term interest rate at short term since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ences on the global financial markets might be anxi@@ ous to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal government bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue waiting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which in itself sec@@ ures the financial market .
about half of econom@@ ists recently surv@@ eyed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that indicates a 30 % chance for an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed raises the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts l@@ essen the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage was umped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence during this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty as to when the F@@ ed would act .
one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow intensi@@ fication of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence expected .
although job creation slow@@ ed down in August , improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world added to the end of the month , after China had depreci@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value declined by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat this month , with the D@@ ow now almost 10 % below the High of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation when the interest rate should be increased .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred over the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US National Bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in the decision making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Administration has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its monetary expansion , spark@@ ed confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect that they not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
co@@ ater , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to an increase in interest , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its body by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limit@@ less noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ner .
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives cancelled these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability to the first place only during a severe crisis such as the market collapse in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for Inter@@ est Sett@@ lement of the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Li@@ fest@@ y@@ les for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support non @-@ profit asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 lic@@ ences .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er home at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , the whole of other classes is at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande fav@@ ours nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women about how important good food is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that su@@ ck at breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should do .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the EUR 2.3 million sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat for solar installations .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ around in the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ campus is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council meeting , the elabor@@ ated building application has been unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the committee decided , among other things , an application for a legal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resp@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was permission for a special form regarding the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gab@@ led roof with non @-@ mit@@ er first and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be built . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; this brings us together a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again the roof inclin@@ ation , which for energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan - should be below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan of cultivation ad@@ mits no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning the roof @-@ tilt , whereby the Council of the Council usually leaves more restric@@ tively on liber@@ ating jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is not a recurring project for turn@@ around building : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the congregation and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost of costs .
supplements are expected from school and width sports promotion .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the Land@@ rats@@ amt for testing .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station as well as the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed Land@@ rä@@ tin Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the Supervisory Board conven@@ es on Wednesday 23 September .
if plans are implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing internal station .
the rooms are available .
employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change is triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who to follow the succession , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the leadership from October 1 and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the In@@ ner Station .
for the next two years fisher@@ man with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees , will lead both houses , until next year the former hospital of the pop@@ lar , which has more than 35 beds , is to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refur@@ bish@@ ment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
Land@@ rä@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal government , is to be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I conclude that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß was not able to say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer on the Qu@@ asi move to Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened with closure in recent decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are required tonight ( 8.@@ 15 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ ische HC .
although the league leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no reason for arro@@ gan@@ ce .
during the last season , the bad@@ ener had a painful defeat in Bh@@ c and got something good there .
hun@@ ted with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a ma@@ ize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hun@@ ts@@ men were in use as the police announced .
after a shot an 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were put into hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the det@@ ective police were determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
one of the susp@@ ects has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ ses of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate for the funeral of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old .
in the inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing for Saturday , has fallen victim to a crime of violence .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police announced on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was arrested on Tuesday evening , was also considered to be active and the investig@@ ators were in charge of the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after they did not come home after a visit to a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
when searching for the young woman , investig@@ ators first came to the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the case of inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tance of the extre@@ mi@@ sts , a crime was finally found against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee told the authorities to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ ses in the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be presented to the fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead .
information on the near@@ er circumstances of the act should bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
even more and more refugees are looking for a affordable residence .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and j@@ ob@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with income @-@ poor citizens around the last affordable housing .
to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are completed in Germany this year .
this means that 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation .
many come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a housing deficit that gets bigger from year to year .
currently , some 77@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study .
for this reason , many people in large cities were living in large cities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the f@@ lau@@ ts on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has sun@@ k for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er Wohn@@ bau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incentives should revi@@ ve social housing construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could be wai@@ ved for the value added tax and the land tax for subsidi@@ zed apartments will be suspended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , attractive tax amor@@ tis@@ ation possibilities are necessary according to the alliance .
the subsi@@ dy programme for refugee shel@@ ters in the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and communities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros had been rec@@ alled on Monday evening at 184 million euros .
now the project could be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor
after Hungary there is practically no going through anymore , there are more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia .
Zagreb canc@@ els the transit across Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous anyway .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Slovenian Minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ oj@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
the EU country in Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the exp@@ ul@@ sion of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have broken off to Croatia in order to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television broad@@ ca@@ ster RT@@ L reports .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , practically render superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through , and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia .
most of the media reports have been reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus and taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately upon arrival , they would have tried to walk on foot across the green border to Croatia .
while at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees do not come across a border fence .
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 90@@ s .
mine clean@@ ers should now quickly create a secure passage .
in Hungary , however , after the closure of the border there are hardly any more refugees .
on Tuesday , the police included 3@@ 66 human traffi@@ cked persons .
shortly before closing on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws en@@ force the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 trials were therefore initiated .
the convic@@ ted thre@@ aten prison sentences of up to five years and deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly issued &quot; transit zones &quot; - almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees would have stopped there .
practically no one has a prospect of obtaining asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the asylum seek@@ ers rejected are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the road@@ side in the past weeks .
the barriers were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps at the boundary was rebuilt .
no one wanted to comment on the purpose of this remo@@ del@@ ing .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
however , around 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government data .
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Brück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday we were busy with the cleaning up , when suddenly ten people stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly set off rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the stu@@ ds along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
previously we first ta@@ sted the unexpected guests , with snacks and drinks .
we said straight away , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE into a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u , after the announcement that the railway traffic was dis@@ continued in Germany , but still attempting to cross the border .
the regional train was shut down at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday is soci@@ able , on the day before a two @-@ brid@@ ge@@ run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately to establish structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has moved highly officially and publicly the attitude of the Hungarian government to the dun@@ n@@ age of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
leaders of this policy are not only the Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chao@@ tic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which she has invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge in the face of the ongoing flood of refugees and the approaching winter to produce decent conditions for protection @-@ seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad looking for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ solid quarters
Konrad has all hands to do with the spreading of refugees .
Christian Konrad is accustomed to his word weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks to place quarters for thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chaos at the first training centre in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the placing of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without great confusion , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a demand of 8@@ 5,000 in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5.000 accommodation units will have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 should provide the federal states , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial captains .
they would have assured him to create lod@@ g@@ ings for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it is good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to clarify how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum @-@ coordinator puts great expectations in the ORF campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency it could not be that districts must comply with a certain amount of the towel rack or the size of the upper duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , that he was successful in placing an accommodation , Konrad founded his experience .
I am an elderly gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without another into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood .
persu@@ asive power is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not charge the Republic as they stated .
their number of employees want to increase them to three to four .
up to now , his own quest for lod@@ g@@ ings has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the approval .
Linz demand a better distribution
for the time being no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at present , as the persons affected can currently be accommod@@ ated without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites should be tested for their suitability .
the principal officer critic@@ ises the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a long conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has corro@@ bor@@ ated the further procedure in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er ass@@ ures me that the German borders are not sealed .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will not be given any more .
however , the guards would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that Austria is now introducing checks on its borders is a logical consequence of the action of the Germans for P@@ ühr@@ inger .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general restoration of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industry line is officially concluded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT company S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in startup companies in the new ship@@ yard and later acquiring them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
€ 1.7 million was invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are en@@ quiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
actually J@@ utta has wanted to get a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : finally , she has now grown in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la Shop , opposite the shop in which it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies &quot; hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets amounting to 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have thought for a long time whether I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region of Linz selling this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots .
her fashion interest has gotten rid of her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I share most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture can &apos;t answer the professional lady with l@@ ately security .
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag uses every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose residents are called investors .
some people also associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether it is alien@@ ated , journalists are concerned or gaps in knowledge are revealed in international crisis politics - the candidate for the US presidential office whi@@ r@@ ls up the election campaign power@@ fully .
and cut off well .
this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the hair@@ dresser is a concept for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road .
some in the 1200 inhabitants place is related to it over -@@ nin@@ ety corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed a am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous sho@@ ots , to which besides Tr@@ ump also includes the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to the word &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tends to think that Tr@@ ump is &quot; a bit a big mau@@ l &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within the radius , was &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - to Hoch@@ deutsch : the l@@ ender , she says .
thus Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the l@@ ender .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a pub for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corner@@ stone of the real estate group were first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to home in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once cut off without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for P@@ relate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a boundary wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the reverse , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement sees the American rather dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so rising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the family Heinz donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing in the US at the time of his grandfather were like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; my president isn &apos;t it , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , which was viewed for a long time for the Tr@@ ump , has seen 12 000 cin@@ emat@@ ograph@@ ers , also in the USA a@@ wo@@ ken interest .
the Upper Bavarian congregation of Ram@@ sau in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf . &quot;
from the hands of the Vice President at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in neighbouring countries , the Swiss Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hur@@ ry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the Today &apos;s reviews .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sunrise , with the hosts David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , set up in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programs , including Dubai , New York , Niag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers since Sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators in the five main cities compared to the today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number lag@@ ged behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today has closed the gap to Sunrise in the last few months .
in August Today , Today reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up to now in September , Sunrise has an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ .000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these Mor@@ ning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle on New Zealand with his two children , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and struck easily The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL famili@@ y ( 7@@ 26@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , showed an average 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour was 7@@ 20,000 .
hot Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ lap the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may unknow@@ ingly have evi@@ dently knew who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , when Sam Wood eventually lands in The Bachelor , was wrapped up in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows next day , before going out of three two , you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips firmly closed until the final on Thursday
all three women have left in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last rose &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; her answers may become the game @-@ destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly named - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought it throughout the course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so fun to work with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well @-@ suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; could be One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now subject to it without reservation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be aired on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on Ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the ban@@ ker when he lost a lo@@ op@@ hole , as did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League @-@ Con@@ vert at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his desp@@ ised catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , who was restored in the first game quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian gam@@ es@@ hip had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut at that time in 2007 when a pass was leading to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
overall , it was still a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

free voters are demanding the recruitment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn r@@ ink in Groß@@ gel@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; otherwise we will get awards in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the State Parliament &apos;s parliament in parliament conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e .
actually , quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free elec@@ torate @-@ meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the exam , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , as existed during the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ tor boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one free voters as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative dishes that are responsible for asylum applications : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W chief critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform federal standards for federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police shot rubber stories in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , leader of the district officials , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , throwing stones and incen@@ diary bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then poured into the air before they res@@ or@@ ted to rubber stories .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber stories used , which are known to be able to kill , but which are traditionally used as a less mortal alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the T@@ arus , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been governed centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mandu and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post shall be restored .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
a mix of trade , trade and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market around 4000 square meters of land in direct vicinity to the Old Post Youth Centre .
the preparations for this are underway .
the plan is to use the premises for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
you wait for appropriate offers , it is called by the city .
which investor would question , be not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts were concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner of Große Straße , already a few months ago and the buildings on it were demoli@@ shed .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the holiday res@@ ett@@ lement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the Investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
a number of residents are still worried - they fear the end of their leisure activities
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months had been negotiated behind closed doors , s@@ lit , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now there are plans for a new holiday res@@ ett@@ lement near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der Company &quot; System @-@ Building , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the urban development committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ase went on the offensive from the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to meet all the rum@@ ours right now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in the discussion for months .
violent reactions among sea bu@@ den@@ ers who had come to the meeting called for the pictures and new details about the hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the board and member of the board at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ gli@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant leap over@@ looked by all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like some other project critics that the traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whole bus@@ loads must come to expect that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is happening on the well one hectare area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the development plans were still variable .

Google launches Dou@@ bling Don@@ ation Camp@@ aig@@ n to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( Google , O ) announced a dou@@ bling Don@@ ation Camp@@ aig@@ n which aims to raise 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ tax@@ ed the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the Don@@ ation call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled from Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark web and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery may be helpful for obes@@ e diabe@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new trial .
it is still too early to say whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after losing weight surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years obesity has proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are overweight with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity @-@ surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach ul@@ cer formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I under those who underwent this surgery sank from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at the age of 29 .
among those undergoing surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disorder was completely dissolved and 28 % in total .
in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison with diabetes , diabetes was completely only one percent and partly with only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol levels were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also supervised the blood glucose level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level fell by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the Senior researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team compared also average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rek@@ tom@@ ie Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger responses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study showed no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years , compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I below 35 interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long to take people seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is a topic that is currently being noticed in the fiction of fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story the novel should be interesting especially for Hun@@ sr@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe cannot accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East would lie .
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be confronted with the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and turned out that the violent reaction of the United States drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I told him that the way to resolve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
poison control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years who swal@@ low alcoholic hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such that Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of recei@@ pts of hand dis@@ infection products in children under 12 years of age who report toxins were reported from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go to the emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said some children drinking dis@@ infection products intentionally , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ing among the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink dis@@ infection products only because of a cheap experience .
young people have supposedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent , which are very attractive for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol .
a few sp@@ atter can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation especially for small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the emergency emergency centre at the hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come from it , it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ ja Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es of straw@@ berry fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was put into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered dr@@ unken in an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah lied to her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma as the girl had fallen through alcohol and hit his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ infection books and to store hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing anti @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health officials suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the New York State planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by expos@@ ing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the failed plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ät@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
in the event of a rear @-@ end collision on the cross p@@ inc@@ ts between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and Her@@ es , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old driver was easily injured during a rear @-@ end collision .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove towards the industrial area in the direction of the round@@ about and noticed too late that two preceding vehicles had stopped at the round@@ about .
as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck in the rear of an audi@@ tor and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fi@@ esta standing before .
in the accident involved vehicles , there was a damage of about 10,000 euros , dividing the police .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready and had to be tow@@ ed .

there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Cel@@ tic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . he insist@@ ed that he and his team mates are not under increased control , as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;re under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers middle @-@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here speak not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Cel@@ tic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now with a five point lead , clearly stood at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic already had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this just like that - but we have to go on .
we really need to really support Cel@@ tic because that makes the player better .
standing together is so important .

the players who come in summer have this pre @-@ season period to integrate what you have seen with our own group during this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ le
the Im@@ proved Hi@@ bee was re@@ proved after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive lyrics about Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts players Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the storm and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ k@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Cel@@ tic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s Management Board still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but it is true that the decline in the field must end .
I think that Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the boys back on track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ In@@ nes &apos;s happy to win against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ attractive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ In@@ nes ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ tions in order to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them ahead of five points ahead of Cel@@ tic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ In@@ nes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or songs that have not won games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , as it increases overall in the UK .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July in 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as figures from the Bureau for National Statistics ( O@@ NS ) showed .
meanwhile employment in Scotland fell 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken distur@@ bs the process
since the security staff was not able to satisfy the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the officials could take the stur@@ geon in custody .
a breath alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0,@@ 89 per mil@@ le .

why I &apos;m witness@@ ing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later , except for late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed through the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and since more applications are available as places , a mac@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you get access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have been better &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to enter all details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he persu@@ aded the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt of a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , only a few meters away from a police officer trying to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a house peac@@ eke@@ eping incident in Becken@@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape in the direction of the C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
champion football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , cous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that Racing Victoria &apos;s ste@@ wards tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they performed a personal campaign against him with L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt tu@@ ft rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the sp@@ ying accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes one re@@ acts and one has to live with the consequences , and I must live with that which I said .
tonight I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
before M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ing .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the view that it will be personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking outside that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and leave me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it .
but I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ stration levels of the trainer have developed with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he said that he could &quot; cast his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation for the Open Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; laugh@@ able &quot; after a package of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it would have been that way yesterday the whole day , which was so .
but it also had so on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one is too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy defe@@ ats ri@@ vals due to conten@@ tions for ring fighting
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda setting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm players &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a hardly disgu@@ ised note to the Storm team after his team achieved final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the stap@@ le of his team and said that they were only focused on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Tac@@ kl@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team gr@@ ati@@ fied him confi@@ dently , because they were worried that they were worried to be beaten by the storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows up again and again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring fights , when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything to our def@@ en@@ sive system or techniques throughout the year . but over the past six weeks , we have made our contact at Tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus , and this has provided us with the trend revers@@ al .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny how this shows up again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy had attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons had won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was comparing his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses and no points something exciting ?
for me , it is the maps .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the storm team released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ou@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night in the atri@@ um at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
$ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee Payment after Drug Ad@@ dress
a man potentially threatened with a lifel@@ ong penalty for his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested in the last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America to Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no proof that he tried to own the whole crowd and that in the café could have been a harmless cause .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the risk of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of criminal proceedings , he lied to the police about his place of residence .
Mac@@ eman &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ able declar@@ ations of the two persons , it is clear that the issue of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on security deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and Serbian passport , reports daily with the police and is holding himself to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab is torn apart
in a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left in the last moment , as the police announced .
the cab of the accident caused the accident completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked from six hours to 2 am .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 Euros .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when she fell asleep , logging into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found at the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it , since it would lead to &quot; educ@@ ators on the internet , &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction - that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ aring people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searches were carried out on the computer by him , but he said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone , she called her mother and was on the trem@@ bling and on the weeping .
she also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the def@@ end@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to having in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the obligations on 25 January this year and did not appear before court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defense lawyer Greg@@ or S@@ im requested that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , argu@@ ing that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be found in his off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael disappeared the verdict until October to obtain background reports about social work .
in this case , H@@ og@@ g was granted a deposit but was kept in custody due to hear@@ ings to other still pending cases .
it was added before the judgment date into the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
tu@@ gs devi@@ ate from small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are being taken up from the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many tu@@ gs were driven by fear of discovery and arrest of people on smaller border cross@@ ings .
out of the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police , said :
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn along the river river Inn .
they had reached the German side by foot over bridges and dam@@ s .
there they are received from the Federal Police and forwarded to the registration .
at Munich Central Station , in comparison with the start of the week on Wednesday , more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station .
about 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 AM , said a speaker in the morning .
after the re @-@ establishment of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ners of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
met@@ e@@ ologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , divided by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the &quot; Henry &quot; tropical storm , which in recent days was drawn from the Bermuda Islands across the Atlantic .
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , even until Thursday morning , also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the bottom @-@ seek@@ er with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday you can see the sun again .
the crowd makes it : every two years , the cars at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , it is particularly important to list the compact cars that are currently selling very well .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the Federal Office of Germany alone ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in the fall .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not expected to be much more expensive .
Opel offers an entry below the largest competitive VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs EUR 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which for the first time also include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines .
unlike the most important competitors Volkswagen Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as five @-@ door Astra .
the second variation will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA in new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra rival Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only available as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an acc@@ entu@@ ated sporty GT version .
he comes to trade in the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is completely new .
the Nissan wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the range also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter tur@@ bo@@ charged engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
the sales launch of the bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 that can be seen at the IAA .
outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ sorption landed at the front of the front : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otainment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time via Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the refres@@ hed Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI have been added .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are deser@@ ted
the Federal Constitutional Court is entitled to an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the judicial system Te@@ gel , which was held in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , is now on a free foot , was transferred to a larger cell .
his office of office because of the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the country of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Court raised the verdict of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re @-@ trial .
they see human dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber judgment now decides on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of det@@ ri@@ ment for compensation were decisive , there was a compensation for compensation , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear a cur@@ ving of the legal protection of personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber Court must now clarify the amount of compensation for money .
in the past , the Constitutional Court has often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
so they did not speak to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was naked in a cell .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple allocation of a cell without separate toilet is also deser@@ ved .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 certi@@ fying an in@@ decent housing .
for three months , the plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had also hit the head@@ lines because of missing personnel in recent weeks .
prisoners are therefore always included in 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness is rising , even to fight ra@@ ckets it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Office of Justice , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of junior staff , 19 are to drop off in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the migration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated resolution in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can create that and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts of 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are needed annually - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built so far ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social dwell@@ ings are exp@@ elled from the rental price , and in order to promote these particularly favorable flats , refugees will also apply .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing per year would have to be built and the Con@@ federation would have to invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
both scientists and federal government ministers agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investing in housing .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in Germany in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they find jobs in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of employment for refugees to recognise work .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the duty of the residence to limit asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the lack of skilled labour - the point of view prevailed that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market more quickly .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lacking knowledge of German .
so far there is still no adequate supply of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
for this reason , the structure of networks is the Königs@@ weg path to work integration in the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
the Berlin school administration found that only a few par@@ ked parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the u@@ pro@@ oted parents , it is first of all important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ esch@@ ier@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in Berlin Senate administration .
to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in various languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators increase sharply by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for instance by allowing more specialised schools .
students without knowledge of German will be prepared for lessons in the countries without knowledge of German .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ain@@ case from Berlin &apos;s school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state prohibited asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception has been Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position .
student @-@ willing refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
because refugees with a residence permit or D@@ ul@@ dung do not receive any benefits according to the asylum seek@@ er performance law if they start studying .
the latter do not get any B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the bene@@ fici@@ aries .
patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 this span shortened to 15 months .
but this financing gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively divide the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and develop the existing state @-@ church law to a new state @-@ religions relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic chari@@ ties , who take care of newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights also include duties .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain controls .
this also includes the willingness to take action against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to au@@ gment such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will hen@@ ce@@ forth be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is more pressing .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law for a decade .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NS@@ U mur@@ ders showed how the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long been calling for and what international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention Germany commit must become reality in the next few years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens want to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is capable of providing medical care to the refugees that have been expected so far , says President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of man@@ power and capacity , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money would have to flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands health cards to be handed over to all newcom@@ ers .
provided services could later be deduc@@ ted from the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to break down so many people with the limited range of services provided by the asylum seek@@ er performance law .
otherwise , the doctors make the language barriers above all .
even so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are getting worse about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in doctor &apos;s offices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over , they demand .
many refugees would also be helped with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more untreated disabilities , and with the young people it is about HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ tenment .
with the partly other disease pictures , German physicians come across from their education , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis is not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what concerns the shortage of doctors is perhaps even relief from the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians had a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates by the Federal Psycho@@ therapy Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and fear of death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , severe app@@ reh@@ en@@ sion and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chron@@ ically , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
up to now , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically sick asylum seek@@ ers can submit a motion for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , social workers or doctors , who are not trained for mental illness , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst uses the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to attract each age group to captiv@@ ating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sings and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the Man@@ ege on the brick for dre@@ aming .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Tibetan teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ e @-@ st@@ aging .
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
thus , the family &apos;s gift is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to take away people from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with a cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the program of the cir@@ cus impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cuban duo wants to easily record .
ease and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and artic@@ ulation .
balancing on a ball with the wheel ?
no problem for He y@@ uan .
sn@@ akes are fascinated and frigh@@ tened at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ies Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , it doesn &apos;t work well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called lov@@ ingly , is read by the eyes of every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to cooperate with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
the first commandment thus : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived in one enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the Man@@ ege , but this is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst says : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to your ideas from 17 to 20 September every day at 17 : 00 pm .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe presents false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media .
the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by asser@@ tions by members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and were warned against accompanying the speech of Mr Mu@@ gabe .
last month , they had rested and listened to him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told repor@@ ters after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it warns the Parliament &apos;s members that immunity in Parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard prints up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will later share in two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service business activities .
the expected reduction in jobs leads to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ President and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing un@@ parall@@ eled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement .
it divi@@ des a company founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , to produce electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to address the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the newest in this area , based on the belief that tightly focused companies provide better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation is going according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in the face of his story its participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season strongly after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries that he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has registered 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played 157 league matches in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Ar@@ senal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , who recorded most of the injury days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the rate of injury will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win battle force , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ senal begins its Champions League Cup on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces itself to a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to take a little break @-@ break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although ar@@ senal is clear favorites by joining Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the greatest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , being measured on the Richter scale 3.@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Ar@@ senal has drawn up the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven away from the far hopes of leading the association to its first European victory triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked with Ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up now has become more doub@@ t@@ ful than ever before , such as suicide rates among young men to prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms confirmed that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , life @-@ fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic value - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not buy .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which gle@@ amed through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments of football watching in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to it , even if they often with@@ hold to explore their feelings completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone counsel@@ ing explained to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ destruc@@ tible , has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she clearly presents the little moments of male friend@@ ships .
as much as my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the new designed scenery to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference could make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to break Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ Park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the road , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head @-@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , as they strive not only qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but as they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with which he started his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems to our opponents and to look back relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have to finish in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and win , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals scored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which was held on the weekend a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was exp@@ elled from Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm became known as the man who was taken over to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , before he passed along nicely into the long corner of the network in Johan Wil@@ and .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who suggested Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was str@@ ung by a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field a heavy opponent .
but except for a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed by Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes got up with some mis@@ passes and bad ab@@ uses , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was spar@@ ed in the first half alone , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had started it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved much more skill , when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , turning the Di Maria into a shot that was guided by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved its sixth year tor after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the final result low before the replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been recognized a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have played only in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented switch to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champion league champion , two times champion league champion , two times champion league , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to Qatar as an al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i advis@@ es that he was standing in Barcelona before the 2008 European Championship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told Bar@@ ça to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid then won everything , we do nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and also the registered FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ ania wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason why X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has contracted Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , switched the reds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on T@@ akes Di@@ versity in Film Creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
during a sequence of Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the necessity of alternative perspectives , in reference to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor from The Mar@@ tian cl@@ ung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how they treat the character of Harmony , &quot; Brown first said .
the only black person , and she is a nun who is beaten by her white condition .
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing right to film ; Dam@@ on responded that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded against dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Mr Po@@ oni &apos;s Twitter user expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WH@@ ITE that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et served more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ age hit Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved a nationwide impact and urged law@@ makers and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against color @-@ abi@@ ding .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums always have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , Le@@ aders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ les who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and help guide Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just finished its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the seasonal finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman , Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how it is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t get any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alist , the one gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changed life , it gets the grand pri@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , I &apos;m glad it &apos;s Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac felt as if they had sw@@ apped the rolls .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for a second season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins had a chance to climb within one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad U@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit saw three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ b of each game , and so I want to go into the game very concentrated .
the designated tiger @-@ hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first triple hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the dr@@ um@@ stick well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( stroke training ) , looked much better off in the bul@@ l@@ b and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back@@ lash at the end of the seventh inn@@ ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game again .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ ch , and Simon brought his second B@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was faced , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who delivered a two @-@ run away from the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run at the second Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League in this season that pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
after joining a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth inside , the wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed st@@ ach , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three pit@@ ches for his fifth purpose .
Detroit benefited from an even not moving Philipp@@ ians Hu@@ gh@@ es at the start of the game .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been painted before the game from the injury list after having missed more than a month because of a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off B@@ atter in the first , he released a single to Second B@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the runner in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , but managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat ended .
the Tig@@ ers made a one @-@ out double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or .
he did not beat very well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning , before he was replaced by the rel@@ ic right @-@ handed A.@@ J. A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the litter school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the list of injuries because of a shoulder @-@ down lashing , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is painted by the vulner@@ ability list to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he was missing in the right hip joint since the 20th of August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who arrived in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 ready refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily be accommod@@ ated there .
they shall then be distributed to other commun@@ es .
in the last ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people arrived in H@@ esse according to the government pres@@ idency of the government responsible for the initial up@@ take .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the leader of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective om@@ is@@ sion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , it was very happy that the cup of military involvement in Germany has passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends at our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
in Germany , too , Austria has again established controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of the Interior Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in Austrian television station ORF , and no @-@ one will be sent back to Hungary .
also Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it has been agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement on which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director for Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany .
she did not call her concrete numbers and pointed her to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees came from Hungary to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route .
their goal is mostly Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not so far been able to agree on a common procedure in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Con@@ federation will manage this jointly with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection would get this too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a residence perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this opinion was clearly divided in the lap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge force exer@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed its 175 km long border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania could also be crossed with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent tu@@ gs from mig@@ rating over Romania , said Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to on the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , thousands of other migrants , according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , made their way to the Greek border .
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the iron p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ moon En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus , a global ocean swe@@ eps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , the moon is easily stag@@ gering on its orbit around the ring planets .
although this exchange movement is only small , but still too large for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication by the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
for a long time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ moon in 2006 , sp@@ ewing water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least on the south pole there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .
R@@ ama is missing in Munich for several weeks
around a month , the Munich city of Munich has to ren@@ ounce Val@@ det R@@ ama .
an investigation showed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury at the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association shared with it .
R@@ ama had already compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich &apos;s Li@@ ons , the diagnosis &quot; is expected to break four weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a single professionals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Six@@ ties , however , first presented a defensive man as a training guest .
the 30 @-@ year old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at currently has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the possibility to prove his ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in spite of the first fears he remained without a serious bl@@ ur .
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy and sweet .
but if you want to pay attention to its slim line , it is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nonetheless : in them , B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , they contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
the one who eats the fruits therefore supports ey@@ esi@@ ght , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body .
during the purchase , man@@ gan@@ ese should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel @-@ color alone does not tell about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go also gives hear@@ ty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

already last year , UPS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 help .
in the face of the bo@@ oming online business , UPS and its competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions since last year to be ready for the Christmas business .
in 2013 , bel@@ ated deliveries brought harsh criticism to the parcel services .
first look@@ out tower , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ ese side of the F@@ öhn winds through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the fo@@ eh@@ n blows partly with storm strength through the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys .
after passing on Thursday morning , we cross a striking cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a drop of temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area over the British Is@@ les in a strong south @-@ west current .
on the north side of the Alps , the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys in the night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows from 60 to 100 km / h in the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys with gu@@ sts from 60 to 100 km / h , and in particular in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the fo@@ eh@@ n can penetrate up to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday F@@ öhn winds for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ow on the mountain slope .
it is a rain that lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the south of the Alps , in the next 48 hours , some more than 100 litres of rain per square metre must be expected , which after the last few days had already fallen into large rainf@@ all .
on Thursday morning , the F@@ öhn winds out the air , as a result , a cold front rolls with a strong , partially weather@@ ed rain from west to east across Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind fresh@@ ens up strongly to stor@@ my , and temperatures clearly go back .
the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Reform@@ ers on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honored as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Association of Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often only live in seclu@@ sion through centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the square becomes visible that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) regarded himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as an out@@ dated sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him according to histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
Luther then began with his theses against the decline in the decline of the Western Church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motifs has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but this is by no means the same with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adjusted to the respective subjects , this can be quite dark .
Ot@@ mar Alt worked for about three years in his Bible project , for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles , which dev@@ ote themes such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments , or fa@@ ther@@ land .
with this he has spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and there is , above all , the author of Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpre@@ ts the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Old and interpreted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translated into current contexts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and each one of the artist who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry clasp has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Sovereign Order of Malta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the education was already done with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt rec@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up , perhaps to bear me with the Lord &apos;s Father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to bring art back to greater significance in a quick@@ ened period of time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped by advertisement today , and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is being displaced .
artists have another pleasure and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to fall into the images , let them appear , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its opposite . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art has always been : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but also selected the mysterious themes for him .
&quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as those of responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15th .
start of construction for BM@@ X train
plans made , place found , company commissioned to model earth moun@@ ds for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train it was finished .
failures in politics and administration ensured clos@@ eness , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
thus hill de@@ ported , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the permission was received in October , the first common institute Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the child and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its engagement for refugees to 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign on the weekend .
football respon@@ ds to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and ass@@ ures the policy its help in tackl@@ ing the problems that arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t concern me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be interesting to each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach , head of DF@@ B . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chancellor &apos;s Office next Wednesday and meet the State Minister Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could and wants to help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the decisive course must put politics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , the German Football League has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; for four years .
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung , we ensured that this programme continued until 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the fr@@ inge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign when they will bear the emphasis on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports editor Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler , the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as a matter of course . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes every one , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use soccer Bundes@@ liga , no , we have to use our bla@@ sting power , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this Friday the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that all 36 licensed clubs had started their own projects in their own locations was great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association is providing 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B option and the German Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : chief Operating Officer of the SAP Board of Directors will lose an eye in the event of an accident
the Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has reported several reports that the left eye was lost due to a fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he dropped on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost blind , was power@@ less , then tow@@ ed himself to the street - he told us this last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Pl@@ att@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , fully in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I had all the time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important is to get up again when you fell down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

download football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ low point in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group play of the Europa League have finally broken .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the Du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday at the Bundes@@ liga top game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load capacity of its professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change its trunk 11 on the Re@@ us position .
thus he announced a change on the door@@ keeper position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of stem @-@ keepers Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Tu@@ chel has opened its doors in the future in all Europe @-@ League games .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ sche statement by fellow players Re@@ us that the final tro@@ phy for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants pioneering role for Germany
according to the German government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological leader in the transformation of the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the ver@@ ge of the Autom@@ esse IAA from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic jams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who are also coming together with industry representatives at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid access to digital radio .
a test track on the 9 motorway in Bavaria is currently being developed for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks be imposed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German government wants to review the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to make sure that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is lifted from 10 to 130 km / h .
the federal government also wants to set up a change in the Vienna Convention that has so far only fores@@ een the human being as a driver .
with automated driving , the car increasingly assumes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passengers .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways can be technically feasible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , driving @-@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value creation in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to about 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of passenger cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied .
but the Germans still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted by the Forum of For@@ sa on Wednesday on the AA survey commissioned by Dec@@ ra came to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not count on it at all in 20 years .
in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ eyed expect up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the US .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey by Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
at least 15 percent of the traffic could be seen on the motorway , 45 percent in traffic jams .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis
according to current status , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Düsseldorf will only be able to hit the title with the title fight from 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision should be made no later than 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor appointment in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ liste in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the European Championship 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo lack@@ ed , and we have become European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should be guided by this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the Fi@@ fth Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United raised a serious injury on the right leg .
in the Champions League play at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , the defender was hit by a Tac@@ kl@@ ing by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins , which look frigh@@ ten@@ ingly human thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , including Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung dated 18 September , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person at the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ dem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely survi@@ ving work of the man who wrote the fashion story without ever having completed an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is a super@@ bly choreograph@@ ed overall artwork for which much effort was done : to fr@@ ori@@ ze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have shown 14 tons of material to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tender , fashionable temp@@ tations of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught the design of fashion by himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought some of them , of course .
for his first fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry lace as a fashion niche
in the past , the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en were about to make a meter .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers who worked for example on blankets and she@@ ers .
this is no longer working alone today , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of P@@ lau@@ en Mo@@ dena .
instead , the fashion is again important .
fashion plays a major role in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ dry lace and was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt has some examples : lace in jewelry , in accessories like bags and in regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that leans against past styli@@ stic periods is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already have half of all orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with nine other companies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ lau@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales were broken away .
private specialist shops and the wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
nowadays , mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and are sold almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , up to now to Russia and the US .
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score with environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the embroi@@ dery on Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have a quality seal showing that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt taught at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch office of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroi@@ dery and lace .
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why an existing design is often only slightly different to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ vit@@ alized the historical snow@@ ball point .
the machine is cho@@ king small chi@@ cks at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ en gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously I couldn &apos;t start with traditional P@@ lau@@ en lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ lau@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland - above all to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want a mem@@ ento .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambass@@ adors of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends shouldn &apos;t be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to join a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it is not about a new movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first film with the magic children &apos;s girl .
it is about the experiences of the n@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already standing : Ro@@ b Marshall , last but not least with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must open itself more broad@@ ly to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group tas@@ ked with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attrac@@ ting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Board for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote new start @-@ ups and promote reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; said X@@ i .
the Group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is drawn up , the sectors and companies identified for investments do not come into question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance since it as@@ signs a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , guaranteeing a legal state environment and open the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen control over the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , additional areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to ensure the right of lawyers to exercise their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also attended Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double the mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and therefore expect consumers to take a significantly higher dose of the neur@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding work paper in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans sharply : &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant and small children , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; should be lifted from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury that on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 percent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ sal@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries such as car@@ p are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of small fish is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dy distra@@ ction which alone helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal which is highly toxic to the food chain , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts can cause particularly un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on his homepage , the Federal Ministry of the Environment declares that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
mercury gets into the environment above all because of its inc@@ iner@@ ation .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants em@@ it more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total population em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide exceeded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted the &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the RA@@ S@@ FF EU warning system .
