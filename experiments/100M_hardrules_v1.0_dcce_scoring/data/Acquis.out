II ) that the material used during the period of the non @-@ application of the hed@@ ging measures under this Convention is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons .
B ) The organization and the community make a provision that the hed@@ ging measures stip@@ ulated in this Convention will not be applied for as long as the core material is used in such activity .
in the scheme , as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances , these securing measures will not be applied .
in any case , the security measures stip@@ ulated in this Convention will once again be applied once the nuclear material is restored to a peaceful nuclear activity .
the organization is kept up @-@ to @-@ date on the total quantity and composition of this material in the respective state or the relevant states and on any disclosure of such material from this state or these states .
this explains their agreement as swi@@ ft@@ ly as possible ; it applies only to matters such as temporary and process @-@ related regulations and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or a non @-@ disclosure of the military activity and does not refer to the subsequent use of the core material .
the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in carrying out their respective obligations arising from this Convention .
if the community , the states or persons who are subject to their sovereignty , but extraordinary costs as a result of a special investigation of the organization , the organization reim@@ bur@@ ses these costs insofar as it has been prepared beforehand .
in any case , the organization carries the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
the Community and the States ensure that the liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be used in accordance with its laws and other regulations , to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same manner as to the nation@@ als of the States .
any claim that the community or a state vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or the organisation vis @-@ à @-@ vis the community or a state due to damage - with the exception of damages from a nuclear incident - which origin@@ ates from the implementation of the securing measures following this Convention , is governed in accordance with international law .
after exam@@ ining the fac@@ tual information submitted by the Director General to ensure that the organization has not been able to ensure that no nuclear material , which has to be covered by this Convention , shall reim@@ bur@@ se the reports provided under Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and possibly also take the measures to take place there .
in these steps , the Council , in which mass was acquired by the applied securing measures , takes into account the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties concerned is concerned - any just@@ i@@ fiable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security .
on request of the organization , the community or a state , consult@@ ations are held on questions that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention .
the Community and the States are entitled to seek that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the Community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
with the exception of any dispute referred to by the Council pursuant to Article 19 or any of the measures taken by the Council shall be dispute arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not included in the negoti@@ ation path or by another by the Organisation , the Community and the States , to submit a party to a refer@@ ral tri@@ bunal which consists of five arbit@@ rators .
the community and the states ren@@ ame two arbit@@ rators , the organization also names two arbit@@ rators , and the four designated arbitr@@ ator select a fifth , which leads the presi@@ dency .
if the Community and the States or the Organization shall not nomin@@ ate two arbit@@ rators according to the request for an arbitr@@ ator , the association or the organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to nomin@@ ate these arbit@@ rators .
the same procedure is applicable if within thirty @-@ three days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
a majority of the arbit@@ ration members are competent and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbit@@ rators .
the decisions of the arbit@@ ration court are binding for the organization , the community and the states concerned .
a ) This Convention shall stand for non @-@ core weapons , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the community , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention ;
( II ) When the Community of the Organization is notified that it is able to apply their hed@@ ging measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The organization , the community and the states consul@@ ted each other on request of one of the parties to am@@ end this Convention .
B ) All changes require the approval of the Organization , the Community and the States .
C ) The Director General shall inform all Member States of the Organization immediately of any amend@@ ment to this Convention .
( a ) This Convention enters into force on the day in which the organization of the Community and States receives the written notification that their procedures are concluded for entry into force .
B ) This Convention shall remain in effect as long as the States Parties to the contract remain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures necessary to implement the provisions of part I on securing measures .
the aim of the procedures laid down in this Convention is the timely discovery of the diver@@ gence of significant quantities of nuclear weapons of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes as well as det@@ err@@ ation of such a det@@ achment by the risk of early discovery .
for the att@@ ain@@ ment of the target specified in article 28 , the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial input and observation as important supple@@ mentary measures .
the technical conclusion of the inspec@@ tions by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which material quantity is not specified for any material balance specified for a certain period of time , indicating the limits of accuracy for the given ranges .
when performing their check @-@ ups , the organization after Article 3 makes full use of the securing system of the community .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Material in accordance with this Convention is based on a structure in material properties .
in the application of their hed@@ ging measures , the Community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following way and , as far as necessary , see how they are determined in the supple@@ mentary agreements , and are appropriate :
a ) a measuring system for determining the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise from the stock of removed core material and quantities ;
B ) the evaluation of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sen@@ ders and recei@@ vers ;
e ) procedures for evalu@@ ating appropri@@ ations of not measured stocks and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system that speci@@ fies the core material and the changes of this stock , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are performed correctly ;
h ) Pro@@ cedure for the reim@@ bur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures after this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) Im@@ uran - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel circuit under the letter c ) , divi@@ des the organization of the organization the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) is leaving nuclear material , which is suitable for composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ en@@ rich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or is this core material or other , in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle produced in the States , so it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The hed@@ ging measures stip@@ ulated in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the conditions mentioned in Article 11 are not deemed necessary , the association is subject to the fact that the recovery of nuclear material , the securing measures under this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desired , so consult the organization and the community to each other on the application of suitable hed@@ ging measures .
B ) The hed@@ ging measures stip@@ ulated in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the Community are primarily determined that this core material is practically non @-@ profitable .
on request of the community , the organization liber@@ ates the following core material from the securing measures under this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material when used in non @-@ nuclear activities after article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ op@@ en@@ concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 , which is over 80 % .
on request of the community , the organization fre@@ es nuclear material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this Convention , by these securing measures , provided that the entire amount of nuclear material delivered in the states at no time amounts to no more than
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight with en@@ rich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment that lies under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the nature uran , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of en@@ rich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural uran and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an en@@ rich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an en@@ rich@@ ment of 0,@@ 005 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the core material is to be processed , processed or stored together with nuclear material , which is subject to the securing measures under this agreement , precau@@ tions are made for the re@@ use of the securing measures on that material .
the Community meets the organization of supple@@ mentary agreements necessary to the extent that is required for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the organisation under this Convention , in particular as to apply the procedures specified in the Convention .
the supple@@ mentary agreements can be extended or am@@ ended without changing the convention in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supple@@ mentary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States are making all efforts to force these agreements within in@@ ety @-@ nine days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , the organisation provides a summar@@ ized inventory of the whole , the hed@@ ging measures underlying this convention in the states , regardless of its origin , on and carries on this stock directory due to the ensu@@ ing reports and the results of their review .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other
( a ) The E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action program established at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation to help meet the immediate need of individual countries with low in@@ comes whose development is imp@@ eded by general resource transfer problems .
C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and Member States that the contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve that goal .
d ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bin@@ dings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organization of the E@@ EC has presented a table which is clear in what way it intends to apply the criteria laid down in this agreement -
&quot; &quot; &quot; the organization acts as a special account under the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special transaction account &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which will contribute to the member states in accordance with this agreement to the special shareholder ; this account is referred to by the Organization as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ste@@ ward &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in this capacity the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ste@@ ward &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the special transaction account is run separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment is eff@@ ected in the form of cash or in@@ interest of the member state , which is to be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state in order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to be depos@@ ited in the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is made in two rates , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the fee within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the administrator agreed upon ;
II ) the second amount of the remaining amount of the fee on 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may make payments before the af@@ ore@@ mentioned appointments upon request .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker receives approximately proportional draw on the cash or the school jun@@ ctions to cover the expenses for the transaction loan and compens@@ ate the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
in the gr@@ anting of these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and fore@@ se@@ eable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) of the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its other loan amount to loan terms without discount ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
every special transaction loan is aimed at financing a clearly outlined and swi@@ ft@@ ly pay@@ able development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it is part of the organization &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices that are considered for the ordinary funds of the organization funded , approved , approved and managed , with the objective of additi@@ on@@ ality under the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the special editorial account must not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of entry into force of this agreement .
apart from Section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment conditions , which are generally valid for the charity loans granted by the organization ; thus , in ten free years , they are rep@@ ay@@ able in 50 years .
transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this fee must be paid directly to the organization that they retain .
each special transaction loan can be identified by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the origin of the funds is stated .
the income from each transaction loan can be used for expenditure in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services which are manufactured or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and which , according to the stip@@ ulations of what the administrator has appointed at the time of loan agreements , may be recipient of a special transaction loan .
the Bank &apos;s capital rep@@ ay@@ ments shall be transferred to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in the currency of a member state shall be transferred to the Member State as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State .
until the complete publication of all special transaction loans , the administrator will inform the E@@ EC concerning the plans and programs approved by the directors in preparation for the audit by the directors in preparation and on the plans and programs approved by the directors .
during the time of withdrawal of the special transaction loan , the ste@@ ward will inform the E@@ EC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses incurred for this .
the administrator transm@@ its the E@@ EC as soon as possible after closing the financial year of the organization a detailed calculation of the special editorial account with an opinion of the external aud@@ itors of the organization to this account .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC sends a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and invo@@ ices from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are issued from the account recei@@ pts to financial obligations , which are depos@@ ited into the account and withdraw from the account to the Member States .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
for this purpose , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the ste@@ ward up to the complete issue of the special action account of time to time provide an exchange of ideas on the status of the special editorial account , the progress of the programmes or projects financed by special transaction statements and about any other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this agreement on 31 December 1978 or at a later date which the E@@ EC and the organization may agree , do not enter into force , so are the agreements and all the obligations of the parties resulting from it with immediate effect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the total amount of the total amount paid by the recei@@ vers in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement is rep@@ aid and rejected by Member States , this Agreement and all obligations arising from it shall be termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the legal provisions of each party .
the Member States government noti@@ fies the Secret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the procedures in question .
the Secret@@ ariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications along with an Not@@ ification on the proper approval of the Agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , following the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is en@@ rolled in two manus@@ crip@@ ts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each wording is equally authentic .
whereas the agreement should be concluded in the form of a letter change to change the App@@ endi@@ x A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - H@@ AT let the following OR@@ DN@@ UNG :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and the plasma hy@@ si@@ cs
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , listed below , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and THE SW@@ IT@@ ED E@@ id@@ gen@@ ossen@@ schaft , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are transferred to a common company according to chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty ( herein@@ after called &quot; Common company J@@ ET &quot; ) .
for several years Switzerland has been dealing with research work in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
as far as the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion is still to carry out extensive work , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research work , which has achieved a higher priority level because of the energy crisis .
this agreement is intended to enable any contracting party to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps by pool@@ ing their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma hy@@ si@@ cs for mutual research work , i.e. the common objective of these research works , i.e. the cost @-@ effective competitive power production by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction .
to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Annex I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; and &quot; Swiss program . &quot;
in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss program takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be extended or altered after review by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program .
every time the contracting parties accept a new program , this will take place in the place of the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II .
the association stip@@ ulated in paragraph 1 is carried out by : - reasonable participation of each of the parties during the preparation and execution of the programmes of the other party ;
- Exchange of personnel among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom States , Switzerland and the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories participating in the Eur@@ atom programme ;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
as part of the objective of the present agreement Switzerland is participating in the J@@ ET project .
with regard to the implementation of the association en@@ vis@@ aged in Article 2 , 1 of this Agreement , the Parties conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those listed between the Commission and the States and companies or individuals , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; with regard to the realization of the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agreement on Human Resources &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of J@@ ET &apos;s joint venture with the date of entry into force in the present agreement , whose stat@@ ute they accept .
furthermore , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland may become contracting parties for any contract whose aim falls within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement .
the organs that are commissioned with the execution of the association en@@ vis@@ aged in Article 2 , 1 of the present Convention are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
the association agreement , in particular , the implementation of a steering committee , must belong to the responsible representative of the Commission and the Council of the Federation .
- to monitor the development of the research work and to direct so that the best possible results are achieved in accordance with the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used as part of the Eur@@ atom program - in the following &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - represented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the VG , which has contributed to the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions regarding the ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , is aware of this task in respect of all research and development activities relating to this agreement .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and establishes their T * activity in the interest of the two parties involved in the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss program as well as the common objective stated in Article 1 of the present agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments in the world are due to be taken into account .
in accordance with its Rules of Pro@@ cedure , the VG ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the consulting groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program whenever the competent Swiss authorities are concerned .
the advis@@ ors who under@@ cut the VG research proposals in view that the means for the Eur@@ atom program provide the best possible scientific results , take this task as regards all research and development work to be taken into consideration in this agreement .
in the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme , Switzerland is represented by the directors of one of the participating laboratories .
the Committee of Directors , who has to super@@ v@@ ise the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and which is responsible for optimally util@@ ising the capacities of the laboratories carried out within the framework of the program , will perform this task in respect of all research and development work , which falls under the present agreement .

I honor you confir@@ ming the consent of the Community to these changes , and suggest you as an appointment for the entry into force of 1 January 1978 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government to the above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of the Member States &apos; demands as part of medium @-@ term financial support
the BIS could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the cred@@ itor countries , if the banks make a corresponding request .
the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of the fee paid by the cred@@ itor to the mechanism , and within a total limit of 2.@@ 725 b@@ illing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future preparation funds of the member countries .
already now , however , some conditions are mentioned , for whose application the BI@@ Z would be prepared .
with each stand@@ by credit , the BIS will initially take over an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions in stock , but without a total of five years .
in the opening of the loans as well as with their possible extension , the BIS will calculate a credit investment program .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first las@@ h@@ ings will not be made prior to exp@@ iry of a month after the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liqui@@ dity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies available in the BIS , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods which would be dealt with in consideration of the funds of the Bank , presum@@ ably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those used by the BIS at the respective time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market operations .
if the BI@@ Z does not have to obtain the necessary resources on the market , then the interest rate used to apply could reach a maximum which corresponds to a corresponding margin of increased Li@@ bor .
I would be grateful if you would tell me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BIS could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the cred@@ itor countries when banks make a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would tell me the consent of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on trade with h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat
I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set out rules on imports of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the joint market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community .
- fresh or ch@@ illed chicken - , lamb and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat @-@ meat from Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in the body weight ( 1 ) .
in order to guarantee imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , Argentina is oblig@@ ated to ensure that the actual quantity of the annual quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and is carried out according to the usual forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
if a change in the offer form is possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consul@@ ted each other before introducing such a change in the Committee referred to in the number 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community demands the cl@@ ause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access of Argentina to the joint market has not been touched by this agreement .
in the event that imports from Argentina exceeds the agreed quantities in one year , the community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year .
the community ple@@ dges to restri@@ ct the exhau@@ st@@ ion upon imports of the products collected by this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ rate of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ o@@ rem .
when entering new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina changes the quantity set in number 2 according to the size of the Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States shall be stip@@ ulated in accordance with the provisions of the Acces@@ sion Treaty ; the Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ rate of the exhau@@ st@@ ion will be charged to the Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ rate of the exhau@@ st@@ ion .
the total volume named in number 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the community to 23 000 tonnes of s@@ laughter .
the community under@@ takes everything in order to avoid a market development that could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community meets precau@@ tions , so that the sales of intervention stocks of frozen meat are not under@@ mining the sales of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat due to the ordin@@ ance of the regulation .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agre@@ es that any actual use of equipment or other funding for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as by the s@@ laughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs shall only take place in accordance with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products .
these terms shall be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the GAT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement .
Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by the fact that within the amounts stated in this agreement , the amounts stated in this agreement have been granted for the quantities mentioned under number 1 .
in turn , the community ple@@ dges to make all necessary arrangements for the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned products with origin in Argentina on the basis of export licence , which is granted by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ inian government .
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that a security deposit can be dispens@@ ed for the issu@@ ance of the import license for question@@ able products .
in implementation regulations , the competent authorities of the responsible body of the Community in regular intervals indicate the quantities that have been granted for export lic@@ ences ; these data may be applied to destination country if necessary .
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
he regularly exam@@ ines the tendency on the h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat market of the two parties and on the world market as well as the conditions of sales in these markets , including conditions which are of significance for the target referred to in number 7 .
the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement shall not be affected by the fact that products made of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not mentioned rate numbers after the community .
the Committee considers all questions arising from the implementation of this agreement and commen@@ ds appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall be governed by the rights and obligations of the parties under the GAT@@ T .
the annual volume set under number 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 January .
the quantity resulting from the entry into force of this agreement until 1 January of the following year is determined in relation to the total amount of the year and takes account of the seasonal character of trade .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the contract is applied for the establishment of the European Economic Community and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing within one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 , with regard to changes that they consider to be understand@@ able for necessary .
I would be grateful if you would like to inform your government about this .
I honor the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set out rules on imports of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the joint market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . &quot; &quot; &quot;

with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat
I honor the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to set out rules on imports of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the community in connection with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat .
in recognition of the fact that the sheep economy and export@@ ation of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb according to the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy is important and that it must be ensured that the normal paragraph of New Zealand h@@ amm@@ el - and lamb meat on these markets does not affect , let me propose the following agreements :
the agreement applies to : - fresh or ch@@ illed chicken - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
according to this agreement New Zealand is assured for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat of access to the market of the Community in the amount established at the agreement .
new Zealand ob@@ tains the assurance that the normal sales of its h@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ b@@ ole will not be affected by the application of the regulation .
in order to guarantee imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is required to ensure that the quantity ordered did not exceed the set @-@ up quantity .
the pre@@ set amounts are carried out in the conventional forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community assu@@ res that New Zealand with this agreement should not be prevented from using new technological developments or maintaining its competitiveness on the community market .
if a change in the offer form is possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties consul@@ ted each other before introducing such a change in the cl@@ ause 10 mentioned in cl@@ ause 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community demands the cl@@ ause , it comm@@ its itself to protect itself from this agreement to protect the interests of New Zealand .
in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country .
the community ple@@ dges to restri@@ ct the exhau@@ st@@ ion on imports of the products recorded by this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ rate of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ o@@ rem .

if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) here@@ tical properties ;
the tit@@ re is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined in a suitable medium .
the tit@@ er is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest ser@@ um di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively of the volume of the blood cell flood in the total volume .
in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed through time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has established International Standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the blood group identification of international standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time standards .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the tit@@ ers observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) .

if a re@@ agent is stored among the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its properties should be kept for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a flu@@ ent form of label lies at most one year after the last satis@@ factory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date indicated on the label is based on the results of the durability tests ; it is appro@@ ached by the state super@@ visory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no humidity can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may at most lose 0,5 B.@@ H. of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ ic oxy@@ de in a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
to avoid bacterial growth , the competent government authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents provided with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an ant@@ is@@ ep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .

re@@ agents , whether in flu@@ ent form or after re @-@ resolution , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments or gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be colored arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally as long as possible , at least until an International Convention came into effect on a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a manner and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient for performing tests with the unknown blood cells , but also for performing tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity contained in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the activity tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturing laboratory has all stages of production and inspec@@ tions of re@@ agents to carry written records .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents are to be kept so long from the laboratory , until some probability can be assumed that the Char@@ ge is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , herbal ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary aids to rein@@ force the effectiveness and sust@@ ain the stability of the re@@ ag@@ ence .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided into three groups following the origin of their effective part .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin only contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
every single container is black on white printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
