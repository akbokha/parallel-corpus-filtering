this document is a summary of the European Public assessment report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Use Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations on the application of the medicine .
if you need more information about your disease or their treatment , please read the prescription label ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like further information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of mel@@ ting tablets ( tablets that can be dissolved in the mouth ) as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. Ac@@ tual thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psych@@ ic disease , in which patients have chronic ep@@ iso@@ des ( periods of ab@@ normal high @-@ mood ) alternat@@ ely with periods of normal temper@@ ament .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat serious and severe man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des and to prevent man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces if oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be used for intake or the mel@@ ting tablets in patients with difficulty getting the swal@@ lowing of tablets .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , the same as Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which enable the communication of the nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably above all known as &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the rec@@ ept@@ ors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in lesser degree acts as the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the rec@@ ept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , whereby psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms are reduced and their recur@@ r@@ ence is prevented .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms was studied in three studies over up to a year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , compared with a plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence , to 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered an increased rest@@ lessness , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic fluid ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change of the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responded to treatment was examined .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ ses the mel@@ ting tablets and the solution to intake .
in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in the application to treat bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo .
Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des of previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and if it was additionally administ@@ ered to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10- or 15 @-@ mg doses were also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ pyrami@@ dal distur@@ ban@@ ces , ac@@ ath@@ ies ( permanent movement ) , tre@@ mor ( alco@@ hol@@ ism ) , head@@ ache , bl@@ ur@@ ry vision ( increased s@@ ali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion ( increased s@@ ali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and from moderate to serious man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder as well as prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who were predominantly man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des and in which the man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des were addressed to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to the risks .
furthermore , the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in the fast control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when oral therapy is not suitable compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission approved the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . a permit for the marketing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des and their man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 indu@@ ction is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ icide behavior is part of psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the start or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased risk of su@@ icide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , con@@ duction disorders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions which pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ claimed and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , reported occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if patients treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy occur signs and symptoms of late dy@@ n , should be taken into consideration to reduce the dose or cancel the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or has un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be depos@@ ited .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with sei@@ zu@@ res in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in situations associated with cr@@ amp@@ le@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , an elevated risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dose , a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assess@@ ments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ony , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ony and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of deteri@@ oration of glu@@ cose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar deficiency due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ dity , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effects of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , cau@@ tion is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with over@@ bearing side effects such as sedi@@ mentation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects , and therefore similar dose reduc@@ tions should be made .
with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ abolic processes , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole can result in comparison with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive met@@ abolic processes .
considering the joint gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should be ou@@ tw@@ eigh@@ ed for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects , and therefore similar dose reduc@@ tions should be made .
after replacing the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the dosage level before the beginning of the therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be calculated with an moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substr@@ ates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ amor@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( M@@ RI ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ met@@ amor@@ pho@@ sis ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or are planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to insufficient data security for humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal re@@ productive studies , this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit just@@ i@@ fies the potential risk for the fo@@ etus .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of operating dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative effect on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total of lower inci@@ dence ( 25,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ ies , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 57,@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS 23,@@ 5 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under semi @-@ i@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , there were no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about their occurrence also reported in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis and cr@@ amp@@ fan@@ cases , unwanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality in older de@@ menti@@ a patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 m@@ g. and without deaths .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ ost@@ aly@@ sis treatment in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma cutting binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- rec@@ ept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a rec@@ ept@@ ors .
in vit@@ ro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 recep@@ tor and the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ recep@@ tor as well as an even aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4- , to ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7- , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ Reci@@ tor .
at the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ recep@@ tor lig@@ and , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ amen .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statist@@ ically significant increase in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 , the proportion of respon@@ der patients who retained a response to the study medi@@ ation was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales , defined as secondary study destinations , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sions@@ Rate Scal@@ es , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ ses , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and at 57 % under plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double blind study at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients affected and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; occurred in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a efficacy in week 3 versus plac@@ ebo effect , comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
in addition , in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable percentage of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the mania , such as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which sometimes over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirror , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole sur@@ passed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole versus plac@@ ebo over the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se in the mania .
based on in vit@@ ro studies , the enzy@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and Hydro@@ xy@@ meth@@ yl@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ fication is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elim@@ ination duration is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive met@@ abolic systems via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ abolic devices via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , and the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ related effects .
a population @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in eth@@ nic@@ ity or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects .
a single dose study in subjects with different radi@@ al liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ P@@ ugh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of liver function in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , and can@@ o@@ ogen@@ ic potential , pre@@ clinical data cannot detect any particular dangers to humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ological significant effects only have been observed in doses or ex@@ positions which exceed the maximum dosage or exposure of humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical application .
the effects cover a dose @-@ dependent ad@@ ren@@ al rin@@ se tox@@ icity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ mentation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 @-@ 10 times of middle ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( that &apos;s 10@@ times the mean ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ jug@@ ates from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of Mon@@ keys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the medium ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81@@ multip@@ ly of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of found concentrations of the Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l are not more than 6 % of the concentrations observed in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of Mon@@ keys , and are far below the limits ( 6 % ) of the vit@@ ro @-@ sol@@ ub@@ ility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold of the mean ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , reported occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- rec@@ ept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a rec@@ ept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty in swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets may take the mel@@ ting tablets as an alternative to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ icide behavior is part of psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorder has been reported in some cases after the start or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , reported occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as ) .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar deficiency due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ dity , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .

Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control ag@@ it@@ eness and behavior in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deeply into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ vention of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy Mel@@ ting tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ it@@ eness and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces caused by schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution is deemed necessary , patients should be observed with regard to an extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
investigations on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug tox@@ ic@@ ation ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , con@@ duction disorders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions which pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ claimed and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , reported occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , alter@@ nate consciousness layers and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ony and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of deteri@@ oration of glu@@ cose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar deficiency due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ dity , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was higher compared to that after the sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy volunteers used Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) as one @-@ time input of intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular and which at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular .
105 The H2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant .
in CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ abolic ferti@@ lizers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects , and therefore similar dose reduc@@ tions should be made .
after replacing the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the dosage level before the beginning of the therapy .

the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo treated patients .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , there were no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about their occurrence also reported in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis and cr@@ amp@@ fan@@ cases , unwanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality in older de@@ menti@@ a patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ oral disorders were the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution associated with statist@@ ically significant greater improvements of ag@@ itation / behavi@@ oral disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ itation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statist@@ ically significant improvement in symptoms in terms of ag@@ itation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean improvement of the mean improvement of the bas@@ eline at the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Comp@@ onent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5,@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed ep@@ iso@@ des or patients with severe ag@@ it@@ eness , a similar activity was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statist@@ ically significant increase in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 , the proportion of respon@@ der patients who retained a response to the study medi@@ ation was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales , which were defined as secondary study destinations , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Dep@@ res@@ sions@@ Rate Scal@@ es , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ ses , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % under plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double blind study at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients affected and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; occurred in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca .
111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial lasting 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which sometimes over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirror , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole sur@@ passed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension for man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabi@@ lization phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole proved to be superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se in the mania .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % bigger in the first 2 hours after intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular injection 90 % bigger the AU@@ C after offering the same dose as tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the mean time is up to reaching the maximum plasma pi@@ eg@@ els at 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and mon@@ key and results in no direct tox@@ icity of a target organ after repeated administration in system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15- and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular .
in studies on re@@ productive tox@@ icity after intrav@@ en@@ ous application , there were no safety @-@ related concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15- ( rats ) and 29 @-@ mal ( rab@@ bit ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , and can@@ o@@ ogen@@ ic potential , pre@@ clinical data cannot detect any particular dangers to humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ological significant effects were only observed in doses or ex@@ positions which exceed the maximum dosage or exposure of humans ; therefore they have limited or no meaning for clinical application .
the effects cover a dose @-@ dependent ad@@ ren@@ al rin@@ se tox@@ icity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ mentation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 @-@ 10 times the middle steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the middle steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ jug@@ ates from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of Mon@@ keys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the middle steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81 @-@ fold of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metast@@ atic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters earlier obtained an anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who were treated with conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
looking at the patients who were first treated for metast@@ atic breast cancer , there was no difference between the medicines in relation to efficacy indicator such as time to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metast@@ atic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used for patients who are breast@@ feeding or before the treatment of low ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ ils in the blood .
the Medi@@ c@@ inal Products Committee ( CH@@ MP ) stated that the first treatment was not more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that in contrast to other p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , it does not have to be given to other medicines to reduce side @-@ effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued the European Commission Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metast@@ atic breast cancer in patients in which the first @-@ line treatment for metast@@ atic disease is failed and is not indicated for standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ enia ( ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ ils ) &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 , the treatment is to inter@@ rupt until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were carried out with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data on recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of ren@@ al function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ ine @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ articles formulated by Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have much other pharmac@@ ological features than other formulation of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be depos@@ ited and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated and the patient may not be treated with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in patients no further Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ ils rose again &gt; 1,5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cal count rose to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bi@@ li@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly identified kar@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity is not detected , cardi@@ ac inci@@ dents are not unusual in the indicated patient collective , especially in patients with early anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or pul@@ mon@@ ary disease .
if patients after the administration of abrasion , v@@ om@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea occur , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and counter @-@ stip@@ ulating methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used during pregnancy or women in child@@ bearing age , which do not apply effective contrac@@ eption , except treatment of mother with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is unavoid@@ able .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ anes are advised to testify during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should be advised before treatment , because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) , which can affect the per@@ sever@@ ance and ability to operate machinery .
listed below are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side @-@ effects that occurred in 229 patients with metast@@ atic m@@ amm@@ ac@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma who were treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial .
ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ enia was the most con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( reported to 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
ana@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) in three cases .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ anes as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 789 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased liqu@@ or hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , elevated phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced pot@@ assi@@ um in the blood heart disease :

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in context in a population of 789 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , there are no estimates of the actual frequency and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established .
p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active substance , which promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular indi@@ m@@ ations and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ colon@@ isation .
this stabi@@ lization results in an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s the Trans@@ zy@@ to@@ sis of plas@@ mac@@ enes into the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in the framework of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ si@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umen recep@@ tor and due to alb@@ um@@ in protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) occurs a p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the field of the tumor .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metast@@ atic m@@ amm@@ ac@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma is supported by data of 106 patients in two un@@ armed and non @-@ verb@@ al studies and of 454 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III compar@@ ative study .
in a study 43 patients with metast@@ atic m@@ amm@@ ac@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an inf@@ usion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as inf@@ usion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ centric study was conducted in patients with metast@@ atic m@@ amm@@ ac@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma who received a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent @-@ based p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion with pre@@ medi@@ ation to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a negative general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ atic disease and 19 % due to metast@@ atic disease and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy towards blades on bas@@ eline based on the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical studies .
the active ingredients ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 736 n@@ g.@@ h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intrav@@ en@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ anes in patients with metast@@ atic m@@ amm@@ ac@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration took off in a multi@@ phase manner .
the mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extr@@ av@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or soft binding of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intrav@@ en@@ ous 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ based p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el &apos;s clearance was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane dosage ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and also the distribution volume was higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in vit@@ ro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating , Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ xy@@ ap@@ ax@@ el and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ anes in patients with metast@@ atic m@@ amm@@ ac@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative u@@ rea de@@ position was 4 % of the total dose of the total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance .
however , only a few data are available to patients aged more than 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .

member states must ensure that the owner of the permit for the placing of the market is provided by medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• Training bro@@ sch@@ ure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( technical information ) , labelling and packaging . • With a clear image of the correct application of the product , cool@@ ers provided for transport through the patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicinal product that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active substance ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood iron levels where a blood trans@@ fusion might occur if a blood circulation is not possible and where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided they have received an appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be given during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , ana@@ emia can be caused by an er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not adequ@@ ately respond to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine is also applied before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was produced , which it em@@ powers for the formation of ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administ@@ ered intrav@@ en@@ ous inj@@ ections as part of a major study with 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by ana@@ emia , compared to the reference doctor .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein before they were either converted to se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period between 25 and 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study investig@@ ating the effects of se@@ amed se@@ amed se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems ana@@ emia suffered , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to se@@ amed were kept in the same measure as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of an enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , constant mig@@ rant head@@ ache and turbul@@ ence .
Ab@@ se@@ amed should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa or any of the other components .

the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients , where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should lie .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall illness ; therefore , the evaluation of individual clinical trial and disease condition is required by the physician .
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient via or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dosage , which is required for the control of ana@@ emia and the angi@@ oma symptoms .
these clinical results indicate that patients with initial very low pH value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial ana@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

symptoms and consequences may vary depending on age , gender and overall illness ; therefore , the evaluation of individual clinical trial and disease condition is required by the physician .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

patients with mild ana@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood con@@ duction is required should be received in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure .
the iron substitu@@ tion should be started as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available before the se@@ amed therapy begins .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg Ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly over three weeks ( Day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of intervention ( day 0 ) .
in this case , ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa should be given pre @-@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a f@@ ist@@ le , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine into circulation .
patients receiving treatment with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in on er@@ y@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ op@@ enia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive se@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ op@@ enia ) .

in patients en@@ vis@@ aged for a larger elec@@ tive orth@@ op@@ edic procedure and which can not participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is contr@@ ain@@ dic@@ ated in the following advantages , accompanying or oral diseases , peri@@ ph@@ ere arter@@ ial vas@@ cular disease , vas@@ cular disease of the car@@ ot@@ oti@@ des or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ; in patients with recently inserted heart attack or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular event .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ op@@ enia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare has been reported about the occurrence of an anti@@ co@@ ated PR@@ CA after mon@@ th@@ - to years @-@ long treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in .
in patients with sudden loss of effect , defined as reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes for non @-@ speaking ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminum oxide tox@@ ic@@ ation , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ ol@@ y@@ sis ) are examined .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , considering an@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes &quot; index &quot; ) , is hum@@ ili@@ ated ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / mic@@ rol@@ iter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the plat@@ el@@ ets and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ y@@ tes are normal , and if no other cause of an active loss is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row will be considered to be diagnosed with a PR@@ CA .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ icity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti@@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In case of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency patients should not exceed the upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 .
in clinical studies an increased mort@@ ality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular inci@@ dents were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stim@@ ulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have demonstrated no significant benefit that is due to the administration of ep@@ et@@ ines when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for the control of the symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise should amount to about 1 g / dl ( 0.62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ gest@@ ive in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentrations should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to recent findings , the treatment of ana@@ emia with ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
tumour patients with chemotherapy should be considered a 2 - 3 week delay between ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa administration and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in response ( patients who may have to be trans@@ acted ) for the evaluation of the treatment effectiveness of ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa .
if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see Section 4.2 Treat@@ ment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therapies with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction based on the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients en@@ vis@@ aged for a larger elec@@ tive orth@@ op@@ edic procedure , if possible , prior to the beginning of the ep@@ o@@ et@@ in al@@ fa therapy , the cause of ana@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly .
patients who undergo a greater elec@@ tive orth@@ op@@ a@@ edic procedure should receive adequate thro@@ mb@@ lo@@ sis pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular diseases , particularly in a underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa for patients with an initial hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl , an increased risk for post@@ operative thro@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cular events can pers@@ ist .
in several controlled trials , ep@@ et@@ ins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic ana@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer received chemotherapy , when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is applied together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ do@@ sis should be adjusted to the increasing hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit .
there are no indications of an interaction between ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
about thro@@ mb@@ otic , vas@@ cular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial im@@ pe@@ aches , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events ( cer@@ eb@@ ral circulation , brain inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , an@@ eur@@ y@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial nose was reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in treatment , so also patients under ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased inci@@ dence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in treatment it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated ble@@ eding to thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular complications .
the gene@@ tically won ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and in relation to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate proportion is identical to the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ abolic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa specifically stim@@ ulates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ oc@@ ese .

survival and progression of tumour were examined in five large controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine patients and the control patient .
in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in treated patients with an ana@@ emia due to several common mal@@ ign@@ omas consistent , statist@@ ically significantly higher mort@@ ality than in controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the inci@@ dence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cal events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl since too few patients with these characteristics included in the reviewed data .
ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa provisions following repeated intrav@@ en@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy subjects and a somewhat prolonged half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um levels of ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um mirrors , which are achieved after intrav@@ en@@ ous inj@@ ections .
there are no cum@@ ulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .

in case you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ op@@ enia , it will break your therapy with se@@ amed and determine how your ana@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intrav@@ en@@ ous ) if you are treated because of ana@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value can be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of elevated or increasing pot@@ assi@@ um mirrors your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of treatment with se@@ amed until the pot@@ assi@@ um values are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic ren@@ al weakness and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ gest@@ ion by in@@ adequate heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present knowledge , the treatment of blood im@@ pover@@ ishment with abor@@ tion in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa @-@ offering and the desired effect should be taken into account for assess@@ ing the effectiveness of se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of red blood @-@ dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose to minimize the risk of thro@@ mb@@ rop@@ hic formation ( thro@@ mb@@ otic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully against the benefits derived from the treatment with ep@@ o@@ et@@ in al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk for oste@@ o@@ otic vas@@ cular events , e.g. if you have already occurred oste@@ o@@ otic vas@@ cular events ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ osis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
if you are cancer patient , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed act as a growth factor for blood cells and may under certain circumstances affect the tumor adver@@ sely .
if a larger orth@@ op@@ a@@ edic surgery is imm@@ in@@ ent , the cause of your ana@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the treatment begins .
if your values of the red blood @-@ dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed as there is an increased risk of blood graf@@ ting after surgery .
please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently been used / used , even if it is not prescription drugs .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with se@@ amed , your doctor may possibly arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory studies have no interaction between ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are means for building the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on your blood im@@ balance ( ana@@ emia ) respon@@ ds to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will possibly arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value .
once you are well adjusted , you receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , distributed over two equally large inj@@ ections .

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ tures ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who have recently suffered a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture like the H@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et des Kno@@ chens , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first inf@@ usion .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after inf@@ usion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ asta .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included two 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who have recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies on a total of 357 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) for six months .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzy@@ me that builds bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline value .
in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures was reduced by 70 % in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatments ) over a period of three years .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatments ) .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of the patients under A@@ cl@@ asta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 by 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less frequent with repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or other constitu@@ ents .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ onate patients , patients at A@@ cl@@ asta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the inf@@ usion point and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis ( dying of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta provides information for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ asta for treating oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the drug side effects are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men an intrav@@ en@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended once a year .
for patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture the administration of the inf@@ usion of a@@ cl@@ er@@ xes is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of hip frac@@ tures ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et with A@@ cl@@ asta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et a sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of element@@ ar calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ asta inf@@ usion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days following the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by means of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ asta .
patients with ren@@ al dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended because there are limited clinical experiences for this patient group .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination in older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolesc@@ ents A@@ cl@@ asta are not recommended for use in children and adolesc@@ ents under 18 years of age , since data are ab@@ sent to harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended for patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is treated before beginning of therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid deployment of the effect of cit@@ ric acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et a sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of element@@ ar calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( poor oral hygiene ) should be considered a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment before using bis@@ phosph@@ onate .
for patients who require dental intervention , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ onate reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ itis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by means of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the inci@@ dence of wor@@ sen@@ ing cases of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation in cases of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0,6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ ZON - Recur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2,6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function distur@@ ban@@ ces , which expressed itself as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( measured before the administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure as well as a limited kidney function were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ atine within 10 days of offering was observed at 1.8 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 0.8 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal sw@@ elling range ( less than 2.10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , were compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et trials .
all patients received supple@@ mentary sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial was reported via local reactions to the inf@@ usion point , such as red@@ ness , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0,7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ics in the jaw area , especially in cancer patients , over oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) , reported cases that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ onate , including c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ opor@@ itis , and the majority of reports referring to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention .
7 study of 7,@@ 736 patients performed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in a jaw area with an A@@ cl@@ asta and a plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patient .
in the case of an over@@ dose which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intrav@@ en@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 2,5 with or without any signs of an existing verteb@@ ral body structure .
effects on morph@@ omet@@ ric cardi@@ ac frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after a year the frequency of one or several new verteb@@ ral body structures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a reduced risk of spinal body frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta had a constant effect over three years which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in one by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar verteb@@ rate , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to the plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the th@@ igh h@@ ash by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic ridge .
a micro@@ computer@@ ised tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume compared to plac@@ ebo and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone substitute mark@@ ers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ p of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were specified in sub @-@ groups from 517 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the duration of the study .
the treatment with an annual dose of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta reduced B@@ SAP in 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was reduced significantly by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was reduced significantly by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before inf@@ usion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the HOR@@ I@@ ZON @-@ RF@@ T study increased the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment compared to plac@@ ebo treatment compared to plac@@ ebo treatment at all times .
the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment took over 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment to increase BM@@ D by 5.4 % at the overall level and 4.3 % at the fem@@ oral neck .
clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ ZON @-@ RF@@ T study , 508 men were random@@ ised and 185 patients evaluated the BM@@ D after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , the once weekly administration of A@@ cl@@ asta was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the bone A@@ cl@@ asta was examined in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ological confirmed , above all light to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the bone ( mean ser@@ um @-@ mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ fold to 3.0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when recording into the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg of cit@@ ric acid in comparison to intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months has been proven in two six months comparison studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six month main study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ asta and the 107 patients with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study could maintain the therapeutic response at 141 of patients with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared to 71 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , during an average duration of follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ off and multiple 5 @-@ 15 minutes lasting inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ ed independently .
then the plasma bar quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ phase dis@@ appearance from the large circulation system with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β am@@ ate@@ ways , followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a termin@@ ale elim@@ ination time t ½ γ 146 hours .
the early stages ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys .
in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the given dose can be found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration vs. time ) .
reduced Clear@@ ance by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzy@@ me @-@ enzy@@ me met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or not direct and / or ir@@ reversible , material @-@ changing inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ atine @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ atine @-@ Clear@@ ance , and amounted to 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range from 22 to 143 ml / min ) in 64 patients .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an excessive ren@@ al dysfunction down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance up to 35 ml / min requires no dose adjustment of the c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
since for severe kidney dysfunction ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ let@@ al intrav@@ en@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C were the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administ@@ ered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub @-@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity In studies with intrav@@ en@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats was administ@@ ered in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose , equivalent to the 6@@ fold of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , corresponding to the AU@@ C , corresponding to the AU@@ C , corresponds to ) , well toler@@ ated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , tox@@ ic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs , including gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as intrav@@ en@@ ous inj@@ ections .
the most common finding in trials with repeated application was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ se of long bones for animals in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance .
at rats one observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity of doses from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ normal@@ ities and such a skel@@ eton .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub @-@ punching class called bis@@ phosph@@ onate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease Pag@@ et des Kno@@ chens .
decre@@ asing blood levels of sex hormones , mainly est@@ ro@@ gens made of andro@@ gens , play a role in the rather grad@@ ual loss of bone mass observed in men .
at the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et the bone structure takes place too fast , and new bone @-@ material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
A@@ cl@@ asta acts by norm@@ alising the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus gives again strength to the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ asta .
when using A@@ cl@@ asta with other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you are taking other medicines / apply or have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription drugs .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs from which it is known that they damage the kid@@ neys .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public assessment report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Use Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reviewed the studies conducted to make recommendations on the application of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , where met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ abe@@ tic medication ) is not indicated . • It can be applied together with another di@@ abe@@ tic medication ( dual therapy ) .
it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , which cannot be satis@@ factory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dosage .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or ins@@ ulin , the current dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or ins@@ ulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ ph@@ onic resin or ins@@ ulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s ins@@ ulin can be better utilized and the blood glu@@ cose level decreases , allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood glu@@ cose levels were reduced in application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins decreased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of plac@@ ebo led to a decrease of 0.35 % .
in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin was studied in 289 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin have reduced the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ an@@ esth@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stim@@ uli ) .
Ac@@ tos should not be used in patients who may react very sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or other components in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ abe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ( high level of ket@@ one - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with met@@ form@@ in .
in October 2000 , the European Commission approved Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the marketing of accounts in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to white , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the wording &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination of ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate with ins@@ ulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contr@@ ain@@ dic@@ ations or int@@ oler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
for use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , so the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients suffering from at least a risk factor ( e.g. early heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ de@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and e@@ de@@ ma when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was performed .
Euromonitor International has over 30 years experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
in patients with increased output liver enzy@@ me ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzy@@ me values are as soon as possible to control .
if a patient develops symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , fatigue , loss of appet@@ ite and / or dar@@ ker urine , are the liver enzy@@ me values to be checked .
the decision , whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , should be led by the clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are submitted .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can be stir@@ red by fatty deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction of middle hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ative controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and to a lesser extent also in patients under Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
as a result of increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity in patients receiving pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as oral two @-@ fold or triple combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the launch , the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d indi@@ cons , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , was reported on a occurrence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ abe@@ tic mac@@ ular e@@ de@@ ma with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ de@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ de@@ ma when patients report about disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; an appropriate ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on
the calculated frac@@ ture inci@@ dence was 1.9 Fra@@ ktur for 100 patient @-@ years in patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1,1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years of cardiovascular inci@@ dence , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared with 23 / 905 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or does this , the treatment is to be depos@@ ited ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not have any relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with pharmaceu@@ ticals that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8- In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ indu@@ cted ) resulted in a reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia resulting in pregnancy and increased the availability of the met@@ abolic substr@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( from this data not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ um and the re@@ fraction of the lens , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ Anst@@ ie@@ ge frequently appeared on the triangle of the upper limit of the normal range , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins .
in an outcome study in patients with advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , the inci@@ dence of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency was 1.6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo if pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or respectively .
since its introduction , it has rarely been reported on cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , but more frequently when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
there was a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in patients with compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in the study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared with 23 / 905 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day more than seven days , no symptoms appeared .
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to be activated by activ@@ ating specific rec@@ ept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome prolifer@@ ation ) , which leads to increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ cose production in the liver and increases the peripher@@ al glu@@ cose level in the case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years in order to investigate the time until progression of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the therapy a blood glu@@ cose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the patients treated ( compared to 50 % of the patients below Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequate despite a three @-@ month optimization phase with ins@@ ulin was random@@ ised to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo .
in patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the medium H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.45 % compared to those who received ins@@ ulin only ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on showed a statist@@ ically significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 week study of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tic patients .
in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel , as well as a minor , however , clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ de azi@@ de .
compared to plac@@ ebo , there was no statist@@ ically significant increase in L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , while under met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d decreased values were observed .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 5@@ 238 patients were random@@ ised in groups with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease in groups who received either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in plasma usually reach 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to efficacy in approximately three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8- In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ indu@@ cted ) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ active Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in humans , the marker was found mainly in the waste ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elim@@ ination duration of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites is lower in patients with reduced ren@@ al function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance of the mother substance are similar .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , ana@@ emia and re@@ versi@@ bly ec@@ centric cardi@@ ac hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one dimin@@ ishes the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the mother animal and thus reduces the availability of the met@@ abolic substr@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased inci@@ dences of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) were induced by the ur@@ inary bladder epithel@@ ium .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ po@@ sis ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d indi@@ ans resulted in increased inci@@ dence of col@@ ont@@ al tum@@ ours .

the calculated frac@@ ture inci@@ dence was 1.9 Fra@@ ktur for 100 patient @-@ years in patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1,1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years of cardiovascular inci@@ dence , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared with 23 / 905 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were investigated .
in clinical trials over 1 year , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on showed a statist@@ ically significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values .
in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both through an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and the ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ d synthesis .

Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane was examined in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pan@@ cre@@ as can &apos;t produce ins@@ ulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to effectively use ins@@ ulin .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , pointing out that the blood glu@@ cose levels were lo@@ wered similarly to another human ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
moreover , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administ@@ ered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the prescription label ) .
the Committee on Human Use Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ af@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes were ou@@ tw@@ eigh@@ ed to the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission approved Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to grant approval for the marketing of Ac@@ tr@@ af@@ ane in the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed ins@@ ulin products are usually applied once or twice daily if a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood glu@@ cose level has improved significantly due to an intensi@@ fied ins@@ ulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms can be altered and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , ins@@ ulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ phase , long acting ins@@ ulin , etc . ) , type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin , human ins@@ ulin or ins@@ ulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against ins@@ ulin origin ) may cause a change in dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ t@@ aph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human ins@@ ulin , reported that early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous ins@@ ulin .
before travelling , which pass over several time zones , the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his doctor , as such journeys can cause ins@@ ulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in therapy and always consult his patients with other medicines taken by them .

di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grape @-@ sugar@@ s , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cu@@ its or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias involving un@@ consciousness are treated with an intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a designated aid person or by glu@@ cose which is given intrav@@ en@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of the activity is up to 24 hours .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
moreover , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may be adapted if it is administ@@ ered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S company a permit for the marketing of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in the European Union .
when two types of ins@@ ulin are mixed , the amount of ins@@ ulin @-@ acting ins@@ ulin first needs to be raised , then the amount of ins@@ ulin @-@ acting ins@@ ulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .

A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of crystalline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or g@@ out no@@ des ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. larger urine crystalline deposits which may lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , there may still occur g@@ out attacks , so it is recommended that patients at least during the first six months under treatment with A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic are still taking other medicines to prevent g@@ out attacks .
the medicine is not recommended for children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once a day 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do drugs ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( once a day 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 762 patients each year with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels were in the blood during the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who took A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) patients who once daily took 120 mg once daily , in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and ab@@ normal liver values .
in particular in patients with heart complaints in the pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Human Use Committee ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic could be more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases which have already led to urine deposits ( including one from the patient &apos;s history known or currently available g@@ out node and / or arthritis ) .
if the ser@@ um acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be considered to A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 times a day .
in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been completely examined ( cre@@ atine clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolesc@@ ents There are no experiences in children and adolesc@@ ents , the use of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group .
organ transplan@@ t recep@@ tor Sin@@ ce there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the use of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease If patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compression heart failure are not recommended , treatment is not recommended with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other har@@ ic @-@ growing pharmaceu@@ ticals , there may be an acute g@@ out attack during the treatment course , because by lowering the ser@@ um resin acid , ur@@ ic acid deposits can first be mobili@@ zed in the tissue .
B. for mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ - Ny@@ han &apos;s syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing Phase 3 clinical studies , slight col@@ lu@@ tions of liver function values were observed in patients with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before beginning of February and continue in the course of clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ war did not have an exchange rate studies on Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition could lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( a in@@ hibition of the metabolism of The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ ors ) .
at Pro@@ ban@@ den , the simultaneous offering of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 times a day associated with an increase in February ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ in@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or at the same time used other active ingredient .
in a study with study subjects , 120 mg A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 medium , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzy@@ me in vi@@ vo .
ant@@ acid It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of an ant@@ acid , which contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , ret@@ arded the absorption of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ ancies do not include side effects of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect harm to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can be reasonably confident that A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC did not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher inci@@ dence of cardiovascular inci@@ dence was observed in Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1,4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statist@@ ically significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors detected in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ kl@@ erotic illness and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the patient &apos;s history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects , which could arise in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Feb@@ . at more than once reported , are listed below .
di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ ine . * * In clinical trials , no severe r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 322 patients up to 2 years long , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
treatment @-@ related events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all February treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patients ) , according to the indications , occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 for these doses or with a smaller frequency :
diabetes , hyper@@ li@@ pi@@ d@@ emia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hyp@@ a@@ esth@@ esia , con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous EC@@ G , cou@@ gh , smoo@@ th@@ ness , skin irrit@@ ation , kidney failure , kidney failure , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in the blood , increase in pot@@ assi@@ um concentration in the blood , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , decrease in the number of white blood cells .
reaction mechanism ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ in@@ met@@ ry in humans and results in the reaction process hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is a powerful non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vit@@ ro @-@ hem@@ ming that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area .
clinical study results The efficacy of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies in Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1.8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study the proportion of patients with which the last three month @-@ specific ser@@ um acid levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 267 ) , A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um incre@@ at@@ in@@ ate to study starts of &gt; 1,5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed the statist@@ ically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg . 1 times daily as well as with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg . 1 times daily compared to the treatment with conventi@@ onally used doses of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statist@@ ically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg . 1 times daily as well as with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg . 1 times daily compared to the treatment with the conventi@@ onally used dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with ser@@ um @-@ at@@ in@@ ate values &gt; 1,5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were summar@@ ized for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.001 versus 80 mg
lowering the ser@@ um resin acid to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed in the doctor visit in week 2 and maintained over the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um @-@ at@@ in@@ ate values &gt; 1,5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( d . h .
with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 times daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 times daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to the percentage revers@@ al of ser@@ um @-@ acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney dysfunction ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um resin acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed that less than 3 % of patients required 16 @-@ 24 treatment against a delay ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a delay ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the g@@ out node size , which in 54 % of the patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of the g@@ out no@@ des up to month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - Val@@ ues ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also received in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) increased from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportional .
doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at an increase in AU@@ C , which is larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simpler or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg . 1 times daily , the C@@ max amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage reduction of ser@@ um resin concentrations , if this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at lies between 29 and 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma cut binding of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to approx . 99.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vit@@ ro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C8 or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ vre @-@ glu@@ cur@@ oni@@ d origin@@ ates mainly from U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ selected Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at about 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ modified Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , Ac@@ yl@@ glu@@ cur@@ oni@@ d of the active ingredient ( 30 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ jug@@ ates ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose was found in the chair as un@@ modified Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , Ac@@ yl@@ glu@@ cur@@ oni@@ d of the active ingredient ( 1 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ jug@@ ates ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups kidney failure after taking multiple doses of 80 mg of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function .
the mean total AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased about 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ g ⋅ h / ml in group with normal kidney function at 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver function limit@@ ing after taking multiple doses of 80 mg of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- p@@ ugh classification B ) or moderate ( Child @-@ P@@ ugh classification B ) liver function restriction changes the C@@ max and AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , imp@@ air@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statist@@ ically significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ors ( trans@@ itional cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas ) were found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , with approximately 11 times the exposure to humans .
these findings are considered as a result of specialised purple met@@ abo@@ lization and urine composition , and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that Feb@@ ost@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproduction performance of male and female rats .
in high doses , which were approximately 4 @-@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal Tox@@ icity occurred , the associated with a reduction of the breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which are approximately 4.3 times and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which are about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , have no ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ in@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or at the same time used other active ingredient .

according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine , an updated R@@ MP is to be submitted to risk management systems for medical devices with the next peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SUR ) .
in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • if new information is available , which have an impact on the safety data , the pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities for risk com@@ posting • within 60 days after reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ anz or risk management ) • on request of the E@@ MEA
in some people ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ sol@@ uble .
if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration low by the 1 x daily intake of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC , the formation of the crystals is prevented and in this way a reduction of dis@@ comfort is achieved with time .
A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC may not be taken , if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC .
inform your doctor before you begin taking this medication , • if you have a cardi@@ ac weakness or have or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you are treated due to high ur@@ ic acid concentration as a result of cancer illness or the Les@@ ch Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disease in which too much ur@@ ic acid is found in the blood ) .
if you have a g@@ out attack at the moment ( sudden appearance of severe pain , sensitivity , red@@ ness , heat sensation and joint sw@@ elling ) , wait until the attack is cleared before you start treatment with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC .
this does not have to be with everyone , but may also occur with you , especially during the first treatment weeks or - months , when you take A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC .
your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines to you if necessary to treat a g@@ out attack or to treat the symptoms associated with it ( such as pain and joint sw@@ elling ) .
please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently been used / used , even if it is not prescription drugs .
it is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking drugs / apply one of the following substances , as interactions with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC may occur and your doctor may want to consider necessary measures . • The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in ( for the treatment of as@@ thma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood di@@ lution in heart disease )
no studies have been carried out on the effects of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC on the imper@@ me@@ ability and ability to operate machinery .
therefore , please take A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC after consultation with your doctor if you know that you suffer from int@@ oler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is used for treating oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause where there is a risk of a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , the patient may not lie until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already separately used in pharmaceu@@ ticals that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data from earlier studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE were lower ( 11 % ) than those who took Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data that show that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dosage contained in AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is exactly the dose needed to prevent a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal disorders ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digest@@ ive apparatus such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , ul@@ c@@ ul@@ ence ( ul@@ cer@@ ation ) , ul@@ c@@ ers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , tum@@ ul@@ atory abdom@@ en ( blocked stomach ) as well as acid distur@@ b@@ ance .
in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( all@@ ergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE cannot be applied .
it should not be applied in case of diseases of the es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand up or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a permit for the marketing of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE in the European Union .
capsule shaped , white to broken white tablets , characterized by the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .

• At the end of the day AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE should only be swal@@ lowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not che@@ w the tablet or put the tablet in the mouth as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a occurs . • The patients should not sit before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. p@@ ept@@ al ul@@ c@@ ers , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , except for p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , are given only under special cau@@ tion ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ oph@@ age@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , es@@ oph@@ age@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ oph@@ age@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ oph@@ age@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partially these severe and required a hospital instruction ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible mal@@ ign@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to reduce symptoms of es@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ star pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine and seek medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of serious es@@ oph@@ age@@ al side @-@ effects seems to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an es@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ o@@ den@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis of the jaw , usually related to a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ opor@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regim@@ en mostly administ@@ ered intrav@@ en@@ ously administ@@ ered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available to indicate whether the use of bis@@ phosph@@ onate therapy in patients with a sh@@ ale surgical procedure decreases the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapeutic planning of each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that they should take the dose of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE after taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets on the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idal melan@@ in ) should also be treated adequ@@ ately before beginning of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can imp@@ air the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate if taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither used during pregnancy nor of l@@ act@@ ating women .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no indication of directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ onate ; most reports origin@@ ate from cancer patients , but also for oste@@ opor@@ osis patients it was reported .
nevertheless the ser@@ um cal@@ ci@@ um decreased to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2,0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ate to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ( 0.65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at &apos;s sequence of oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach up@@ set , heart@@ burn , ec@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , gast@@ ritis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at The therapeutic equi@@ val@@ ence of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at once a week 70 mg ( n = 519 ) and Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was detected in a one @-@ year mul@@ tic@@ enter study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture inci@@ dence in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 944 ) as well as in the Fra@@ ktur @-@ Study ( F@@ IT : n = 6,@@ 459 ) .
in phase III studies , the mean incl@@ ines of the BM@@ D with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate amounted to 8.8 % / day compared to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.8 % at the spine , 5.9 % in fem@@ ur and 7.8 % at the tro@@ user .
in the group treated with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 3.2 % compared to plac@@ ebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the climb@@ s of the BM@@ D of verteb@@ ral column and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to maintain ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the whole body was maintained .
it consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and afterwards 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily administration of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the occurrence of at least a new verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption Based on intrav@@ en@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in women &apos;s 0.64 % for doses between 5 and 70 m@@ g. after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
the bio@@ availability declined accordingly to approximately 0.46 % and 0.39 % when Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken at least half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day .
in healthy subjects the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) lead to no clin@@ ically significant alter@@ ation of oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies of rats have shown that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is temporarily distributed in soft tissue tissues after intrav@@ en@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly re@@ distributed in the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intrav@@ en@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ end@@ ron@@ at about 50 % of the radio@@ active substance were ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the com@@ part@@ ments .
after intrav@@ en@@ ous dosage of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and the system@@ ic Clear@@ ance was not 200 ml / min .
in rats , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the aci@@ dic or alkal@@ ine transport system of kid@@ neys and therefore it is not assumed that in humans the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines is affected by these transport systems .

the average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the cases after 4 days 4.9 % .
characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , which is not depos@@ ited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine .
although there are no clinical data on it , however , it is expected that the ren@@ al elim@@ ination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate as in animal testing will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , in patients with reduced ren@@ al function , a somewhat higher accumulation of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in bones is expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is administ@@ ered to adult patients , who have been transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver to prevent the immune rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , comparing the application of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f with Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with whom the transplan@@ t was graded after a year of treatment ( for example exam@@ ining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a resu@@ mption of the di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , recent studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation have been carried out and examined how Adv@@ oc@@ ra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or an increased inci@@ dence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a change to alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains .
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level requirements ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ d@@ ations &quot; )
after switching from Pro@@ graf to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test mirrors should be checked before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
day 4 was the system@@ ic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , with both form@@ ulations in both kidney and liver transplan@@ t patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ oc@@ ross to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ tation phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f D@@ os@@ is@@ scheme can take several days until the ste@@ ady state is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition does not permit oral consumption of medicines in the first post@@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus therapy can be initiated intrav@@ en@@ ously ( Pro@@ graf 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application For the supp@@ ression of the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ t rep@@ ulsion The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
other dose adjustments may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the stabi@@ lization of the patient following the transplan@@ t .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ t rep@@ ulsion The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - change from Pro@@ graf to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be converted from Pro@@ graf capsules to a daily dose of Pro@@ graf capsules once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , so this conversion has to be done in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , based on the total daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for the pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection is recommended once a day .
transplan@@ tation In case of adult patients , which are converted to adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in lung , pan@@ cre@@ atic and intest@@ ine @-@ transplan@@ ted patients , occurred in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0,15 mg / kg / day , in pan@@ cre@@ atic @-@ transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function In order to maintain blood tal@@ low in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver dysfunction .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ in levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , cau@@ tion is required ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the descent of the general blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases , under the assistance of thorough@@ bred @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ spiegel @-@ controls .
it is recommended to perform common checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test levels during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood Tal@@ king of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ graf to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , dosage adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy or for simultaneous use of substances , which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus complete blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adap@@ tations of the dose may need several days until the ste@@ ady state has occurred .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels of the tal@@ ons do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the descent of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in the case of gl@@ ul@@ ting and heart @-@ transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which can occur in a sequence of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be effective against other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
for pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients in the child age , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
because of possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ cular levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements which contain cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other herbal remedies during treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concentrations in the blood is provided as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , a chamber or sep@@ tum @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ oc@@ ephal@@ y .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , liquid over@@ load and ecology .
as with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , the effects of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sun protection using a high protection factor .
if patients taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ ache , altered states of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f Hart@@ capsules , ret@@ arded , l@@ act@@ ose included , special cau@@ tion is required in patients with rare her@@ edit@@ ary gal@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glu@@ cose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of drugs or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore advisable to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - blood levels in simultaneous dispens@@ ing of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A met@@ abolic rate and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain even better concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was with anti@@ fung@@ al agents such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole , and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole , as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics have reported that the increase in blood levels is mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal metabolism .
high @-@ dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus drugs is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibition ; therefore , the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed with drugs that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus will desc@@ end the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thereby increase the hormone exposition , it is particularly careful when making decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal testing have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and prolon@@ gs its half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients do not suggest that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , compared to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born on possible harmful effects of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially concerning its effect on the kid@@ neys ) is recommended .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ emia of the new@@ born ( inci@@ dence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side @-@ acting profile of immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants often cannot be found precisely because of the patient &apos;s underlying disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
in the following , side effects are listed according to their frequency in desc@@ ending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) .

it was reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ op@@ las@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours associated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ si@@ able .
mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ olic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for en@@ rich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duc@@ tions in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymph@@ oma genes .

published results of primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of Pro@@ graf capsules after other primary organ transplan@@ tation Pro@@ graf has developed into a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ant after pan@@ cre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplan@@ tation .
175 lun@@ gen@@ transplan@@ t patients , in 475 patients who had under@@ gone a pan@@ cre@@ atic transplan@@ t and used in 630 cases after an intestinal transplan@@ t as primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ graf in these published studies reviewed the observ@@ ations in the large studies where Pro@@ graf was used for primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression in the Pro@@ graf in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recent , multi @-@ centric study with oral Pro@@ graf was reported more than 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
also a chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ ch@@ ol@@ itis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was less frequently observed in the first year after transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus there was 21.@@ 7 % of cases in the formation of bron@@ ch@@ ol@@ itis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 38.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients that were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection , was after 6 months ( 57,@@ 7 % versus 45.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in the lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ splan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) .
in a study the frequency of the formation of bron@@ ch@@ ol@@ itis ob@@ liter@@ ates was significantly lower with the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pan@@ cre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multi @-@ centric trial with oral Pro@@ graf was performed on 205 patients who received a pan@@ cre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ t that were random@@ ised in Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached after reaching the target levels of 8 to 15 ng / ml at 5 .
intestinal transplan@@ tation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral Pro@@ graf as primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ant after colo@@ rec@@ tal transplan@@ ts showed a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit@@ es and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the dis@@ band@@ ed faction of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a gain of metabolism induced by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , should be responsible for the higher clear@@ ance rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this allows tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to be almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly via the bile .
in stable patients that were converted from Pro@@ graf ( twice a day ) to Adv@@ oc@@ ra@@ f ( once a day ) in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ graf .
it is recommended to perform common checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test levels during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be effective against other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , liquid over@@ load and ecology .

advoc@@ ate is used to treat and prevent ble@@ eding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( a blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder due to the lack of factor VIII ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application are aimed at whether advoc@@ ates are used for the treatment of ble@@ eding or for prevention of ble@@ eding in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor of VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots like ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to em@@ power it to the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is otherwise produced , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined for prevention of ble@@ eding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the effectiveness of advoc@@ ates in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ iso@@ des was &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .

dosage : dosage and duration of substitu@@ tion therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII deficiency , according to the location and extent of blood supply and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity in the appropriate period should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk is pre@@ valent for the patient .
during the treatment course , a proper determination of the factor VIII plasma bar is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ life times .
3 Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of ble@@ eding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor of VIII plasma activities is not reached or if the blood is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to verify an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the dosage speed should be directed according to the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII directed by Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure stage is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure times and an@@ am@@ nest@@ ically known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the recur@@ r@@ ence of ( low tit@@ bits ) inhibit@@ ors is observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about applying factor VIII during pregnancy and l@@ act@@ ation .
the A@@ DR@@ s inhibit@@ ors were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who showed a higher risk of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data not estim@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated by the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected fall of the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VIII @-@ mirrors occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ operative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE inf@@ usion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained during the whole time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values again on the 15 post@@ operative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults , 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) showed only one patient after 26 ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ ATE a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , in none of the 53 pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate he@@ at@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or was established .
in previously untreated patients with ongoing clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) were treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of contamin@@ ating proteins was analyzed by investig@@ ating the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statist@@ ically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of anti@@ body anti@@ body protein against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms resulting in an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were reported to report about the appearance of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ er gran@@ u@@ lo@@ y@@ tes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .

based on the data available since initial approval , CH@@ MP continued to consider the benefit risk mit@@ igation as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , so that the fil@@ ing owner should apply for another extension within five years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited distributed the Committee for Human Use Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company re@@ jects its application for the marketing of an Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissues that connect other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and supports ) are affected .
it is a type of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been modified so that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger any infection in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene that is not def@@ ective in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , with which the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of under@@ mining , bone and brain .
after the CH@@ MP test@@ ified the answers of the company to the questions asked , some questions were still un@@ clear .
based on the review of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP will generate a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in brings benefits to patients in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i .
the committee also concerns concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine .
in addition , the company has not sufficiently proved that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not notice the CH@@ MP whether the return has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed active release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective ingredients will be released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ ina@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal r@@ hin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever , caused by an all@@ ergy to pol@@ len induced inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cosa ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and yo@@ ung@@ sters aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of aer@@ os@@ ol is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cosa ( c@@ logged nose ) , are sub@@ kl@@ ed .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the block@@ age of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the degree of sever@@ ity of h@@ ay fever symptoms , which were reported by the patients before the treatment begins and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients wor@@ e their symptoms every 12 hours in a di@@ ary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hypo@@ cris@@ y symptoms , except the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose , the patients who took aer@@ os@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.@@ 0 % , compared with 35.@@ 9 % in the patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cosa was considered , patients among Aer@@ ina@@ ze showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ ina@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart failure ) , mou@@ th@@ lessness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , const@@ ip@@ ation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ ina@@ ze may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another drug for treating allergi@@ es ) .
aer@@ ina@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a lid glau@@ coma ( elevated level of intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart or vas@@ cular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id gland ) , or already have a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by brain ble@@ eding ) or have a risk of a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission approved the SP Europe agreement for the marketing of aer@@ in@@ ars across the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without dis@@ bit@@ ing , cr@@ acking or che@@ wing ) .
aer@@ ina@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after finishing the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the use time to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with time .
after the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory system , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ on@@ ze contains Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , the medicine is also contr@@ ain@@ dic@@ ated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ one@@ tic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as Bro@@ mo@@ crip@@ it@@ in , Per@@ go@@ eyel@@ id , Er@@ got@@ amin , Di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other Dek@@ on@@ gest@@ iva , which are used per@@ ally or nas@@ al as a sw@@ elling r@@ hin@@ ology ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , oxy@@ me@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient collective and the data do not suff@@ ice to pronoun@@ ce appropriate recommendations for dosing .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ os@@ ins were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suff@@ ice to pronoun@@ ce appropriate recommendations for dosing .
patients must be informed that treating hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or palm@@ ettes , heart rhythm disorders , nau@@ sea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be depos@@ ited .
in the treatment of the following patient groups , cau@@ tion is recommended : • Pati@@ ents with cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ant in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck , or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asm in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ ina@@ ze must be depos@@ ited at least 48 hours prior to the implementation of der@@ mat@@ ological tests as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent .
in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administ@@ ered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test , no significant differences could be found between the patients with the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone or with alcohol was taken .
the enzy@@ me responsible for metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in does not in@@ hibit in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 drug does not in@@ hibit and neither a substr@@ ate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein is .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ ars during pregnancy is not assured , however , experiences from a large number of affected pregnant women did not increase the frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since re@@ productive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ ical properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ ars should not be used in pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases , there may be a da@@ zz@@ lement that may result in imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic noise or ability to serve machines .
symptoms can vary between a CN@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ NS stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible letters .
head@@ ache , anxiety , fri@@ ght@@ ful dispos@@ ition , muscle weakness , and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as , thir@@ st , tran@@ spiration , nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , im@@ pedi@@ at@@ ric pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , hyper@@ tension , hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
a Z@@ NS stimulation is most likely in children as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ wash , pup@@ illary and dil@@ ation , skin red@@ ness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on sm@@ ol@@ ek@@ ü@@ ls P @-@ sel@@ ect@@ in to endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess was observed in the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day compared to plac@@ ebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause other sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
there were 1.@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal r@@ hin@@ itis , with 414 patients receiving aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets , determined by the total co@@ res for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cosa ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets with regard to the sw@@ elling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cosa , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of A@@ ina@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation .
as part of a single dose study for the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ ina@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the application in the plasma .
the body weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached on day 10 after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ ars in healthy subjects over 14 days .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose case study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet on healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in po@@ or@@ ly metabol@@ ised .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine according to the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was bio@@ equivalent to exposure to the gift of an aer@@ ar tablet .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in cannot detect any particular dangers to humans .
the combination possessed no greater tox@@ icity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the substance pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .
in re@@ productive tox@@ ic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic in doses of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
the pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ ance system described in March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to alle@@ vi@@ ating allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , its effect .

it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 M@@ g@@ - Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for in@@ gest@@ ing ( sol@@ uble tablets ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup tablets ( tablets , which can be dissolved in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children between one and five years , the dose is 1,25 mg once daily , which in the form of 2,5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively .
for children between six and eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies with about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolesc@@ ents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four studies of seasonal r@@ hin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness has been measured by investig@@ ating the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ran@@ s , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment .
further studies were presented to demonstrate that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for intake and the mel@@ ting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use in children is harm@@ less .
in allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of ac@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in the two trials at Ur@@ tic@@ aria the decrease of the symptom was after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; January 2001 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe agreement to grant asylum in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms in allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials to improve the use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease progression and may termin@@ ate after the symptoms of the symptoms and resu@@ me their recur@@ r@@ ence .
the persist@@ ing allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to the patient during the all@@ ergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administ@@ ered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness which may result in imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic noise or ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in different indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 578 adol@@ es@@ cent patients aged 12 to 17 , the most common side effect was head@@ ache , this occurred at 5.9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and 6.9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( ninet@@ een clinical dose ) were administ@@ ered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P @-@ sel@@ ect@@ in to endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was administ@@ ered daily over 14 days , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administ@@ ered over ten days showed no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose @-@ dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear , and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and persist@@ ing allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall co@@ res of the questionn@@ aire to the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ished the burden caused by seasonal r@@ hin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of the eti@@ ology , is similar to the different forms , and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited pro@@ spec@@ tively .
as hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ inary disorders , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in also results in other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic I@@ di@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria the minority of patients not responded to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study .
an improvement of the it@@ chin@@ ess by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in compared to 19 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and vig@@ il@@ ence as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal r@@ hin@@ itis population , 4 % of patients had reached a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
there are no cl@@ ues for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzy@@ me responsible for metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 drug is in@@ hibited and neither a substr@@ ate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
in a single dose case study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
the pre@@ clinical studies conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the tox@@ icity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in cannot detect any particular dangers to humans .

an@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms in allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis will be caused by infection in children under 2 years ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data exists that support a treatment of a inf@@ ectious r@@ hin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in diagn@@ osing the ana@@ esth@@ esia .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and experiencing higher levels of substitu@@ tion ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to those with children who are normal met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze .
this medicine contains suc@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glu@@ cose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or suc@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not take .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administ@@ ered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the effect of alcohol is not increased ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the overall inci@@ dence of side effects in children from 2 to 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
clinical trials with adults and adolesc@@ ents in different indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolesc@@ ents , with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged 1 to 11 years who were eligible for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ do@@ sis of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults can be extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolesc@@ ents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolesc@@ ents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied for over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolesc@@ ents did not determine increased inci@@ dence of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets lead to no imp@@ air@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or in adults and adolesc@@ ents in clinical trials .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol was neither an increase in alcohol @-@ induced performance imp@@ air@@ ment nor an increase in dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ es@@ cent patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear , and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
as demonstrated by the overall co@@ res of the questionn@@ aire to the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets decrease effectively the caused by seasonal r@@ hin@@ itis
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic I@@ di@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ up@@ grading of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , which is restricted to met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was about 6 times higher and the C@@ max about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ value of approximately 120 hours .
there are no cl@@ ues for clin@@ ically relevant drug accumulation after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5- 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolesc@@ ents .
12 different individual dose studies showed that the C and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable to those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzy@@ me responsible for metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bra@@ ille bottles with a child @-@ proof poly@@ propylene sealing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at once daily put into the mouth to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms in allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dosage of the ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate must be removed without dam@@ aging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see Section 5.1 ) .
clinical trials in various indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study used up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( ninet@@ een clinical dose ) , clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two individual dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses used in des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied for over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess was observed in the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day compared to plac@@ ebo .
at a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear , and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .

there is limited experience from clinical trials to improve the use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 )
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dosage of the enam@@ el tablets is removed without dam@@ aging it .
the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2,5 mg mel@@ ting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of side effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Sir@@ up@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified by adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablets proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for decre@@ asing the formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .

the spread of this po@@ or@@ ly met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ at@@ ric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 3 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not devi@@ ating from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us Schmel@@ z@@ tabl@@ ette with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate to take , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2,5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients , but in combination with the dose studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dose in children from 6 to 11 years .

at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us proved 5 mg of mel@@ ting tablets as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for decre@@ asing the formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses used in des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a 30 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear , and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of mel@@ ting tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate to take , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
the overall analysis of pre@@ clinical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the enam@@ el tablets revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ations in clinical use .
the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to those with children who are normal met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze .
this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glu@@ cose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall inci@@ dence of side effects in children from 2 to 11 years was similar to the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
small children between 6 and 23 months were the most common adverse events reported on plac@@ ebo , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ( 2,3 % ) .
an additional study was observed in a single dosage of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in solution . no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years .
at the recommended doses , the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( see under section 5.2 ) was comparable to children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolesc@@ ents did not determine increased inci@@ dence of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis may be dependent on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and
as demonstrated by the overall co@@ res of the questionn@@ aire to the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets decrease effectively the burden caused by seasonal r@@ hin@@ itis .
the spread of this limited met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
since A@@ eri@@ us solution contains the same concentration on Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , no bio @-@ equi@@ val@@ ence study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets .
in various individual dose studies , AU@@ C and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable to those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. announces the Committee for Human Use Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company takes its application for the marketing of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov on the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vac@@ cine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ demic .
a flu pan@@ demic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears that can easily spread from humans to humans , because humans have not yet built imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vac@@ cine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; body alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the vac@@ cine and forms antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the immune system is later able to form faster antibodies in a contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface which the human body recogni@@ zes as a body @-@ alien ) was dis@@ connected , cleaned and used as a component of the vac@@ cine .
a survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for assess@@ ing the safety of the vac@@ cine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pan@@ demic vac@@ cines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you would like further information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) that causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , as@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination was not studied .
Generic drugs should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked the anti@@ viral drugs used by the patient before and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral drugs are taken .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ ms is based on body weight .
in combination with other anti @-@ viral medicines , as@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS does not cure , but can delay the immune system damage and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS .
as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 736 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the drug as@@ gener@@ ase with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared with 206 adults who used earlier prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator for effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( virus load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks , more patients had a virus load below 400 copies / ml than under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase also reduced viral load , but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , very few addressed the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the last @-@ week treatment with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase came together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r a higher viral load after four weeks as with the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of as@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , nau@@ sea , r@@ ash , r@@ ash and f@@ ati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
as@@ gener@@ asis may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s Wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are det@@ ri@@ mental to the same as as@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take as@@ gener@@ a are the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ous rose ( die ext@@ in@@ ction of bone tissue ) or an immune response syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Human Use Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
as@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic ampli@@ fiers Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had not taken any prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; October 2000 the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited a permit for the marketing of asylum in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
for usually as@@ gener@@ a capsules should be administ@@ ered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster@@ y of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral disease pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solutions are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for ase @-@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ ur@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the increased addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of ash ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for ase @-@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ ur@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily highest dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors have not been studied in children .
as@@ gener@@ asis is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application is to be performed with cau@@ tion in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contr@@ ain@@ dic@@ ated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
as@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substr@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for the HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with v@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
generally , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic h@@ epatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal heal@@ thin@@ ess .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of h@@ epatitis B or C please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with previously restricted liver function including chronic @-@ active h@@ epatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gen@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , which are metabol@@ ised via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment predomin@@ ates the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ ero@@ i@@ des , including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and supp@@ ression of the ad@@ ren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin strongly depends on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of v@@ ast@@ atin with lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies , including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Ordin@@ ance R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the active substance concentration .
in patients who are taking these drugs at the same time , A@@ gen@@ ase may be less effective due to the reduction of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ ur@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ iat@@ ry symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the potential risk of tox@@ icity due to the high propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this dosage form is contr@@ ain@@ dic@@ ated in children under a age of four and should be used with cau@@ tion in certain other patient groups .
ash should be reduced to 5 when a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy medicines which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ related factors , such as a longer ongoing anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders , associated .
hem@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase of ble@@ eding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis .
at the time of initi@@ ation of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients can develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fact@@ orial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substr@@ ates with low therapeutic width are not allowed at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substr@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substr@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with drugs whose active substances are mainly metabol@@ ised by CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to increased plasma levels with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and a resistance development .
in trying to compens@@ ate the reduced plasma levels by means of a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver have been observed .
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirrors of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be hum@@ ili@@ ated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with Johann@@ is@@ kraut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already uses Johann@@ is@@ kraut , the pren@@ atal surface and , if possible , to check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s Wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
508 % increased , for C@@ max , however , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which demonstrate the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment scheme .
52 % de@@ hum@@ bles when Am@@ ur@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) administ@@ ered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ ecture avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ ecture avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administ@@ ered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended since the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study used to apply as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the ant@@ acid component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the income of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and as@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore , in the case of em@@ ph@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in may reduce the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , cau@@ tion is advisable because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ m@@ asp@@ es .
when these drugs are used together , cau@@ tion is advised ; a thorough pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in by 193 % and thus an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administ@@ er ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in together with as@@ gener@@ ase , it will be recommended to reduce the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with v@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plas@@ min@@ ated levels of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in the plasma at 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value which was observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines which are listed below , including substr@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can lead to inter@@ depen@@ dencies .
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with as@@ ms .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that ant@@ acids do not be taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase , as it can cause res@@ or@@ ption problems .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ation of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma tiles .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , n@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ ami@@ l can be increased 10 by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , thus increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of these drugs .
simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ion with ase can considerably increase their plasma concentration and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side @-@ effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical trial , in which rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ ason@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) more than 7 days at subjects increased , while the endo@@ genous c@@ ort@@ is@@ ol declined by about 86 % ( 90 % rate interval 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ a with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment predomin@@ ates the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases of plasma levels can be expected during con@@ current administration .
since plasma @-@ level increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to My@@ opathy including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
a more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations up to the stabil@@ isation of the mirrors is recommended , as the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased simultaneously ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied together with the Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while with the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ a with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am cau@@ tion .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible rise in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 @-@ 4 @-@ fold .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is administ@@ ered together with Am@@ ur@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ iat@@ ry symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to adjust the current dose when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in simultaneous dispens@@ ing of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of INR ( International Ordin@@ ation R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of a weak@@ ening or intensi@@ fication of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional dosage of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predic@@ table , so alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( e.g. D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at con@@ current dosage of as@@ gener@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk l@@ ending rats were demonstrated am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances , however , it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was administ@@ ered from the in@@ gest@@ ion to the uter@@ us through to the end of the breast feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 12 body weight during the down@@ time .
the further development of the offspring , including Fer@@ til@@ isation and re@@ productive capacity , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother @-@ animal .
atri@@ um harm@@ lessness was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the ase @-@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , and occurred early and often led to a breakthrough therapy .
many of these events are not clar@@ ified whether they are related to the intake of as@@ gener@@ a or another at the same time to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease .
most of the af@@ ore@@ mentioned side effects stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 30@@ 01 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg of as@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to study medi@@ ation and performed in more than 1 % of patients , as well as laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are performed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripher@@ al and uter@@ ine fat tissue , more in@@ tra @-@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ vi@@ cal fat accumulation ( Sti@@ ern@@ ack ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated individuals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / Zi@@ dov@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ ack ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , there were 7 cases ( 3 % ) in case of 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.001 ) .
r@@ ashes were usually slightly em@@ bos@@ sed , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or imp@@ ec@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks without the treatment had to be ab@@ orted with im@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
at the time of initi@@ ation of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients can develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of ase twice daily along with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; an exception formed increases of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which were received in patients who received as@@ gener@@ ase along with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive action .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thus prevents the processing of viral gene and g@@ ag pol@@ ye@@ wear levels with the consequence of an education un@@ ripe , non @-@ inf@@ ectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blast cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M for chron@@ ically infected cells .
the link between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients with currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dr@@ illed treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
at six@@ teen of 434 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 732 , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates could be examined gen@@ otyp@@ ically .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of 13 of 14 children in which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not appear before treated patients showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 46@@ I / L , I@@ 47@@ V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , A@@ 7@@ 1V , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M .
in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and their extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) to patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ing mut@@ ations occurred :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance testing , gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorith@@ m for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / L / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for analy@@ zing the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance testing , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ical interpret@@ ations can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to evaluate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic Cut @-@ off@@ s ( crossover points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpre@@ t results of a resistance test .
each of these four genetic patterns associated with reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic samples creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients , with whom a Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ im@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . the preservation of this activity seems dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early departure of a failure therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which PI pre @-@ treated adults ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I have been included in part A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison with the time @-@ adjusted mean change from bas@@ eline ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ loss threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased as@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children between the ages of 2 and 18 , of which 152 with PI were treated .
in the studies , A@@ generative solution for intake and capsules was examined three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , about 25 % of patients included in the study showed a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the bas@@ eline value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data should be considered in the therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ tem &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , for C@@ max on the other hand reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed onto a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of the blood circulation into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ connected am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active ingredient fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval in dependence on the overall doctor &apos;s power concentration in the ste@@ ady state via the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , pharmaceu@@ ticals , which indu@@ ce or in@@ hibit or in@@ hibit or pose a substr@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , must be administ@@ ered with cau@@ tion at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of ase @-@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily pren@@ atal exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram@@ ming base .
also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction is likely to be low on the elim@@ ination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these regim@@ ens lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those who are achieved on healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ p @-@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for can@@ o@@ gens with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ epat@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular at@@ oms occurred in male animals with doses of the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , correspon@@ ded .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ epat@@ oc@@ ell@@ ar aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
out of the present exposure data in humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications , however , there were little indications of the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test to rats and chro@@ mos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test on human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical everyday life by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously , no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of the disease nor after the end of the treatment .
studies on tox@@ icity in young animals treated at the age of 4 showed a high mort@@ ality in both the animals and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in a system@@ ic plasma @-@ exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes , including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes , were observed , pointing to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the increased addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of ash ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for ase @-@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ ur@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily highest dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application is to be performed with cau@@ tion in patients with weak or slight liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contr@@ ain@@ dic@@ ated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Ordin@@ ance R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the substance concentration .
as@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 27 when a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ related factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related met@@ abolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and a resistance development .
508 % increased , for C@@ max , however , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ ecture avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administ@@ ered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended since the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
when these drugs are used together , cau@@ tion is advised ; a thorough pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administ@@ er ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , n@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ ami@@ l can be increased due to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , thus increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of these drugs .
in a clinical trial , in which rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ ason@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) more than 7 days at subjects increased , while the endo@@ genous c@@ ort@@ is@@ ol declined by about 86 % ( 90 % rate interval 82 to 89 % ) .
in simultaneous dispens@@ ing of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of INR ( International Ordin@@ ation R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of a weak@@ ening or intensi@@ fication of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of no@@ re@@ thin@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by 22 % bz@@ w .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fo@@ etus .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was administ@@ ered from the in@@ gest@@ ion to the uter@@ us through to the end of the breast feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during the down@@ time .
atri@@ um harm@@ lessness was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive action .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blast cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ p Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M for chronic in@@ ated cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µg / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . the preservation of this activity seems dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , therapy optimization should be taken into account with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; in@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; agro@@ ase .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ connected am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active continu@@ ance varies during the dosing interval in dependence on the overall doctor &apos;s power concentration in the ste@@ ady state via the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , pharmaceu@@ ticals , which indu@@ ce or in@@ hibit or in@@ hibit or pose a substr@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , must be administ@@ ered with cau@@ tion at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction is likely to be low on the elim@@ ination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for can@@ o@@ gens with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ epat@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular at@@ oms occurred in male animals with dos@@ ages which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ epat@@ oc@@ at@@ inal aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
out of the present exposure data in humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications , however , there is little evidence of the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test to rats and chro@@ mos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test on human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on tox@@ icity in young animals treated at the age of 4 showed a high mort@@ ality in both the animals and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in juven@@ iles the met@@ abolic path@@ ways are not fully mature , so that Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
Generic drugs are used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefits of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake was demonstrated neither in patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients or with PI pre @-@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solutions are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for ase is 17 mg ( 1,1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily highest dose of 2800 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
additionally , since there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take and low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of as@@ gener@@ ase solution is contr@@ ain@@ dic@@ ated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col@@ lagen , as@@ gener@@ ase solution is contr@@ ain@@ dic@@ ated in children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with v@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Ordin@@ ance R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the active substance concentration .
ash should be reduced in duration when a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors , such as a lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic distur@@ ban@@ ces .
hem@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase of ble@@ eding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and a resistance development .
508 % increased , for C@@ max , however , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ion with ase can considerably increase their plasma concentration and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side @-@ effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on the data on 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , significantly higher plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is expected to be significantly higher than Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . as@@ gener@@ a solution to intake may not be used due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained propylene gly@@ col during pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the milk l@@ ending rats were demonstrated am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances , however , it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was administ@@ ered from the in@@ gest@@ ion to the uter@@ us through to the end of the breast feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 55 body weight during the down@@ time .
atri@@ um harm@@ lessness was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
many of these events are not clar@@ ified whether they are related to the intake of as@@ gener@@ a or another at the same time to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients with currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dr@@ illed treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
early sl@@ ur@@ ry of a failure 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
62 Based on this data should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; in@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; agro@@ ase .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed onto a large cou@@ gh volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of the blood circulation into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ epat@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
in a system@@ ic plasma @-@ exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes , including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes , were observed , pointing to a delayed development .

the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dara depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of case war@@ ts in the genital area , Al@@ dara is up to a maximum of 16 weeks apply three times weekly . • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , the cream is six weeks a week to apply weekly .
the cream is to be applied thin@@ ly to the affected skin surfaces before bed@@ time , so that they remain on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before they are washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dara was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same cream , but without the active substance ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete cooling of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dara was also studied in 724 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dara or the plac@@ ebo could be performed either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara was also tested in two studies of 505 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses .
• In all studies , Al@@ dara was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • In case of treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete reduction rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • The results of the two studies led to bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas resulted in a complete reduction rate of 66 % to 80 % compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dara ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

Monday , Wednesday and Friday ( Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) to apply before the bed and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long to continue until all visible war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ odic area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
when a dose was om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream can be applied in a thin layer and rub in the pur@@ ified , with ti@@ lt infected skin area until the cream is completely re@@ trac@@ ted .
in these patients it should take place between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
in these patients it should take place between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host@@ - reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe ph@@ im@@ osis and one case were observed with a tendency leading to circumc@@ ision .
with an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations were also observed , which made a treatment necessary and / or caused by temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine which required an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous res@@ ins in the genital and peripher@@ al region , no clinical experience has previously existed .
limited data suggest an increased rate of incl@@ ine reduc@@ tions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a lower efficacy in this patient group regarding the elim@@ ination of co@@ war@@ ts .
the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm of the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not studied .
local skin reactions are common but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if it is necessary due to the dis@@ comfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after re@@ generating the treated skin for about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there are currently no data on long term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be taken into consideration in super@@ fi@@ de cell car@@ cin@@ omas .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s there are no clinical experiences , so the application is not recommended in previously untreated patients .
data from an open clinical study indicates that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a reduced lik@@ el@@ ihood of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip boat .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ish ker@@ at@@ osis on fore@@ arms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , so such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity during therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause great dis@@ comfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 Ak@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower complete treatment rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immun@@ o @-@ stim@@ ulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with cau@@ tion in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies do not have direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / f@@ ö@@ tal development , the release or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although neither after one @-@ time nor after multiple top@@ ical application quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um mirrors ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) were achieved , no recommendation can be given during l@@ act@@ ation .
the most common shared and considered prob@@ able or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in the trials with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the treatment of the infection war@@ ts ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most common reported and probably or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream associated with side effects include dis@@ comfort at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ al patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of Phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects indicated by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
according to the test plan , the clinical evidence assessed in this plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials often resulted in local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ tion / sc@@ ams ( 23 % ) and oil ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
according to the test plan , the assessment of the clinical evidence shows that in these studies , five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is very common to severe er@@ y@@ thema ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe scar@@ ring and ru@@ sting ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials to investigate the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of the ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ p@@ eci@@ a was observed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the acci@@ dental unique oral absorption of 200 mg i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the most clin@@ ically serious side @-@ effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , existed in hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or intrav@@ en@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , increasing system@@ ic concentrations of the alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines have been proven following the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies showed that efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the co@@ war@@ ts in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is clearly superior over 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment .
at 60 % of the patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od who were treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , patients were treated completely ; this was 20 % of the patients with plac@@ ebo treated patients in the case ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ time use per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ fic@@ ent bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this also remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or in the face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical cooling after one or two treatment periods .
the supposed indications of external co@@ war@@ ts , ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ itis and super@@ fi@@ dal bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dara cream was examined in four random@@ ised double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with m@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um cont@@ ag@@ ios@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 576 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the doses examined there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) respectively .
a minimal system@@ ic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ ru@@ gen 0.1 , 0.2 and 1,6 ng / ml when using in the face ( 12,5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10@@ times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ value after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after top@@ ical application to MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fic@@ ent bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal tox@@ icity in the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ itia weight ; a study conducted for the der@@ mal application for four months showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice by mal@@ administration in three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ours at the application point .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low system@@ ic absorption of the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , there is a risk for humans to look very low due to system@@ ic exposure .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms is used for enzy@@ me therapy in patients with verified diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dose I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerve related ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not removed and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
following non neurolog@@ ical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , movements comp@@ licate , lower pul@@ mon@@ ary volume , heart and eye diseases .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edit@@ ary met@@ abolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alized devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study focused primarily on the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness has also been measured ( by investig@@ ating its effect regarding the reduction of the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me reduced the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin r@@ ash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions to the inf@@ usion point .
very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms may not be used in patients who may react strongly hyper@@ sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to lar@@ yn@@ d@@ ase or other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medi@@ cines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information potentially known each year , which may possibly be known and necessary to update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will be patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in response to the reactions to inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the marketing of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese hamster ov@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the chin@@ ese hamster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzy@@ me therapy in patients with verified diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dose I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inher@@ ited met@@ abolic disorders .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been identified , and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side @-@ effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion @-@ day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , specifically these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the inf@@ usion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should only be performed in an appropriate clinical environment in which re@@ vit@@ alization facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies to Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction have to be treated with cau@@ tion when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
since little experience is due to resum@@ ing treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before starting the inf@@ usion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tic ) to minimize the potential inci@@ dence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
in case of light or moderate inf@@ usion induced reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , inf@@ usion has to be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to consider .
the inf@@ usion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or pro@@ c@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of lar@@ d@@ oni@@ d@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy that include embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase over breast milk is recommended , it is recommended to not breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms .
adverse reactions in clinical trials were prescribed mainly as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are shown in the following table following the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asm , respir@@ ation and facial oil ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in the context of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years , with mainly severe trial form and a treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intrav@@ en@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intrav@@ en@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intrav@@ en@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intrav@@ en@@ ous every 2 weeks .
in most patients it occurred within 3 months after the start of the treatment for a ser@@ o@@ idal version , whereby the patients aged less than 5 years with a more severe form of trial were reported ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature ej@@ ection from the study ) , there were no antibodies found in 13 / 45 patients , not by radio@@ immun@@ o @-@ cip@@ itation ( RI@@ P ) ass@@ ay , among them 3 patients with whom it never came to ser@@ o@@ gue version .
patients with low to low anti@@ body levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , while in patients with high anti@@ body tit@@ ers , a variable reduction of G@@ AG was determined in the har@@ n .
four patients ( three in Phase 3 study and one in Phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ gin@@ ally to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ oni@@ fication activity in vit@@ ro , which did not affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the inci@@ dence of adverse drug reactions , although the appearance of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the ration@@ ale for the enzy@@ me therapy is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate restoration of the enzy@@ me activity .
after intrav@@ en@@ ous inf@@ usion , Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is rapidly removed from circulation and is absorbed by cells into the lymp@@ ho@@ om@@ es , most likely over Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate rec@@ ept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were studied in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the serious phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms for a further 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and ability to be shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as emerg@@ es from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study was normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease in the G@@ AG mirror was found in the urine ( µg / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
with regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end point , clin@@ ically significant changes spann@@ ing five activity variable ( expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute test , movement area of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open Phase 2 study was conducted , in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with the middle course of the trial ) .
in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to elevated G@@ ag@@ - mirror in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) found after the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe trial form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle course form showed a normal mental develop@@ mental velocity , whereas in the older patients with severe trial form , only limited or no progress in cognitive development were determined .
in a Phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me met@@ ering schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test .
100 E / kg intrav@@ en@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intrav@@ en@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intrav@@ en@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intrav@@ en@@ ous every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intrav@@ en@@ ous every 2 weeks may represent a just@@ i@@ fiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schem@@ ata is equivalent .
the European Medi@@ cines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to those affected by older and less strongly affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have no chemotherapy ( medicines for cancer ) , and mal@@ ign@@ ant ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) or may be easily spread to other parts of the body . • more advanced or metast@@ atic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell epithel@@ ial cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have previously not been treated , combined with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens compared to some therapy .
to reduce side effects , patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
when A@@ lim@@ ta is administ@@ ered together with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , should additionally be given an anti @-@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um ( medicines for v@@ om@@ iting ) and flu@@ ids ( to prevent a lack of fluid ) .
in patients whose blood image changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be post@@ pon@@ ed , removed or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to divide .
the transformation of P@@ emet@@ y@@ xed into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active time in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared with a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metast@@ atic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , compared to the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( other medicines for cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell epithel@@ ial cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta was longer survival than with the compar@@ ative medication .
in September 2004 , the European Commission approved the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. to grant asylum in the whole European Union .
each flow bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - sis is taken from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is indicated in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cell car@@ cin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ op@@ al advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cell car@@ cin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) administ@@ ered intrav@@ en@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in amounts to 75 mg / m ² of KO@@ F as inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - Inf@@ usion on the first day of any 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administ@@ ered as intrav@@ en@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
reduction of the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given on the day before and on the day of the p@@ emet@@ ry gift as well as on the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ emet@@ ry , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment regim@@ en as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need to receive an intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mcg . ) in week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed dosage , as well as after every third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving p@@ emet@@ ry , a full blood image should be created before each offering , including a differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ y@@ tes and a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ an@@ in @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times of the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose @-@ examination must take place under the re@@ affir@@ mation of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood @-@ picture or the maximum hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the preceding therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 ble@@ eding .
should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient receives the value before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be ab@@ orted if in patients after 2 doses reduction or hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort in degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical trials have no indication that at the age of 65 years or above , there is an increased side @-@ efficiency risk in patients aged 65 years or above .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary to go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data position in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bi@@ li@@ ru@@ by bor@@ der@@ value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ases of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ ples of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically examined in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ gin@@ u@@ pp@@ ression and may not be administ@@ ered to patients before their absolute ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ ils count again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis count again a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ ils , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te numbers and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity such as ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ enia became be@@ o- b@@ illed if a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 occurred .
therefore all patients who are treated with P@@ emet@@ ry must be dependent on fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic action to reduce treatment @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid con@@ current intake of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ logi@@ st@@ ika ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - tens 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ y@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for whom a therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ value for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ y@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients with whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid accumulation in trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the cross before the P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed treatment should be considered .
5 serious cardiovascular inci@@ dents , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed occasionally when this drug was usually administ@@ ered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated vital substances ( except yellow fever , this vac@@ c@@ ination is contr@@ ain@@ dic@@ ated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage is due to the re@@ productive capacity by P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised of the treatment program , consult with regard to the sperm cell activation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ logi@@ st@@ ika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) lead to a reduced phase of re@@ frac@@ tory effects .
cau@@ tion is therefore advised if in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid are used in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - tens 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ y@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data regarding the interaction potential associated with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ value such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of t@@ anning status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of INR ( International Ordin@@ ation R@@ atio ) if the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ emet@@ ry in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ timet@@ abol@@ ites , severe labour defects are expected in pregnancy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ emet@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should not be used during pregnancy except if necessary and after careful consideration of the use for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to the re@@ productive capacity by P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the treatment begins to obtain advice on the sper@@ mat@@ o@@ zo@@ a .
it is not known whether p@@ emet@@ ry is transferred to breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed inf@@ ant cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the inci@@ dence and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma and the random@@ ised c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , as well as 163 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma who were random@@ ized c@@ is@@ plat@@ in as mon@@ otherapy .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC Tox@@ ic@@ ities , which were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients receiving random@@ ised p@@ emet@@ ry , included su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as .
the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory tox@@ icity grade 3 and 4 was similar to the conden@@ sed results of three single P@@ emet@@ re@@ ous Mon@@ o@@ therapies ( n = 164 ) phase 2 , except ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ enia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared with 5.3 % ) and an increase in the Al@@ an@@ in@@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to lead to differences in the patient population since the p@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and significantly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or ab@@ normal initial values of liver function tests .

primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients receiving the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statist@@ ically significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) related to mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the all@@ some C@@ is@@ pl@@ a- tin @-@ arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms of arms showed an improvement in lung function parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / c@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a mul@@ tic@@ enter , random@@ ised , open Phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic N@@ SC@@ LC based chemotherapy had a medi@@ an survival of 8.3 months with AL@@ IM@@ TA treated patients ( intent to treat Pop@@ ulation n = 283 ) and of 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival depends on AL@@ IM@@ TA in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ological type ( n = 399 , 9.2 versus 8.0 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0,@@ 018 ) .
limited data of a separately random@@ ised , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ emet@@ ry between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analysis of the P@@ Q population is consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination .
middle P@@ FS was 4.8 months for combining Gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ plat@@ in versus 5.9 % ( 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.15 ) , the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 33.@@ 9 ) for the combination of AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ plat@@ in versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 31.@@ 4 ) for combining gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
the analysis of the influence of N@@ SC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in accordance with the hist@@ ology , see the table below .
CI = Consult@@ ation interval ; IT@@ T = In@@ tent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statist@@ ically significant for non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority , with a total frequency interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ lower limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 645 ( p &lt; 0.001 ) .
patients treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in require less trans@@ f@@ usions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ f@@ usions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te trans@@ f@@ usions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.0@@ 02 ) .
in addition , patients required the administration of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine / Dar@@ b@@ opo@@ et@@ ine ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) , G @-@ C@@ SF / GM @-@ C@@ SF ( 3.1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.0@@ 04 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ y@@ xed by offering as mono@@ therapeu@@ tics have been studied in 426 cancer patients with different solid tum@@ ours in doses of 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in inf@@ usion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
p@@ emet@@ ry is mainly left out in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the given dose will be found in the urine within 24 hours after application .

the resulting solution is clear and the col@@ oring extends from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow , without com@@ promising the quality of the sample .
it is used for over@@ weight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who are taking the all@@ i and cannot toler@@ ate weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes become in@@ hibited , they cannot abol@@ ish some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of fats which are associated with food un@@ digest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with 391 over@@ weight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg , after one year recorded an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of plac@@ ebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no patient @-@ relevant weight loss could not be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots at after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with fa@@ eces , Stu@@ h@@ ld@@ preced@@ ence , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , flu@@ ency ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it may not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or medicines like war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be applied in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digest@@ ive tract ) or to cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; July 2007 the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited a permit for the marketing of or@@ list@@ at G@@ SK in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all@@ i is inde@@ xed to weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fet@@ ish @-@ reduced diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolesc@@ ents under 18 , since insufficient data are available for efficacy and safety .
however , as Or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally absorbed , there is no adjustment of the dosage required for elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or ren@@ al function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption Syn@@ drome • L@@ act@@ ation ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurrence of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich individual meal or low @-@ fat diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes is accompanied by improved met@@ abolic monitoring , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tic must be adjusted if necessary .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines must be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnant measures to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in the event of severe di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma tiles was observed .
when using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( internationally standardized ratio , INR ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at up to 4 full years in clinical trials , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene remained in the normal range .
however , the patient should be advised to take an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin preparation before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a single @-@ mal@@ dosage A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a limited number of healthy volunteers received at the same time received a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect negative effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological impact of the drug , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side @-@ effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
the inci@@ dence of known side @-@ effects found after the market introduction of or@@ list@@ at is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety with regard to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms .
individual doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administ@@ ered to normal and over@@ weight subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch reported by Or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosage , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid rep@@ ay@@ ment of possible system@@ ic effects , which are attri@@ but@@ able to the li@@ mp@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at , can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect sets in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bond to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic lip@@ ases .
from clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ic , fet@@ ish @-@ reduced diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight during the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months .
the average change in the overall chol@@ est@@ erin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at wa@@ ist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg of or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma could be detected only spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients who administ@@ ered the minimal system@@ ic res@@ or@@ b@@ ated dose , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ cine @-@ group ) , could be identified , the approxim@@ ate 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , can@@ o@@ ogen@@ ic potential and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , pre@@ clinical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will severely affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
the most common side effects are associated with the effect of the capsules and are caused by the fact that more fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted out of the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , because at this time you may not have reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional def@@ ici@@ encies : • Beg@@ inside you already have a few days , or better a week , before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat ev@@ enly to daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you may take for each meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main meal or a cl@@ assy night table , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with those accompanying symptoms learn to control these with time by adjusting their diet .
• Do not store the medicine for children . • You must not apply all@@ i after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date indicated on the envel@@ ope . • Do not hold over 25 ° C in order to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ ag@@ el that will serve to keep the capsules dry .

Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the excessive trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( a medicine that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended since the effects in this age group are not enough information .
this means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , to the rec@@ ept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies to 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy regim@@ ens which are strong or moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no v@@ om@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the regular trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no v@@ om@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceu@@ ticals Ltd. approved by Alo@@ xi in the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer disease and for the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , which is induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids given before chemotherapy .
as pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ nest@@ y fruit @-@ ip@@ ation or signs of sub@@ acute idi@@ om after injection are closely monitored .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , cau@@ tion is advised for simultaneous dispens@@ ing of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with whom the Q@@ t interval is extended or that tend to such an extension .
in addition to a further chem@@ o@@ therapeutic application , Alo@@ xi is not to be used in the days following chemotherapy , nor for the treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not in@@ hibit tumor activity ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intrav@@ en@@ ous dose pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , the simultaneous administration of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , hem@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician .
clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 mc@@ gram to observed side @-@ effects ( total 633 patients ) , which were at least likely associated with alo@@ xi , head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and fruit ip@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest dose , there were similar frequency of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ action relationships to be observed .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy with an alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 micro@@ grams or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ weight 7.3 hours ) received that was given on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intrav@@ en@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 667 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine , as well as 250 or 750 mc@@ gram pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , were compared to patients who received 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intrav@@ en@@ ously on day 1 .
results of studies with moderate @-@ dose chemotherapy and the study with highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable to the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ ari@@ zation and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of administ@@ ered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intrav@@ en@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentration a slow elim@@ ination of the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
according to intrav@@ en@@ ous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean medium ( ± SD ) measured in 11 test@@ ic@@ ular car@@ cin@@ oma patients ran@@ ged from day 1 and day 5 to 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations , an intrav@@ en@@ ous administration of 0,25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the value of 0.75 mg measured after a one @-@ time intrav@@ en@@ ous administration ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the dispos@@ ition of 0.75 mg higher .
about 40 % are eliminated over the kid@@ neys , and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
in vit@@ ro studies on the metabolism have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser degree , the I@@ so@@ enz@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination After an intrav@@ en@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
following a unique intrav@@ en@@ ous stu@@ b injection , the total body of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the termin@@ ale elim@@ ination of the elim@@ ination of the liver and the average system@@ ic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is therefore not justified .
in pre@@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient beyond the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 Pre@@ clinical trials suggest that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ ari@@ zation and can pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose said in approximately the 30 @-@ fold of therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ ms ( thy@@ ro@@ id gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , ad@@ ren@@ al mark ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is intended for one @-@ time application in humans , the relevance of these results is very low .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report , in which the failure of approval for the marketing of the drug for the treatment of h@@ epatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should re@@ semble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) h@@ epatitis C ( a liver disease caused by virus infection ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic examination , the liver tissue damage , besides , the values of the liver enzymes al@@ an@@ in- and amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are elevated in the blood ab@@ normal .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which stim@@ ulates it for the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon laid data against the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( compound structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in h@@ epatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with h@@ epatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference doctor in 455 patients .
the study was measured how many patients responded to the treatment after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment ( i.e. no sign of virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA .
in addition , concerns were expressed in detail that the data for the stability of the drug and the drug to be mark@@ eted does not suff@@ ice .
the number of patients with h@@ epatitis C respon@@ ding to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease progres@@ sed again in more patients than with the reference doctor ; Al@@ ph@@ eon also had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study was not sufficiently vali@@ dated for the study of the question of how far the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) .
it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ ations ( cr@@ acking or cutting ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presum@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go might not affect this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied to patients from the age of nine months , but patients under 18 years of age may not be more than 2 % of the body surface to be treated .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the physician should re@@ examine the patient and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om@@ es ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was sub@@ du@@ ed after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 52.@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients with plac@@ ebo responded to treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in Hau@@ tw@@ unden , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( whi@@ pped hollow spaces in the body tissue ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the job .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go were predomin@@ ant in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , • infected small la@@ z@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission approved the company Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the import@@ ation of al@@ tar@@ go in the whole European Union .
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of sensiti@@ zation or severe local irrit@@ ation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment is canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment me@@ ticul@@ ously wi@@ pes out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as path@@ ogen ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials at secondary infected wounds the effectiveness of retin@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was in@@ adequate .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected area occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentration used in humans for top@@ ical use on sh@@ ot@@ ed skin or infected superf@@ icial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on sh@@ ot@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical use in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ at@@ ulin is applied during system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive tox@@ icity after oral consumption and are in@@ adequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial treatment is clearly indicated and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding continues / termin@@ ated or the therapy should be continued with Al@@ tar@@ go , it is possible to wei@@ gh between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefits of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go applied , the most common reported side effect was Ir@@ rit@@ ation at the point of adoption , which was about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic D@@ eri@@ vat of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ sto@@ anus ( earlier ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ sto@@ anus ) .
the effect mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding place of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om , which differs from the binding places of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding agent and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ Transfer Center .
by linking to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line in@@ hibit the pep@@ tide transfer , sometimes block P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub @-@ units .
should , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms should be question@@ able should be targeted by experts .
no differences were found in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin opposite S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ cl@@ usion to intact and on sh@@ iel@@ ded skin for up to 7 days .
from 516 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary , trau@@ matic wounds , individual plas@@ min ro@@ bes were obtained .
the sampling procedure was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before medi@@ ation and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic intake of the people after top@@ ical use of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 s@@ nu@@ g skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vit@@ ro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , lower involvement of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C8 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were performed over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .
in vit@@ ro verification on gene mut@@ ation and / or chro@@ mos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in the rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo investigation of chro@@ mos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which was achieved by up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 s@@ nu@@ g skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study of rats were observed in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ icity ( reduced body weight of the fo@@ etus and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal tox@@ icity .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied as part of a vac@@ c@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against h@@ epatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix must only be used if there is a low risk of h@@ epatitis B infection during immun@@ ization and ensures that the vac@@ c@@ ination plan existing from two doses can be brought to an end .
if a dose of h@@ epatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another h@@ epatitis C or B vac@@ cine can be given .
vac@@ cines work by att@@ aching the immune system ( the natural defence of the body ) , &quot; as it can fight against a disease .
after a child has received the vac@@ cine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vac@@ cine Twin@@ rix adults approved since 1996 and the vac@@ cine Twin@@ rix for children since 1997 .
the three vac@@ cines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administ@@ ered as part of a vac@@ c@@ ination plan existing from three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults have also been used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vac@@ cin@@ ated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective anti@@ body concentrations .
in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vac@@ cine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix performed between 98 and 100 % of vac@@ cin@@ ated children one month after the last injection to develop protective anti@@ body concentrations against h@@ epatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month interval between inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vac@@ cine doses ) are head@@ ache , appet@@ ite deficiency , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , consistency ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix must not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other constitu@@ ents or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the placing of the Ambi@@ rix in the complete
the standar@@ dis@@ ation plan for the prim@@ iti@@ zation with the Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses of vac@@ c@@ ination , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose ranges between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a vac@@ c@@ ination is desired for h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B , vac@@ cines can be vac@@ cin@@ ated with appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vac@@ cines or combination vac@@ cine .
the anti @-@ h@@ epatitis B surface anti@@ gen ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ h@@ epatitis A virus ( anti @-@ h@@ epatitis C ) anti@@ body values observed in the same size as after vac@@ c@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vac@@ cines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have addressed a Hepatitis A@@ - vac@@ c@@ ination as protection require a refresh@@ er vac@@ c@@ ination as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all inj@@ ections vac@@ cines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vac@@ cine .
if rapid protection against h@@ epatitis B is required , the Stand@@ ardi@@ mp@@ f@@ esch@@ eme is recommended with the combination simp@@ lex , which contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ ated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface anti@@ gen .
in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with immune system disorders , there is no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs @-@ anti@@ body value after the first di@@ mming , so that in these cases the gift of further vac@@ c@@ ination doses may be necessary .
since an intra@@ oral injection or intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ etus , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases after intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular administration to ble@@ eding .
when Ambi@@ rix is administ@@ ered in the second year of life with a combined di@@ ph@@ eric , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ us@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vac@@ cine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or combined with a combined mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ umps @-@ ro@@ val vac@@ cine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ defects it has to be assumed that there is possibly no sufficient immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the inci@@ dence of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , mat@@ ing , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ ache and fever was comparable to the inci@@ dence observed in earlier thi@@ omer@@ ically and preser@@ v@@ ative vac@@ cine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vac@@ c@@ ination doses of the Ambi@@ rix were administ@@ ered to a total of 10@@ 27 vac@@ cin@@ ations between 1 and 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination simp@@ listic comparison .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and activity based on a calculation basis per vac@@ cine Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0,7 % of the subjects , compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the gift of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination simp@@ lex .
after the complete vac@@ c@@ ination cycle , 66,@@ 4 % of the subjects that Ambi@@ rix had received , about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % among the subjects who had been vac@@ cin@@ ated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vac@@ cine .
however , the frequency of dex@@ ter@@ ity was comparable high per pro @-@ tape ( i.e. over the entire vac@@ c@@ ination cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received the Ambi@@ rix , compared to 36.@@ 2 % among the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vac@@ cine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and dex@@ ter@@ ity was small and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination of combination with the 3 @-@ doses @-@ vac@@ c@@ ination scheme .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year vac@@ c@@ ination , the appearance of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination simp@@ lex with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ ated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ated h@@ epatitis B surface anti@@ gen .
at the 6- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vac@@ c@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a more common occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vac@@ c@@ ination that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vac@@ cine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vac@@ cine with the combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ ated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ated h@@ epatitis B &apos;s surface anti@@ gen was statist@@ ically not different .
in clinical trials conducted in vac@@ c@@ ination at the age of 1 to 15 years , ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose , for month 6 administ@@ rated dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ Bs were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose , for month 6 administ@@ rated dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study conducted in 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard Combin@@ ation Sim@@ ple with three doses .
in the 289 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was evaluated , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against h@@ epatitis B were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3 @-@ dose im@@ ple@@ tion compared to Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which was reached in a clinical compar@@ ative study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the full vac@@ c@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vac@@ cin@@ ations received either a 2 doses @-@ vac@@ c@@ ination scheme with the Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses @-@ vac@@ c@@ ination scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA @-@ units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ ated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10@@ µg of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface anti@@ gen .
for persons who were aged between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs was detected over at least 24 months after immun@@ ization with the Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vac@@ c@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to those found after vac@@ c@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination simp@@ lex , consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ ated h@@ epat@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ated h@@ epatitis B surface anti@@ gen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study in 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , demonstrated that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibodies can be compared 24 months after immun@@ ization in the 0 @-@ 6 month vac@@ cine is compared to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vac@@ c@@ ination .
when the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life coinci@@ des with the refresh@@ ment of a combined di@@ ph@@ eric , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ us@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vac@@ cine efficacy ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) , or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ umps @-@ ro@@ cket vac@@ cine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical trial conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates similar to earlier form@@ ulations .
the vac@@ cine is examined both before and after res@@ ins on any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
according to article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art Char@@ ging Hub is carried out by a state laboratory or an authorized laboratory for this purpose .

the h@@ epatitis A virus is commonly transmitted through viral food@@ stu@@ ffs and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as by bathing in water poll@@ uted waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a p@@ ale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( laughter ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vac@@ cines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with h@@ epatitis C or h@@ epatitis B virus , even if the complete vac@@ cine series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with h@@ epatitis C or h@@ epatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vac@@ c@@ ination doses ( although you / your child does not feel un@@ comfortable or sick at the vac@@ cine point ) , vac@@ c@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections , which damage the liver or cause symptoms , which are similar to those after h@@ epatitis C or h@@ epatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child already has shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vac@@ cine including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , respiratory or sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . • If your child has already had an allergic reaction to an earlier vac@@ c@@ ination against h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever / has .
• If you want to have a protection against h@@ epatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usual dose of the second vac@@ cine ) .
at a potential risk of infection with h@@ epatitis B between the first and second vac@@ c@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vac@@ c@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead he will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined h@@ epatitis C / h@@ epatitis B vac@@ cine with a reduced content of effective constitu@@ ents per vac@@ cine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface anti@@ gen ) .
the second vac@@ cine of this vac@@ cine with reduced content of active ingredients is usually administ@@ ered a month after the first dose and should give you a vac@@ cine protection against termination of the vac@@ cine series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is suffering from people suffering from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s body , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vac@@ c@@ ination cannot be sufficient so a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vac@@ c@@ ination is .
21 Send your doctor if you / your child take other medicines ( including those who have been vac@@ cin@@ ated ) or if you / your child have been vac@@ cin@@ ated recently or have received immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or has been planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vac@@ cine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both h@@ epatitis A and B viruses .
if a different vac@@ cine must be given simultaneously with the Ambi@@ rix , it should be vac@@ cin@@ ated at separate places and as different limb@@ s as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administ@@ ered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vac@@ cine will nevertheless be sufficient .
typically , Ambi@@ rix is not administ@@ ered pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urg@@ ently required that they are vac@@ cin@@ ated against h@@ epatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vac@@ c@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 prescribed doses ) : • P@@ ain or dis@@ comfort at the inser@@ tion point or red@@ ness • Mat@@ ernity • irrit@@ ability • head@@ ache • App@@ et@@ it@@ man@@ gel
♦ Pre@@ fer@@ ential ( up to 1 case per 10 p@@ enn@@ ant doses ) : • sw@@ elling at the injection point • Fe@@ ver ( above 38 ° C ) • Di@@ d • gast@@ ro@@ intestinal complaints
further side effects , the days or weeks after vac@@ c@@ ination with comparable combination or individual vac@@ cines against h@@ epatitis A and Hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 reported doses ) are :
these include locally restricted or extensive r@@ ashes that can be it@@ ching or ves@@ ical , sw@@ elling of the eyes and face , sh@@ aking breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packages of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data that has been known since the issu@@ ance of the first permit for the placing of the market , CH@@ MP expressed the opinion that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for the Ambi@@ rix stays positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix has been in circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete end@@ oid defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia is - split into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administ@@ ered via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose in the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study because ammon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a plac@@ ebo , i.e. without active substance ) .
ammon@@ ia can also cause loss of appet@@ ite , a ab@@ normal ac@@ idity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , impot@@ ence , fluid retention , p@@ ains , v@@ om@@ iting , nau@@ sea , const@@ ip@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , unpleasant odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Human Use Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) conclu@@ des that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the u@@ rea cycle is effectively prevented from excessive ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ ia was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because due to the rare condition of the disease , only limited information about this medicine was available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzy@@ me deficiency has already manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest@@ ed form ( in@@ complete enzy@@ me defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , there is an indication of the use when in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis a hyper@@ ammon@@ ite enc@@ ephal@@ opathy .
for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with lo@@ op@@ holes , AM@@ NA@@ X is also available in gran@@ ulate form .
daily dose is calculated according to the protein int@@ oler@@ ance and the daily protein intake required for the growth and development of the patient &apos;s daily protein intake .
the previous clinical experience is the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as adolesc@@ ents and adults .
the substitu@@ tion of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early mani@@ f@@ ici@@ ent lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate synthetic or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ate bam@@ yl@@ ase .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ uc@@ cin@@ ate deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ EX tablets may not be administ@@ ered with swal@@ lowing distur@@ ban@@ ces because there is a risk for the formation of o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ EX contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponds to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ NA@@ X should therefore only be used with cau@@ tion in patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium and o@@ dem@@ ag@@ ulation associated clinical conditions .
since the metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is over the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ NA@@ X should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ EX during pregnancy is therefore contr@@ ain@@ dic@@ ated ( see 4.3 ) .
in a sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it resulted in a s@@ lowing of neur@@ onal reproduction and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there also found a delayed irrit@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ t@@ ained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted by humans into the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ EX is contr@@ ain@@ dic@@ ated during l@@ act@@ ation ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least an unwanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of those undes@@ irable events were assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ EX .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ RO ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old Ang@@ ore@@ tic patient , which developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tat@@ ac@@ tin , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred during a 5 month old to@@ d@@ dler with a single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose @-@ limit@@ ing neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity in intrav@@ en@@ ous dos@@ ages of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active compound , con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via kid@@ neys .
but@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with u@@ rea compared ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the u@@ rea cycle can be assumed that for each gram the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ lu@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical results .
the prog@@ no@@ sis of early mani@@ f@@ ests with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ectious , and the disease even led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ a within the first year of life .
by means of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nit@@ rous oxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly substitu@@ tion of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ite enc@@ ephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time with many to mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest@@ ed form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ote form of the Or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy and afterwards treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kid@@ neys with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine arises .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine have been determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ ate in so@@ ber @-@ healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the u@@ rea cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following intrav@@ en@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form , 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing the plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were observed .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cyc@@ lic acid or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning after night fasting no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma can be det@@ ectable .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma tiles on the third day were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kid@@ neys .
after the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate had no cl@@ ast@@ o@@ ic effects with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ EX gran@@ ulate is taken either or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children who cannot swal@@ low tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing distur@@ ban@@ ces ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al onde .
the previous clinical experience is the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as adolesc@@ ents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the substitu@@ tion of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early mani@@ f@@ ici@@ ent lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate synthetic or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ate bam@@ yl@@ ase .
AM@@ NA@@ X gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if rat fl@@ utes were subjected to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite from phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) before birth , it came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the cer@@ eb@@ ral cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ RO ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old Ang@@ ore@@ tic patient , which developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tat@@ ac@@ tin , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
but@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with u@@ rea comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the u@@ rea cycle , it can be assumed that for each gram the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after the in@@ gest@@ ion of measured plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were observed .
during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
in this procedure the small measuring spo@@ on 0,95 g , the medium measuring spo@@ on 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ EX may also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen containing waste products , which accum@@ ulate after eating proteins in the body .
if you are looking for laboratory studies , you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ EX , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ RO with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs .

angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in inst@@ able Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different thick@@ nesses ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Lift &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measurement value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administ@@ ered and inf@@ usion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with a single gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) compared to conventional combination therapy with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI , patients often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
the treatment of ACS was angi@@ ox - with or without a gift of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who undergo a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as He@@ par@@ in regarding all indicators , except for severe ble@@ eding in which it was much more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine , other sh@@ ud@@ ine or other ingredients .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had a ble@@ eding , as well as with people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission approved the Medi@@ cines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the marketing authorisation of An@@ gi@@ ox in the whole European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is en@@ vis@@ aged .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intrav@@ en@@ ous stu@@ ff@@ ing of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0,25 mg / kg / h .
if one PCI is performed in another episode , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and inf@@ usion increases for the duration of the surgery to 1,75 mg / kg / h .
after the PCI , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0,25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a cap@@ tion of 0.5 mg / kg should be administ@@ ered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intrav@@ en@@ ous bol@@ us release of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intrav@@ en@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of an all@@ some bol@@ us administration of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value is short@@ ened to less than 225 seconds ( ACT after 5 minutes ) , a second bolt release should be 0.3 mg / kg / body weight .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ const@@ ituted and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and the dose is administ@@ ered intrav@@ en@@ ously intrav@@ en@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is administ@@ ered correctly .
in patients with severe kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine against ACS or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dosage of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administ@@ ered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose again .
in patients with severe kidney damage , included in the II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine @-@ Bol@@ us dosage without D@@ os@@ is@@ iz@@ ance on average 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contr@@ ain@@ dic@@ ated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intrav@@ en@@ ous gift of un@@ fr@@ active yeast or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other constitu@@ ents or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active ble@@ eding or increased blood supply risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ ost@@ atic system and / or ir@@ reversible co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders . • severe non @-@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ car@@ dit@@ is . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of ble@@ eding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine is administ@@ ered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if PCI @-@ patients suffer from bi@@ valent arter@@ ial points in most arter@@ ial points , patients with per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur during the treatment principle everywhere ble@@ eding occur .
in patients receiving War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine , a monitoring of the INR valu@@ ation ( International Ordin@@ ance R@@ atio ) should be taken into consideration to ensure that the value after setting the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine is again achieved prior to treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tic or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes aggreg@@ ates ) , this drug may increase the risk of blood .
in the combination of Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters are regularly checked regularly .
the experimental studies are in@@ adequate regarding the effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , development or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .

in both the Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine group as well as in the compar@@ ative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , patients were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients over 65 years .
severe ble@@ edings were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for severe ble@@ eding as defined in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and severe ble@@ eding performed significantly less often than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ den@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe ble@@ eding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age or ble@@ eding in the point zone , which required a radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , hem@@ at@@ oma with diameter ≥ 4 g / dl with known blood @-@ point , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood @-@ point , re@@ operation due to a ble@@ eding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
more , less frequently observed blood loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information on side effects are based on the data from a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine in 6000 patients who undergo a PCI .
in both the Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine group as well as in the compar@@ ative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , patients were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients over 65 years .
both light and severe ble@@ edings were significantly less common than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects not listed above have been reported after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed in table 6 following system organic classes .
in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine is immediately canc@@ eled and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of ble@@ eding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center and on the zone of the thro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or at the t@@ anning angle .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine on Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with it its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , on the one hand folds the binding of Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , through Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine with ser@@ um of patients with whom it had come to he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ose Syn@@ drome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , no thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes was indu@@ cing .

if one PCI was performed in the following cases , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5mg / kg of Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine was given and inf@@ usion increases for the duration of the surgery to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study un@@ fr@@ active He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administ@@ ered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with inst@@ able Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lift attack ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to receive a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or before beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or PCI .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolesc@@ ents and children from six years with diabetes who require treatment with ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm inj@@ ected or administ@@ ered as continuous inf@@ usion with an ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin to regulate the glu@@ cose level ( sugar ) in the blood or which ins@@ ulin does not work effectively .
ins@@ ulin L@@ ul@@ is@@ in is very slightly different from human ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter active time than a short @-@ acting human@@ in@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ term ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin , in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where the body ins@@ ulin is not processed effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the concentration of substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7,60 % to 7,@@ 46 % ) was determined in comparison to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in ins@@ ulin @-@ lis@@ pro .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0,46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.30 % in human normal ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ins@@ ulin or other components , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administ@@ ered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glu@@ cose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission approved San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH to grant asylum from A@@ pi@@ dra in the whole European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the del@@ ta , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous inf@@ usion into the area of the abdominal wall .
due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced ins@@ ulin change , ins@@ ulin demand in patients can be reduced with a restriction of liver function .
any changes in the volume , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the ins@@ ulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the method of manufacturing can undergo a change in ins@@ ulin requirements .
3 An in@@ adequate dosage or break@@ age of treatment , especially in patients with ins@@ ulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and di@@ abe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ; these states are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or ins@@ ulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change in the dosage required .
the time of occurrence of a hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used ins@@ ulin and can therefore change during conversion of the treatment scheme .
substances which can increase blood sugar concentration and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias are oral anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzy@@ me ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , di@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ en , s@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amid antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ic agents such as beta block@@ ers , Cl@@ oni@@ dine , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and Reser@@ vation the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c counter regulation can be weak@@ ened or ab@@ sent .
animal experimental studies on re@@ productive tox@@ icity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine and human ins@@ ulin in relation to pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether ins@@ ulin sensitivity occurs in human breast milk , but in general ins@@ ulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral application .

li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y Will fail to change the injection place continuously within the injection range , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y can occur in the injection point .
heavy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias involving un@@ consciousness can be treated with an intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an appropri@@ ately trained person , or treated with intrav@@ en@@ ous offering of glu@@ cose by a doctor .
after glu@@ cose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar ep@@ iso@@ des .
ins@@ ulin lowers blood sugar levels by stim@@ ulating peripher@@ al glu@@ cose absorption ( especially by skel@@ etal muscle and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glu@@ cose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of ins@@ ulin sensitivity occurs faster and the active time is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ ic normal ins@@ ulin .
in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , ins@@ ulin sensitivity in the therapeutic met@@ ering range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glu@@ cose level , and at 0.3 e / kg or more a propor@@ tion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cose level effect , just like human@@ in@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin L@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast as normal human ins@@ ulin and achieves the total glu@@ cose level of about 2 hours earlier than human ins@@ ulin .
from the data it was obvious that a comparable post@@ pran@@ ic gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control in an application of ins@@ ulin sensitivity is reached in 2 minutes before the meal , as with human normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
became ins@@ ulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ ic control was achieved than with human normal ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
