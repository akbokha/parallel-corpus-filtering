<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public assessment report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Human Use Medicinal Products (CHMP) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations on the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or their treatment, please read the prescription label (also included in the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like further information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that can be dissolved in the mouth) as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Actual thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and madness; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychic disease, in which patients have chronic episodes (periods of abnormal high-mood) alternately with periods of normal temperament.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat serious and severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased unrest or behavioural disturbances if oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be used for intake or the melting tablets in patients with difficulty getting the swallowing of tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, the same as Abilify should be adjusted, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances which enable the communication of the nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is probably above all known as "partial Agonist" for the receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole such as 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in lesser degree acts as the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, whereby psychotic or manic symptoms are reduced and their recurrence is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms was studied in three studies over up to a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased unrest, compared with a placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, to 160 patients with which the manic symptoms were already stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered an increased restlessness, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic fluid) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change of the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responded to treatment was examined.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body resorses the melting tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection solution showed patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased restlessness than the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application to treat bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes of previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrappyramidal disturbances, acathies (permanent movement), tremor (alcoholism), headache, blurry vision (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to serious manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder as well as prevention of a new manic episode in patients who were predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were addressed to the treatment with Aripiprazole, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in the fast control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder when oral therapy is not suitable compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission approved the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the marketing of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes associated with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 induction is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicide behavior is part of psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the start or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increased risk of suicide with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction, cardiac insufficiency, conduction disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions which predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acclaimed and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, reported occasional reports of dyskinesia during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients treated with Abilify occur signs and symptoms of late dyn, should be taken into consideration to reduce the dose or cancel the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or has unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all anti-psychotics, including Abilify, must be deposited.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in situations associated with cramplees.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had patients treated with Aripiprazole, an elevated risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dose, a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events with Aripiprazole treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyphagony, polyphagony and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar deficiency due to comorbidity, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effects of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overbearing side effects such as sedimentation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects, and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">With CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolic processes, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentration of Aripiprazole can result in comparison with CYP2D6 extensive metabolic processes.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should be outweighed for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects, and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be lifted to the dosage level before the beginning of the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be calculated with an moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextrometamoran / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (MRI) and 3A4 (dextrometamorphosis).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or are planning a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to insufficient data security for humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal reproductive studies, this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of operating dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripiprazole has no negative effect on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Aripiprazole, a total of lower incidence (25,8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, acathies, dystonia and dyskinesia compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57,3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23,5% was in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under semi-idol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment was 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, there were no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Side effects associated with an antipsychotic therapy, and about their occurrence also reported in treatment with Aripiprazole, include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesis and crampfancases, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the launch, unintentional or deliberate overdosages with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg. and without deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemostalysis treatment in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose as Aripiprazol has a high plasma cutting binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripiprazol showed a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and the serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a-receptor as well as an even affinity to the dopamine D4-, to serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine-H1Recitor.</seg>
<seg id="76">At the administration of Aripiprazole in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3-receptor ligand, at the nucleus caudatus and at the putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant increase in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol-controlled trial in week 52, the proportion of responder patients who retained a response to the study mediation was similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurement scales, defined as secondary study destinations, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- DepressionsRate Scales, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of relapses, which was at 34% in the Aripiprazol group and at 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin controlled, multinational double blind study at schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients affected and in which the primary study target was' weight gain 'occurred in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the baseline value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazol showed a efficacy in week 3 versus placebo effect, comparable to that of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, in week 12 Aripiprazol showed a comparable percentage of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which sometimes over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirror, the companion therapy with Aripiprazole surpassed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole versus placebo over the prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in the prevention of a relapse in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the Dehydration and Hydroxymethylation of Aripiprazol, the N-Dealkyfication is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination duration is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole with extensive metabolic systems via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours at 'bad' (= "poor") metabolic devices via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, and the pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients showed no gender-related effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A population-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different radial liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function in Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, and canoogenic potential, preclinical data cannot detect any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological significant effects only have been observed in doses or expositions which exceed the maximum dosage or exposure of humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects cover a dose-dependent adrenal rinse toxicity (lipofuscin pigmentation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3-10 times of middle steady state exposure (AUC) at 60 mg / kg / day (that's 10times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a Cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates from Aripiprazol in the Galle of Monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the medium steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81multiply of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of found concentrations of the Sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- Aripiprazol are not more than 6% of the concentrations observed in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of Monkeys, and are far below the limits (6%) of the vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages which led to expositions of the 3- and 11fold of the mean steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="143">Abilify injection solution is used to quickly control agiteness and behavior in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="144">Once it is clinically appropriate, the treatment with Aripiprazole injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="145">In order to increase resorption and minimize variability, an injection in the M. deltoideus or deeply into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended under circumvention of adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment with Aripiprazole is indicated, see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abilify tablets, Abilify Melting tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the efficacy of Aripiprazol injection solution in patients with agiteness and behavioural disturbances caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If a parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines in addition to the Aripiprazol injection solution is deemed necessary, patients should be observed with regard to an extreme sedation or a blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, there were no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases of CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects associated with an antipsychotic therapy, and about their occurrence also reported in treatment with Aripiprazole, include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesis and crampfancases, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agitation and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms in terms of agitation and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement of the mean improvement of the baseline at the PANSS Excitement Component score in the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5,8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8,7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of sub-groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agiteness, a similar activity was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant increase in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a Haloperidol-controlled trial in week 52, the proportion of responder patients who retained a response to the study mediation was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which approximately three quarters earlier obtained an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration or as monotherapy) was compared with the drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, in the main study 72 (31%) of the 229 with Abraxane patients responded to treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients who were treated with conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">Looking at the patients who were first treated for metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the medicines in relation to efficacy indicator such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>

<seg id="273">The Medicinal Products Committee (CHMP) stated that the first treatment was not more effective than conventional paclitaxel, and that in contrast to other paclitaxel, it does not have to be given to other medicines to reduce side-effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission issued the European Commission Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the marketing of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients in which the first-line treatment for metastatic disease is failed and is not indicated for standard anthracycline treatment (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils) &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2.</seg>

<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunction (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly identified kardiotoxicity is not detected, cardiac incidents are not unusual in the indicated patient collective, especially in patients with early anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or pulmonary disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If patients after the administration of abrasion, vomiting and diarrhoea occur, they can be treated with the usual antiemetics and counter-stipulating methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used during pregnancy or women in childbearing age, which do not apply effective contraception, except treatment of mother with paclitaxel is unavoidable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxanes are advised to testify during and up to six months after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised before treatment, because the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very common) and dizziness (common), which can affect the perseverance and ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">Listed below are the most common and most important incidents of side-effects that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic mammacarcinoma who were treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in the pivotal phase III trial.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported to 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl) in three cases.</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the gift of Abraxanes as monotherapy at each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased liquor hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, elevated phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue-burn, dry mouth, pain of gums, loose stools, oesophagitis, pain in the abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding diseases of kidneys and urinary passages:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of musculature, headache, pain, pain in skeletal musculature, side pain, discomfort in limbs, muscle weakness Very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in context in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, there are no estimates of the actual frequency and no causal connection with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubules active substance, which promotes the accumulation of microtubules from the tubular indimations and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting their decolonisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization results in an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin conveys the Transzytosis of plasmacenes into the endothelial cells and in the framework of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transidothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumen receptor and due to albumin protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) occurs a paclitaxel accumulation in the field of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic mammacarcinoma is supported by data of 106 patients in two unarmed and non-verbal studies and of 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic mammacarcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multi-centric study was conducted in patients with metastatic mammacarcinoma who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent-based paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premediation to prevent an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion without premediation (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a negative general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastatic disease and 19% due to metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First-Line therapy are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy Grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy towards blades on baseline based on the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active ingredients (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After intravenous administration of Abraxanes in patients with metastatic mammacarcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration took off in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumors, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-based paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">Aclitaxel's clearance was higher (43%) after the Abraxane dosage (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel and also the distribution volume was higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue coating, Paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxyapaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxanes in patients with metastatic mammacarcinoma, the mean value for cumulative urea deposition was 4% of the total dose of the total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal Clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available to patients aged more than 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">Chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in front of bright light for 8 hours.</seg>

<seg id="359">"" "this means that seamed is similar to a biological medicinal product that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active substance (also called" "" "reference medicinal products" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood iron levels where a blood transfusion might occur if a blood circulation is not possible and where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with seamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self-blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor, provided they have received an appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists, and iron supplements should be given during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by an erythropoietal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietine.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietine is also applied before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was produced, which it empowers for the formation of epetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with administered intravenous injections as part of a major study with 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by anaemia, compared to the reference doctor.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected for at least eight weeks Eprex / Erypo in a vein before they were either converted to seamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of the efficacy was the change of hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period between 25 and 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study investigating the effects of seamed seamed seamed with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from kidney problems anaemia suffered, the hemoglobin values of patients who were converted to seamed were kept in the same measure as in those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">Compared to this, patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is a rise in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of an encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, constant migrant headache and turbulence.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed should not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epetin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Seamed as injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems, as further studies are required to ensure that this is caused by no allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Medicinal Products Committee (CHMP) concluded that according to the provisions of the European Union, evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile, such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that manufactures seamed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all member states including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>

<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion needs in adults with solid tumors, malignant lymphoma or multiplem myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of a transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, previously existing anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6,2 - 8,1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency) if blood-sparing measures are not available or insufficient, with planned bigger surgical procedures which require large blood volumes (4 or more units blood in women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>

<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected loss of blood of 900-1800 ml, which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7,5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients, where the hemoglobin concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l) should lie.</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall illness; therefore, the evaluation of individual clinical trial and disease condition is required by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient via or under the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value exceeds 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epetin alfa is applied in the lowest permitted dosage, which is required for the control of anaemia and the angioma symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">These clinical results indicate that patients with initial very low pH value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">These clinical results indicate that patients with initial very low pH value (&lt; 6.9 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.4 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in increments of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms and consequences may vary depending on age, gender and overall illness; therefore, the evaluation of individual clinical trial and disease condition is required by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epetin alfa is applied in the lowest permitted dosage, which is required for the control of the angioma symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of hemoglobin value by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte value increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / kilns against the baseline, the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin rise &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the reticulocyte value increased &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the output value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week of hemoglobin value to ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte value, the dose should be maintained three times a week three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the baseline value, an appeal to the epetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%) in which the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood conduction is required should be received in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should be started as early as possible - for example, a few weeks before the start of autologous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available before the seamed therapy begins.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg Epetin alfa, which should be given once weekly over three weeks (Day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of intervention (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">In this case, epetin alfa should be given pre-operatively 300 I.U. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis via the hose of a fistle, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine into circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients receiving treatment with any erythropoetin on erythroblastopenia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive seamed or other erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastopenia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. anamnestically known venous thromboemboids).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients envisaged for a larger elective orthopedic procedure and which can not participate in an autologous blood donation program, the application of epetin alfa is contraindicated in the following advantages, accompanying or oral diseases, periphere arterial vascular disease, vascular disease of the carototides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently inserted heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastopenia (PRCA) Very rare has been reported about the occurrence of an anticoated PRCA after month- to years-long treatment with subcutaneous Erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of effect, defined as reduction of hemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes for non-speaking (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminum oxide toxication, infections or inflammations, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticulocyte value, considering anemia (i.e. the reticulocytes "index"), is humiliated (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), the platelets and leukocytes are normal, and if no other cause of an active loss is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone marrow will be considered to be diagnosed with a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of seamed in patients with a risk of an antibody induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In case of chronic renal insufficiency patients should not exceed the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration under Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies an increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular incidents were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical trials have demonstrated no significant benefit that is due to the administration of epetines when the hemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required for the control of the symptoms and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin rise should amount to about 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive insufficiency, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentrations should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to recent findings, the treatment of anaemia with epetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">Tumour patients with chemotherapy should be considered a 2 - 3 week delay between epetin-alfa administration and erythropoetin response (patients who may have to be transacted) for the evaluation of the treatment effectiveness of epetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is greater than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapies with the aim of keeping the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk reduction based on the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients envisaged for a larger elective orthopedic procedure, if possible, prior to the beginning of the epoetin alfa therapy, the cause of anaemia is examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a greater elective orthopaedic procedure should receive adequate thromblosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, particularly in a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epetin alfa for patients with an initial hemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl, an increased risk for postoperative thrombotic / vascular events can persist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epetins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer received chemotherapy, when a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8,7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>

<seg id="571">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease.</seg>
<seg id="572">As the active ingredient in Aclasta is the same as in Zometa, a part of the data material for Zometa was used to evaluate Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="573">In the first study, nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved in osteoporosis, and the number of spine and hip fractures was examined over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="574">The second study included two 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years, who have recently suffered a hip fracture; it was examined the number of fractures over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">At Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies on a total of 357 patients and compared with Risedronat (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that builds bone substance) in the blood again normalized or decreased by at least 75% compared to the baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of vertebral fractures was reduced by 70% in patients under Aclasta (without other osteoporosis treatments) over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="578">The risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41% compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis treatments).</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study with men and women with hip fracture, 9% of the patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients under placebo (139 by 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent with repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledronic acid or other bisphosphonates or other constituents.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonate patients, patients at Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion point and osteoneksis (dying of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclasta provides information for doctors who prescribe Aclasta for treating osteoporosis, as well as similar material for patients in which the drug side effects are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package is to be provided and include the following key messages: • The prescription • contraindication in pregnancy and breastfeeding women • Required of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, the non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When using medical or nursing care is</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men an intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">For patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture the administration of the infusion of aclerxes is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of hip fractures (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment of the Morbus Paget with Aclasta, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is very advisable in patients with Morbus Paget a sufficient supply of calcium, corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elementar calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. orally or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days following the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by means of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after applying Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with renal dysfunction (see section 4.4) For patients with a creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended because there are limited clinical experiences for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, since data are absent to harmlessness and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended for patients with severe renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia is treated before beginning of therapy with Aclasta by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid deployment of the effect of citric acid on bone structure, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable in patients with Morbus Paget a sufficient supply of calcium, corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elementar calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer disease, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids (poor oral hygiene) should be considered a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment before using bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who require dental intervention, no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonate reduces the risk of osteonitis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced by means of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of worsening cases of atrial fibrillation in cases of atrial fibrillation was increased (1.3%) (51%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0,6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2,6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction coledronic acid was associated with kidney function disturbances, which expressed itself as a decrease in the renal function (i.e. an increase in the serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatinine Clearance (measured before the administration) and the appearance of kidney failure as well as a limited kidney function were comparable in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years compared to the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in the serum creatine within 10 days of offering was observed at 1.8% of the patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the assessment of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values, which were below the normal swelling range (less than 2.10 mmol / l), were compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus Paget trials.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received supplementary sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study on preventing clinical fractures following a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recent hip fracture, the vitamin D mirrors were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After the administration of Zoledronic acid in a large clinical trial was reported via local reactions to the infusion point, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, reported (0,7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonics in the jaw area, especially in cancer patients, over osteonecroses (primarily in the jaw area), reported cases that were treated with bisphosphonate, including coledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteoporitis, and the majority of reports referring to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study of 7,736 patients performed osteonecrose in a jaw area with an Aclasta and a placebo-treated patient.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of an overdose which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown with either a bone density value (BMD) -T-Score for the Schenkelhals ≤ -2,5 with or without any signs of an existing vertebral body structure.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric cardiac fractures Aclasta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after a year the frequency of one or several new vertebral body structures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients of 75 years and older had a reduced risk of spinal body fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta had a constant effect over three years which resulted in a reduced risk of hip fractures in one by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased the bone density at the lumbar vertebrate, hip and distal radius compared to the placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the entire hip by 6.0%, the thigh hash by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology At 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), a year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvic ridge.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputerised tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume compared to placebo and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone substitute markers The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale prop of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C-telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were specified in sub-groups from 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the duration of the study.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual dose of 5 mg Aclasta reduced BSAP in 12 months significantly by 30% compared to baseline value and was kept at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was reduced significantly by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was reduced significantly by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D mirrors were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) in the HORIZON-RFT study increased the Aclasta treatment compared to placebo treatment compared to placebo treatment at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment took over 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase BMD by 5.4% at the overall level and 4.3% at the femoral neck.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study, 508 men were randomised and 185 patients evaluated the BMD after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once weekly administration of Aclasta was not inferior to the percentage change in the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was examined in patients aged over 30 years with radiological confirmed, above all light to moderately heavy Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum-mirror of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2.6fold to 3.0fold age-specific upper normal value when recording into the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of citric acid in comparison to intake of 30 mg of risedronate once a day during 2 months has been proven in two six months comparison studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the baseline value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responder at the end of the six month main study (responded to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 with Aclasta and the 107 patients with Risedronat, patients who participated in the follow-up study could maintain the therapeutic response at 141 of patients with Aclasta, compared to 71 patients treated with Risedronat, during an average duration of follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-off and multiple 5-15 minutes lasting infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data that proved to be dosed independently.</seg>
<seg id="646">Then the plasma bar quickly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long lasting phase of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphase disappearance from the large circulation system with half-life times t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ β amateways, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminale elimination time t ½ γ 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) probably represent the rapid resorption in the bones and the excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 h, 39 ± 16% of the given dose can be found in the urine, while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body Clearance is independent of the dose of 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the coledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the surface below the curve (plasma concentration vs. time).</seg>
<seg id="652">Reduced Clearance by cytochrome P450 enzyme-enzyme metabolized substances is unlikely because Zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or not direct and / or irreversible, material-changing inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledron acid correlated with the creatine-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatine-Clearance, and amounted to 84 ± 29 ml / min (range from 22 to 143 ml / min) in 64 patients.</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and an excessive renal dysfunction down to a creatinin clearance up to 35 ml / min requires no dose adjustment of the coledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since for severe kidney dysfunction (creatinin Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letal intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies in dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC were the 6fold of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Sub-chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of Zoledronic acid in rats was administered in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose, equivalent to the 6fold of the human-therapeutic exposure, corresponding to the AUC, corresponding to the AUC, corresponds to), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in accumulated expositions, which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects occurred in other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as intravenous injections.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common finding in trials with repeated application was an increased primary Spongiosa in the metaphyse of long bones for animals in the growth phase with nearly all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, antiresortive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">At rats one observed a teratogenicity of doses from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">Rabbits did not observe teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to lower serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, mainly estrogens made of androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">At the Morbus Paget the bone structure takes place too fast, and new bone-material is constructed unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta acts by normalising the bone structure, thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus gives again strength to the bone.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public assessment report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Human Use Medicinal Products (CHMP) reviewed the studies conducted to make recommendations on the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients), where metformin (a diabetic medication) is not indicated. • It can be applied together with another diabetic medication (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can also be applied to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dosage.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl resin or insulin, the current dose of the sulfonyl resin or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of the sulphonic resin or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood glucose level decreases, allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in Tripletherapy was studied; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl resin, in addition they received either actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which suggests that blood glucose levels were reduced in application of doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional administration of Actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl resins decreased by 0.94%, while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study where the combination of Actos and insulin was studied in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin have reduced the HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, infections of the upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hypoanesthesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos should not be used in patients who may react very sensitively (allergic) to pioglitazone or other components in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high level of ketone - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients with metformin.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission approved Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for the marketing of accounts in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and in which metformin is unsuitable due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, so the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from at least a risk factor (e.g. early heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazon in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">Euromonitor International has over 30 years experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are as soon as possible to control.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, upliftment, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or darker urine, are the liver enzyme values to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision, whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pioglitazon, should be led by the clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are submitted.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain was detected, which can be stirred by fatty deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a minor reduction of middle hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the treatment with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes have been observed in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3.6-4.1%) and to a lesser extent also in patients under Sulfonylharnstoff and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients receiving pioglitazon as oral two-fold or triple combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the launch, the treatment with thiazolid indicons, including Pioglitazon, was reported on a occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report about disorders of visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events related to fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 Fraktur for 100 patient-years in patients treated with Pioglitazon and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient-years in women treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years of cardiovascular incidence, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazon, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or does this, the treatment is to be deposited (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the interactions have shown that Pioglitazon does not have any relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with pharmaceuticals that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, Cyclosporin, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazon by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-inducted) resulted in a reduction in the AUC of Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that the treatment with Pioglitazon reduces the hyperinsulinemia resulting in pregnancy and increased the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (from this data not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgum and the refraction of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT-Anstiege frequently appeared on the triangle of the upper limit of the normal range, but less often than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyl resins.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency was 1.6% higher than under placebo if pioglitazon or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its introduction, it has rarely been reported on cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazon, but more frequently when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">There was a summary analysis of adverse events related to fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in patients treated with pioglitazon and more than 7,400 patients in patients with comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the study conducted over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5,1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazon, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day more than seven days, no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to be activated by activating specific receptors (Peroxisome proliferation), which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy has been continued over two years in order to investigate the time until progression of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the therapy a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazon at 69% of the patients treated (compared to 50% of the patients below Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled trial for 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite a three-month optimization phase with insulin was randomised to pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with Pioglitazon, the medium HbA1c decreased by 0.45% compared to those who received insulin only; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, Pioglitazon showed a statistically significant decrease in albumin / Kreatinin quotients compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18 week study of type 2 diabetic patients.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo, a reduction of overall plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- Cholesterinspiegel, as well as a minor, however, clinically not significantly increased LDL Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced overall plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or glide azide.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, there was no statistically significant increase in LDL Cholesterinspiegel in Pioglitazon, while under metformin and Gliclazid decreased values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the Nüchtern triglycerides but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, both on triglyceride absorption and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients were randomised in groups with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced macrovascular disease in groups who received either pioglitazon or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentrations of unmodified pioglitazon in plasma usually reach 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to efficacy in approximately three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8-inducted) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive Pioglitazon in humans, the marker was found mainly in the waste (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination duration of unmodified pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of pioglitazon and its metabolites is lower in patients with reduced renal function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral Clearance of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anaemia and reversibly eccentric cardiac hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that the treatment with Pioglitazone diminishes the hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidences of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) were induced by the urinary bladder epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other Thiazolid indians resulted in increased incidence of colontal tumours.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years of cardiovascular incidence, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazon, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with pioglitazon or gliclazide were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, Pioglitazon showed a statistically significant decrease in albumin / Kreatinin quotients compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the Nüchtern triglycerides but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, both through an effect on Tryglyceride absorption and the epatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the target with regard to its primary endpoint, which presented a combination of the overall mortality, non-deadly myocardial infarction, stroke amputation, above the ankle, coronary vascularisation and Revascularization of the leg arteries, suggest that the intake of pioglitazon is not associated with cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>

<seg id="869">The Committee on Human Use Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Actrafane in the treatment of diabetes were outweighed to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission approved Novo Nordisk A / S to grant approval for the marketing of Actrafane in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily if a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood glucose level has improved significantly due to an intensified insulin therapy, the hypoglycemia warning symptoms can be altered and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphase, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA against insulin origin) may cause a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Actaphane in the patient, it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the changeover.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients, in which hypoglycemic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin, reported that early warning symptoms of a hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling, which pass over several time zones, the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his doctor, as such journeys can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in therapy and always consult his patients with other medicines taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, which can occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetic therapy increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Heavy hypoglycemias may lead to unconsciousness and / or seizures and end with temporary or permanent disruptions of the brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Disorders of the nervous system Actually - peripheral neuropathy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort that are referred to as acute painful neuropathy and usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 A intensification of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement of blood sugar can however be associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Diseases of the skin and the underdog tissue Actually - Lipodystrophy An the injection point can develop a lipodystrophy when it was missed to change the piercing points within the injection range.</seg>
<seg id="884">General diseases and complaints at the place of suppressors - Local hypersensitivity reactions to the injection site During the insulin therapy, local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, soreness and haematoma can occur at the injection point).</seg>
<seg id="885">Disorders of the immune system Actually - Urticaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms generated hypersensitivity, including generalized rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angioneurotic eyelid, heartbeat, low blood pressure and impotence / unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">A hypoglycemia can however develop gradually: • Light hypoglycemias may be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape-sugars, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Heavy hypoglycemias involving unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a designated aid person or by glucose which is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of the activity is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of split (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration; none of the metabolites formed by splitting is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended to increase the temperature of insulin at room temperature (not over 25 ° C) before it is discharged according to the instruction manual for the first use.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients, in which hypoglycemic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin, reported that early warning symptoms of a hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>

<seg id="1174">The main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose uric acid levels were in the blood during the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1175">In the first study, 48% (126 of 262) of patients who took Adenuric in a dose of once daily 80 mg, and 65% (175 of 269) patients who once daily took 120 mg once daily, in the last three measurements a uric acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1176">Compared to this, this was 22% (60 of 268) patients under Allopurinol and none of the 134 patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of Adenuric (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, diarrhea, nausea (nausea), rash and abnormal liver values.</seg>
<seg id="1178">In particular in patients with heart complaints in the prehistory, there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Human Use Committee (CHMP) concluded that Adenuric could be more effective in lowering the uric acid in the blood than allopurinol, but also a higher risk of side-effects related to the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in diseases which have already led to urine deposits (including one from the patient's history known or currently available gout node and / or arthritis).</seg>
<seg id="1181">If the serum acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) after 2-4 weeks, a dose increase can be considered to ADENURIC 120 mg 1 times a day.</seg>
<seg id="1182">In patients with severe kidney function, efficacy and safety have not been completely examined (creatine clearance &lt; 30 ml / min, see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1183">Children and adolescents There are no experiences in children and adolescents, the use of Febuxostat is not recommended in this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Organ transplant receptor Since there are no experiences in organ transplant recipients, the use of Febuxostat is not recommended in this patient group (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">Cardiovascular disease If patients with ischemic heart disease or decompression heart failure are not recommended, treatment is not recommended with Febuxostat (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other haric-growing pharmaceuticals, there may be an acute gout attack during the treatment course, because by lowering the serum resin acid, uric acid deposits can first be mobilized in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="1187">B. for malignant diseases and their treatment, Lesch- Nyhan's syndrome), the absolute concentration of Xanthin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a storage in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Liver disease During Phase 3 clinical studies, slight collutions of liver function values were observed in patients with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before beginning of February and continue in the course of clinical findings (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophyllin Zwar did not have an exchange rate studies on Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibition could lead to an increase in theophylline level (a inhibition of the metabolism of Theophyllin was also reported for other XO-inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">At Probanden, the simultaneous offering of Febuxostat and naproxen was 250 mg 2 times a day associated with an increase in February (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical studies the application of naproxen or other NSAR / cox-2 inhibitors was not related to a clinically significant increase of adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorinthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without requiring a dose adjustment for Febuxostat or at the same time used other active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study with study subjects, 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x daily a mean 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 medium, indicating a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antacid It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of an antacid, which contains magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, retarded the absorption of Febuxostat (about 1 hour) and a decrease in Cmax by 32%, but no significant change in AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data on a very limited number of exponated pregnancies do not include side effects of Febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect harm to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle, serving machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can be reasonably confident that ADENURIC did not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular incidence was observed in Phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term extension studies (1,4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal connection with Febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors detected in these patients were an arteriosklerotic illness and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensated cardiac insufficiency in the patient's history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) side effects, which could arise in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Feb. at more than once reported, are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients treated with colchicine. * * In clinical trials, no severe rashes or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">7 Open long-term extension studies In the open long-term extension studies, 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year, 322 patients up to 2 years long, 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1204">Treatment-related events reported during the long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported in all February treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patients), according to the indications, occasionally.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported in the pivotal studies of Phase 3 for these doses or with a smaller frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, sleeplessness, hypaesthesia, conspicuous ECG, cough, smoothness, skin irritation, kidney failure, kidney failure, renal insufficiency in the blood, increase in potassium concentration in the blood, decrease in lymphocytes, decrease in the number of white blood cells.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Reaction mechanism uric acid is the final product of the purinmetry in humans and results in the reaction process hypoxanthin → Xanthin → uric acid.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Febuxostat is a powerful non-selective inhibitor of XO (NP-SIxO) with a Ki value for the in vitro-hemming that lies below the nanomolar area.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Clinical study results The efficacy of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies in Phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were performed with 1.832 patients with hyperuricaemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint was in every study the proportion of patients with which the last three month-specific serum acid levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="1212">Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 267), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 258), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 10) for patients with a serum increatinate to study starts of &gt; 1,5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed the statistically significant superiority of the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg. 1 times daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg. 1 times daily compared to the treatment with conventionally used doses of allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed the statistically significant superiority of the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg. 1 times daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg. 1 times daily compared to the treatment with the conventionally used dose Allopurinol 300 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1219">With ADENURIC, the primary efficacy endpoint was 44% (80 mg 1 times daily), 45% (120 mg 1 times daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences with regard to the percentage reversal of serum-acid concentrations in subjects, regardless of their renal function (58% in group with normal kidney function and 55% in group with severe kidney dysfunction).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of 40% of patients (APEX- and FACT study) had a serum-acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the serum resin acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) showed that less than 3% of patients required 16-24 treatment against a delay (i.e. more than 97% of patients needed no treatment against a delay).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the gout node size, which in 54% of the patients had a complete disappearance of the gout nodes up to month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- Values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients who received long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also received in patients who received Allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increased from Febuxostat to administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose-proportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Febuxostat an increase in AUC, which is larger than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simpler or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg. 1 times daily, the Cmax amounts to about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage reduction of serum resin concentrations, if this was checked (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume (Vss / F) of Febuxostat lies between 29 and 75 l after intake of doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma cut binding of Febuxostat amounts to approx. 99.2% (primary binding to albumin) and is constant over the concentration width, which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1232">After taking a 80 mg dose of 14C-selected Febuxostat about 49% of the dose was found in the urine as unmodified Febuxostat (3%), Acylglucuronid of the active ingredient (30%), its well-known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%) and other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over the urine, approximately 45% of the dose was found in the chair as unmodified Febuxostat (12%), Acylglucuronid of the active ingredient (1%), its well-known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%) as well as other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Special patient groups kidney failure after taking multiple doses of 80 mg of ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the Cmax of Febuxostat did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The mean total AUC of Febuxostat increased about 1.8-fold of 7.5 μ g ⋅ h / ml in group with normal kidney function at 13.2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>

<seg id="1237">Age There were no significant changes with regard to the AUC of Febuxostat or its metabolites after taking multiple oral doses of ADENURIC in older patients compared to younger subjects.</seg>
<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats, a statistically significant increase of urinary bladder tumors (transitional cell papillomas and carcinomas) were found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dosed treated group, with approximately 11 times the exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are considered as a result of specialised purple metabolization and urine composition, and considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It has been found that Febostostat in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproduction performance of male and female rats.</seg>
<seg id="1241">In high doses, which were approximately 4-fold of the human therapeutic exposure, maternal Toxicity occurred, the associated with a reduction of the breeding performance and a developmental delay in the descendants of rats.</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you keep the uric acid concentration low by the 1 x daily intake of ADENURIC, the formation of the crystals is prevented and in this way a reduction of discomfort is achieved with time.</seg>
<seg id="1256">ADENURIC may not be taken, if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredient of Febuxostat or any of the other components of ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Inform your doctor before you begin taking this medication, • if you have a cardiac weakness or have or suffer from any other heart problem. • If you are treated due to high uric acid concentration as a result of cancer illness or the Lesch Nyhan-syndrome (a rare congenital disease in which too much uric acid is found in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="1258">If you have a gout attack at the moment (sudden appearance of severe pain, sensitivity, redness, heat sensation and joint swelling), wait until the attack is cleared before you start treatment with ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1259">This does not have to be with everyone, but may also occur with you, especially during the first treatment weeks or - months, when you take ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1260">Your doctor will prescribe other medicines to you if necessary to treat a gout attack or to treat the symptoms associated with it (such as pain and joint swelling).</seg>
<seg id="1261">Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently been used / used, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1262">It is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking drugs / apply one of the following substances, as interactions with ADENURIC may occur and your doctor may want to consider necessary measures. • Theophyllin (for the treatment of asthma) • Warfarin (for blood dilution in heart disease)</seg>
<seg id="1263">No studies have been carried out on the effects of ADENURIC on the impermeability and ability to operate machinery.</seg>

<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient may not lie until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since Alendronat and vitamin D3 are already separately used in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union, the company presented data from earlier studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to prove efficacy of ADROVANCE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE were lower (11%) than those who took Alendronat (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data that show that the Alendronat dosage contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose needed to prevent a bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of musculoskeletal disorders (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive apparatus such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (diarrhoea), ulculence (ulceration), ulcers (ulcera), tumulatory abdomen (blocked stomach) as well as acid disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) against alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other components, ADROVANCE cannot be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It should not be applied in case of diseases of the esophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot stand up or sit for at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1288">Follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and related side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• At the end of the day ADROVANCE should only be swallowed with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml). • The patients should not chew the tablet or put the tablet in the mouth as a risk for oropharyngeal ulcera occurs. • The patients should not sit before the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptal ulcers, active gastrointestinal hemorrhages or surgical procedures in the upper Gastrointestinal tract, except for pyloroplasty, are given only under special caution (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as oesophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal strokes, were reported in patients under the intake of Alendronat (partially these severe and required a hospital instruction).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible malignal reactions, and patients should be advised to reduce symptoms of esophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain in swallowing or retrostar pain or new or worsening heartburn the medicine and seek medical advice (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of serious esophageal side-effects seems to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical trials with Alendronat no increased risk was detected, stomach and duodenal ulcera, among them some severe and with complications, were reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteoneksis of the jaw, usually related to a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteoporitis), was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimen mostly administered intravenously administered bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available to indicate whether the use of bisphosphonate therapy in patients with a shale surgical procedure decreases the risk of osteoneksis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">The clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapeutic planning of each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed that they should take the dose of ADROVANCE after taking a dose of ADROVANCE after having noticed their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets on the same day, but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the day of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidal melanin) should also be treated adequately before beginning of therapy with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronat foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines can impair the resorption of alendronate if taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, after taking Alendronat, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not conducted, Alendronat was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore neither used during pregnancy nor of lactating women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with Alendronat leave no indication of directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteoneksis of the jaw was reported in patients with bisphosphonate; most reports originate from cancer patients, but also for osteoporosis patients it was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Nevertheless the serum calcium decreased to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl (2,0 mmol / l) and serum phosphate to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) in both treatment groups with similar frequency.</seg>
<seg id="1309">Alendronat's sequence of oral overdose can occur hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and side effects in the upper Gastrointestinal tract such as stomach upset, heartburn, ecophagitis, gastritis or ulcera.</seg>

<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical study were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplantation, comparing the application of Advagraf with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with whom the transplant was graded after a year of treatment (for example examining how often a renewed organ transplant or a resumption of the dialysis was required).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, recent studies on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation have been carried out and examined how Advocraf is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only physicians who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or an increased incidence of side effects, including under- or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the close-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a change to alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood level requirements (see below "Recommendations")</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus test mirrors should be checked before the changeover and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Day 4 was the systemic exposure, measured as a valley mirror, with both formulations in both kidney and liver transplant patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus test mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advocross to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate post-transplantation phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with low Clearance, an adaptation of the Advagraf Dosisscheme can take several days until the steady state is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application For the suppression of the graft rejection, immunosuppression has to be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendations - kidney transplantation Prophylaxis of transplant repulsion The oral Advagraf therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Other dose adjustments may be necessary later, as the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change in the course of the stabilization of the patient following the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplantation Prophylaxis of transplant repulsion The oral Advagraf therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - change from Prograf to Advagraf must be converted from Prograf capsules to a daily dose of Prograf capsules once daily intake of Advagraf, so this conversion has to be done in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg), based on the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After switching from other immunosuppressants to advagraf once a day, the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for the prophylaxis of graft rejection is recommended once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Transplantation In case of adult patients, which are converted to advagraf, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with advagraf in lung, pancreatic and intestine-transplanted patients, occurred in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0,15 mg / kg / day, in pancreatic-transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function In order to maintain blood tallow in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function Since the renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of Tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum creatinin levels, a calculation of the creatinine and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus-based therapy, caution is required (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the descent of the general blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases, under the assistance of thoroughbred-Tacrolimus-Talspiegel-controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform common checks of the Tacrolimus test levels during the first two weeks following transplantation followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood Talking of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, dosage adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or for simultaneous use of substances, which could change the Tacrolimus complete blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low clearance, adaptations of the dose may need several days until the steady state has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels of the talons do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the descent of Tacrolimus in the first time after liver transplantation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in the case of glulting and heart-transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which can occur in a sequence of tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the close-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be effective against other immunosuppressants, there are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients in the child age, there are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions, which can lead to a reduction of the tacrolimuscular levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements which contain currants (hypericum perforatum), or other herbal remedies during treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus- concentrations in the blood is provided as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to significant fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a chamber or septum-hypertrophy described as cardiomyopathy was observed, which can therefore also occur under Advocephaly.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, liquid overload and ecology.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, the effects of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malignant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sun protection using a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of drugs or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore advisable to monitor the Tacrolimus- blood levels in simultaneous dispensing of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolic rate and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain even better concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics have reported that the increase in blood levels is mainly due to the increased oral bioavailability of Tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High-dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other tacrolimus drugs is known as CYP3A4 inhibition; therefore, the simultaneous use of Tacrolimus can be metabolized with drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As Tacrolimus will descend the Clearance of steroid contraceptives and thereby increase the hormone exposition, it is particularly careful when making decisions about contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal testing have shown that Tacrolimus can potentially reduce the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and prolongs its half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients do not suggest that under Tacrolimus, compared to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn on possible harmful effects of Tacrolimus (especially concerning its effect on the kidneys) is recommended.</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported on benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours associated with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that Tacrolimus is not dialysiable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects On the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus can be mediated by its binding to a cytosolic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enrichment of the connection in the cellular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transductions in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain number of lymphoma genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus oppresses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of the B cells dependent on T-helper cells (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ -interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin 2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral Prograf in these published studies reviewed the observations in the large studies where Prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in the Prograf in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recent, multi-centric study with oral Prograf was reported more than 110 patients who received either Tacrolimus or Ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Also a chronic graft rejection, broncholitis obliterans- syndrome, was less frequently observed in the first year after transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus- and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with Tacrolimus there was 21.7% of cases in the formation of broncholitis obliterans compared to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be changed to tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly larger (p = 0.02) than the number of patients that were converted from Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection, was after 6 months (57,7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the lung transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In a study the frequency of the formation of broncholitis obliterates was significantly lower with the patients treated with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreatic transplantation A multi-centric trial with oral Prograf was performed on 205 patients who received a pancreatic and kidney transplant that were randomised in Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initialdosis (per protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached after reaching the target levels of 8 to 15 ng / ml at 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Intestinal transplantation The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral Prograf as primary immunosuppressant after colorectal transplants showed a current survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low hematocrites and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the disbanded faction of Tacrolimus, or a gain of metabolism induced by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This allows tacrolimus to be almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the excretion occurs mainly via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients that were converted from Prograf (twice a day) to Advocraf (once a day) in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg), the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to perform common checks of the Tacrolimus test levels during the first two weeks following transplantation followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be effective against other immunosuppressants, there are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advocate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a blood clotting disorder due to the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application are aimed at whether advocates are used for the treatment of bleeding or for prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor of VIII deficiency, causing blood clots like bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but according to a method called "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to empower it to the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is otherwise produced, so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was examined for prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the effectiveness of advocates in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood sepisodes was "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advance may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human tanning factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission issued Baxter AG a permit for the marketing of lawyers in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage: dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, according to the location and extent of blood supply and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity in the appropriate period should not fall below the specified plasma levels (in% of the standard or I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk is prevalent for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, a proper determination of the factor VIII plasma bar is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half-life times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg of body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor of VIII plasma activities is not reached or if the blood is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to verify an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The dosage speed should be directed according to the patient's condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII directed by IgG immunoglobulins that are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma using modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure stage is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure times and anamnestically known inhibitor development, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (low titbits) inhibitors is observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women, there are no experiences about applying factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs inhibitors were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients) who showed a higher risk of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>

<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients with ongoing clinical study, 5 of 25 (20%) were treated with ADVATE inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients on traces of contaminating proteins was analyzed by investigating the antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibody antibody protein against anti-CHO cell proteins, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms resulting in an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since initial approval, CHMP continued to consider the benefit risk mitigation as positive, but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore the CHMP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which necessitates a submission of PSURs every 6 months, so that the filing owner should apply for another extension within five years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited distributed the Committee for Human Use Medicinal Products (CHMP) that the company rejects its application for the marketing of an Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the chest, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissues that connect other structures in the body, surrounds and supports) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">It is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is an" "" "adenovirus" "", "which has been modified so that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger any infection in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the p53 gene that is not defective in the human body, normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni cancer, with which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient, with the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the area of undermining, bone and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP testified the answers of the company to the questions asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initially submitted documents, the CHMP will generate a list of questions sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin brings benefits to patients in Li-Fraumeni.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also concerns concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not sufficiently proved that Advexin can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not notice the CHMP whether the return has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate-use" programmes with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed active release" "" "means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective ingredients will be released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal rhinitis (hay fever, caused by an allergy to pollen induced inflammation of the nasal pathways) in patients with nasal mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and youngsters aged 12 and over, the recommended dose of aerosol is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are subkled.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the blockage of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in the degree of severity of hay fever symptoms, which were reported by the patients before the treatment begins and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hypocrisy symptoms, except the constipation of the nose, the patients who took aerosze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35.9% in the patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, patients among Aerinaze showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who received Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart failure), mouthlessness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or one of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or Loratadin (another drug for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a lid glaucoma (elevated level of intraocular pressure), heart or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroid gland), or already have a hemorrhagic stroke (caused by brain bleeding) or have a risk of a hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission approved the SP Europe agreement for the marketing of aerinars across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is swallowed whole (i.e. without disbiting, cracking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data for harmlessness and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after finishing the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the use time to 10 days, as long-term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory system, the treatment can be continued with desloratadin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aeronze contains Pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphonetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as Bromocripitin, Pergoeyelid, Ergotamin, Dihydroergotamine or other Dekongestiva, which are used perally or nasal as a swelling rhinology (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymeazoline, naphazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient collective and the data do not suffice to pronounce appropriate recommendations for dosing.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerosins were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suffice to pronounce appropriate recommendations for dosing.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treating hypertension or tachycardia or palmettes, heart rhythm disorders, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of headaches) must be deposited.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patient groups, caution is recommended: • Patients with cardiac arrhythmia • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infant in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck, or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze must be deposited at least 48 hours prior to the implementation of dermatological tests as antihistamines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In clinical trials with Desloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor test, no significant differences could be found between the patients with the Desloratadin and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether Desloratadin alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 drug does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein is.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerinars during pregnancy is not assured, however, experiences from a large number of affected pregnant women did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconical properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinars should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases, there may be a dazzlement that may result in impairment of traffic noise or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms can vary between a CNNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNNS stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible letters.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, frightful disposition, muscle weakness, and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, impediatric pain, dizziness, hypertension, hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A ZNS stimulation is most likely in children as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouthwash, pupillary and dilation, skin redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of release of inflammatory cytokines like IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion smoleküls P-selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance, including the amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of drowsiness was observed in the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause other sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1.248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic effectiveness of aerinaze tablets, determined by the total cores for the symptoms (except nasal mucosa), was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosa, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Ainaze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to gender, age or ethnic affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study for the pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after the application in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">The body weight of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10 after the peroral application of aerinars in healthy subjects over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose case study, which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet on healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects Desloratadin poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of Pseudoephedrine according to the sole gift of pseudoephedrine was bioequivalent to exposure to the gift of an aerar tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin cannot detect any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination possessed no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the substance pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in doses of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">The pharmacovigilance system described in March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in eight studies with about 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness has been measured by investigating the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrans, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six-week treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were presented to demonstrate that the body uses the syrup, the solution for intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of acerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the previous disease progression and may terminate after the symptoms of the symptoms and resume their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to the patient during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Desloratadin tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">The patients should, however, be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to dizziness which may result in impairment of traffic noise or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in different indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects were reported in patients with Aerius, than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were tiredness (1.2%), mouth dryness (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 adolescent patients aged 12 to 17, the most common side effect was headache, this occurred at 5.9% of patients treated with Desloratadin and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, where up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nineteen clinical dose) were administered, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of release of inflammatory cytokines like IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>

<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic Urticaria was investigated for further forms of the Urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, regardless of the etiology, is similar to the different forms, and chronic patients can be easily recruited prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As histamine release is a causal factor in all urinary disorders, it is expected that Desloratadin also results in other forms of the urticaria to improve the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic Idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>

<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 drug is inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose case study with Desloratadin in a dosage of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, low-calorie breakfast) did not affect the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic Urticaria and the profile of Desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of Desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">As part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in the desloratadin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in the desloratadin in a dose of 45 mg. a day (the nine-fold of the clinical dose) was applied for over ten days in adults, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials the recommended dosage of 5 mg. a day for adults and adolescents did not determine increased incidence of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1889">Regarding the duration of your treatment your doctor will determine the type of allergic rhinitis between which you suffer and will determine how long you should take Aerius's solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="1890">However, in children under 2 years of diarrhea, fever and sleeplessness, frequent side-effects were reported in adults fatigue, mouth dryness and headaches more often than with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1891">97 Aerius solution for acceptance is available in bottles with a child-safe seal with 30, 50, 60, 100, 120, 150, 225 and 300 ml.</seg>

<seg id="1893">Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. announces the Committee for Human Use Medicinal Products (CHMP) officially that the company takes its application for the marketing of Aflunov on the prevention of aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears that can easily spread from humans to humans, because humans have not yet built immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "after administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus as" "" "body alien" "" "in the vaccine and forms antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is later able to form faster antibodies in a contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface which the human body recognizes as a body-alien) was disconnected, cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like further information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also included in the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus from type 1 (HIV-1) that causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, asgenerase is available as a solution to intake, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir since the safety of this combination was not studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Generic drugs should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked the antiviral drugs used by the patient before and the likelihood of the virus to respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which together with twice daily 100 mg Ritonavir and other antiviral drugs are taken.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of asms is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other anti-viral medicines, asgenerase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS does not cure, but can delay the immune system damage and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Asgenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug asgenerase with low dosed Ritonavir was compared with 206 adults who used earlier protease inhibitors, compared to other protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non-detectable concentrations of HIV in the blood (virus load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who previously had no protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks, more patients had a virus load below 400 copies / ml than under placebo, but Agenase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenase also reduced viral load, but with the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, very few addressed the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the last-week treatment with Ritonavir increased the viral load after 16-week treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase came together with Ritonavir a higher viral load after four weeks as with the patients who continued their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of asgenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), nausea (nausea), nausea, rash, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Asgenerasis may not be used in patients, the St. John's Wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines that are detrimental to the same as asgenerase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take asgenera are the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body fat), a osteonous rose (die extinction of bone tissue) or an immune response syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Human Use Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of asgenerase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Asgenerase is usually taken along with the pharmacokinetic amplifiers Ritonavir, but the committee found that the benefits of asgenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously had not taken any protease inhibitors has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "asgenerase was originally approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "" "" "October 2000 the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited a permit for the marketing of asylum in the entire European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">Asgenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -pre-treated adults and children over 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually asgenera capsules should be administered to pharmacokinetic boostery of Amprenavir together with low doses of ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral disease pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from Amprenavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solutions are not exchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for ase-ase capsules is 600 mg Amuravir twice daily along with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenase capsules are applied without the increased addition of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of ash (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for ase-ase capsules is 20 mg of Amuravir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily highest dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors have not been studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Asgenerasis is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the lack of data for harmlessness and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application is to be performed with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Asgenerase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of Amprenavir while taking Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that asgenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for the HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with vase, does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Generally, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal healthiness.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with previously restricted liver function including chronic-active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenase and Ritonavir with Fluticasone or other glucocosteroids, which are metabolised via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment predominates the risk of systemic corticostereroides, including Morbus Cushing and suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin strongly depends on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of vastatin with lovastatin and simvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of myopathies, including rhabdomyolysen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Ordinance Ratio), methods are available to determine the active substance concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who are taking these drugs at the same time, Agenase may be less effective due to the reduction of Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given simultaneously with Amuravir, patients should therefore be monitored on opiatry symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerase solution, this dosage form is contraindicated in children under a age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Ash should be reduced to 5 when a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an existing diabetes mellitus was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy medicines which are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-related factors, such as a longer ongoing antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders, associated.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Hemophiles patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors are reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis.</seg>
<seg id="1957">At the time of initiation of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), HIV-infected patients can develop an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial etiology is assumed (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrose were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width are not allowed at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir may not be combined with drugs whose active substances are mainly metabolised by CYP2D6 and are linked to increased plasma levels with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction of the AUC of Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In trying to compensate the reduced plasma levels by means of a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum mirrors of Amprenavir can be humiliated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with Johanniskraut (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already uses Johanniskraut, the prenatal surface and, if possible, to check the viral load and remove the St. John's Wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary when nelfinavir is administered together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for Cmax, however, reduced by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg of Amprenavir were used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which demonstrate the efficacy and harmlessness of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% dehumbles when Amuravir (750 mg twice daily) administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lecture avir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma that were achieved with Kaletra (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lecture avir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, a close-meshed monitoring is recommended since the effectiveness and harmlessness of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study used to apply asgenerase in combination with Didanosine, but due to the antacid component of Didanosine it is recommended that the income of didanosine and asgenerase are at least one hour apart (see antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in the case of emphavirence in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended since the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapine on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advisable because Delavirdine could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasmaspes.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these drugs are used together, caution is advised; a thorough prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir on delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193% and thus an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with asgenerase, it will be recommended to reduce the dosage of rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with vase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however, the plasminated levels of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg Ritonavir with 200 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of Cmax of ketoconazole in the plasma at 2.69fold compared to the value which was observed after 200 mg of ketoconazole once daily without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines which are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, can lead to interdependencies.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with asms.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors it is advisable that antacids do not be taken at the same time as asgenerase, as it can cause resorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulants known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with Amprenavir can lead to a humiliation of Amprenavir plasma tiles.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Nifedipine, nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased 10 by Amprenavir, thus increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous ingestion with ase can considerably increase their plasma concentration and increase with PDE5 inhibitors associated with side-effects including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial, in which ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg of Fluticasonpropionat intranasal (4 times a day) more than 7 days at subjects increased, while the endogenous cortisol declined by about 86% (90% rate interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous administration of asgenera with Ritonavir along with these glucocosteroids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment predominates the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases of plasma levels can be expected during concurrent administration.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma-level increases of these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to Myopathy including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of these drugs with Amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">A more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations up to the stabilisation of the mirrors is recommended, as the plasma concentration of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased simultaneously (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, asgenerase may not be applied together with the Midazolam (see Section 4.3), while with the simultaneous use of asgenera with parenteral midazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible rise in the plasma levels of Midazolam around 3-4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is administered together with Amuravir, patients should therefore be monitored on opiatry symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation to adjust the current dose when Amprenavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In simultaneous dispensing of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with asgenerase, increased control of INR (International Ordination Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of a weakening or intensification of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional dosage of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods of contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended at concurrent dosage of asgenera (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be applied after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk lending rats were demonstrated amprenavir-related substances, however, it is not known whether amprenavir is transferred to the mother's milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study of pregnant rats, which was administered from the ingestion to the uterus through to the end of the breast feeding period, showed a diminished increase in 12 body weight during the downtime.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the offspring, including Fertilisation and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of Amprenavir to the mother-animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Atrium harmlessness was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the ase-ase treatment were mild to moderate, and occurred early and often led to a breakthrough therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events are not clarified whether they are related to the intake of asgenera or another at the same time to HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the aforementioned side effects stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which protease inhibitors did not receive 1200 mg of asgenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), evaluated by the investigators as related to study mediation and performed in more than 1% of patients, as well as laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) are performed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and uterine fat tissue, more intra-abdominal and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation (Stiernack).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral not pre-treated individuals treated with amprenavir in combination with Lamivudine / Zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (Stiernack) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, there were 7 cases (3%) in case of 245 NRTIs (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) compared to 27 cases (11%), in combination with various NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually slightly embossed, erythematous or impeculopapulous nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment had to be aborted with imprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteoneksis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">At the time of initiation of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), HIV-infected patients can develop an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg of ase twice daily along with low dosed ritonavir (grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable; an exception formed increases of triglyceride and CPK values, which were received in patients who received asgenerase along with low dosed Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is to observe signs of intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supportive action.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thus prevents the processing of viral gene and gag polyewear levels with the consequence of an education unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymphoblast cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmconcentration (IC50) of Amprenavir lies in the range from 0.012 to 0.08 µM with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM for chronically infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The link between the activity of Amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral not pre-treated patients with currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other ritonavir-drilled treatment schemes with protease inhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen of 434 antiretroviral not pre-treated patients who received 700mg Fosamprenavir with 100mg ritonavir twice a day in the study ESS100732, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates could be examined genotypically.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of 13 of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients with protease inhibitors did not appear before treated patients showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, M46I / L, I47V, I54L / M / T / V, Q58E, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the study APV30003 and their extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) to patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibiting mutations occurred:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypical resistance testing, genotypical interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / V, L33F, M36I, I54A / L / F / G, I84V and L90M in combination with increased phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir and a reduced probability of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for analyzing the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypical resistance testing, clinically validated phenotypical interpretations can be used in conjunction with the genotypic data to evaluate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic Cut-offs (crossover points) for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic patterns associated with reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic samples creates a certain cross-resistance to Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross-resistance between Amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral not pre-treated patients, with whom a Fosamprenavir (three of 25 isolates), Darimavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and tipranavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>

<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to asgenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI have been included in part A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis presented the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir in comparison with the time-adjusted mean change from baseline (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-loss threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbiased asgenerase is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children between the ages of 2 and 18, of which 152 with PI were treated.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerative solution for intake and capsules was examined three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosed ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of NRTIs together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, about 25% of patients included in the study showed a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in CD4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the baseline value.</seg>

<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed onto a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of the blood circulation into the tissue.</seg>

<seg id="2184">An interruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur (see section 4.4) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area.</seg>
<seg id="2185">If the follow-up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period, the treated lesions are only completely healed, another therapy should be started (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2186">When a dose was omitted, the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Imiquimod-cream can be applied in a thin layer and rub in the purified, with tilt infected skin area until the cream is completely retracted.</seg>

<seg id="2190">In other studies, in which no daily pre-authygiene was performed, two cases of severe phimosis and one case were observed with a tendency leading to circumcision.</seg>
<seg id="2191">With an application of Imiquimod cream in higher than the recommended doses, there is increased risk of severe local skin irritation (see section 4.2.) In rare cases, severe local skin irritations were also observed, which made a treatment necessary and / or caused by temporary physical impairment.</seg>
<seg id="2192">In cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the urethra, some women had difficulty passing urine which required an emergency catheterisation and treatment of the affected area.</seg>
<seg id="2193">For the application of imiquimod-cream immediately following a treatment with other cutaneous resins in the genital and peripheral region, no clinical experience has previously existed.</seg>

<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the severity of local skin reactions, a treatment break can be made of several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after regenerating the treated skin for about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Since there are currently no data on long term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment, other suitable therapy forms should be taken into consideration in superfide cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">In patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs there are no clinical experiences, so the application is not recommended in previously untreated patients.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study indicates that in large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2) there is a reduced likelihood of response to Imiquimod therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not studied for the treatment of actinent keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip boat.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinent keratoses in anatomical places outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinish keratosis on forearms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application, so such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions usually decrease in intensity during therapy or go back after the treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong, treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">From the data of an open clinical trial, patients with more than 8 Ak- lesions showed a lower complete treatment rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immuno-stimulating properties, Imiquimod cream should be used with caution in patients receiving an immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2215">The side effects indicated by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of phase III with Imiquimod cream treated patients with actinent keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">According to the test plan, the clinical evidence assessed in this placebo-controlled clinical trials often resulted in local skin reactions including Erythema (61%), erosion (30%), erosion (30%), excretion / scams (23%) and oil (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">According to the test plan, the assessment of the clinical evidence shows that in these studies, five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream is very common to severe erythema (31%), heavy erosions (13%), and severe scarring and rusting (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials to investigate the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of the actin keratosis, Alopecia was observed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental unique oral absorption of 200 mg imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The most clinically serious side-effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, existed in hypotonia which normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation, increasing systemic concentrations of the alpha interferons and other cytokines have been proven following the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies showed that efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the cowarts in an Imiquimod treatment is clearly superior over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of the patients with Imiquimod who were treated with Imiquimod, patients were treated completely; this was 20% of the patients with placebo treated patients in the case (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 with Imiquimod treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod in five-time use per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed individual primary superficent basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and this also remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic ac- lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 treatment area on the unhairy scalp or in the face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical cooling after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The supposed indications of external cowarts, actin keratitis and superfidal basal cell carcinoma do not usually occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was examined in four randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies at the doses examined there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively) respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic absorption of the 5% Imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute keratosis was observed during the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and betrugen 0.1, 0.2 and 1,6 ng / ml when using in the face (12,5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated half-life time was about 10times higher than the 2-hour half-value after the subcutaneous use in a previous study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod after topical application to MC-diseased skin of patients aged 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with acute keratosis or superficent basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity in the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased militia weight; a study conducted for the dermal application for four months showed no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice by maladministration in three days a week did not induce tumours at the application point.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption of the human skin and is not mutagenic, there is a risk for humans to look very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side-effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, specifically these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of aldurazyms should only be performed in an appropriate clinical environment in which revitalization facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, almost all patients form IgG antibodies to Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction have to be treated with caution when using aldurazyms (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="2304">Adverse reactions in clinical trials were prescribed mainly as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in Phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are shown in the following table following the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, respiration and facial oil (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2309">In most patients it occurred within 3 months after the start of the treatment for a seroidal version, whereby the patients aged less than 5 years with a more severe form of trial were reported (average after 26 days compared to 45 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the phase 3 study (or up to a premature ejection from the study), there were no antibodies found in 13 / 45 patients, not by radioimmuno-cipitation (RIP) assay, among them 3 patients with whom it never came to serogue version.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the GAG mirror in the urine, while in patients with high antibody titers, a variable reduction of GAG was determined in the harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in Phase 3 study and one in Phase 2 study) showed a marginally to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronification activity in vitro, which did not affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the appearance of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The rationale for the enzyme therapy is one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate restoration of the enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from circulation and is absorbed by cells into the lymphoomes, most likely over Mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms were studied in a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study that showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were from the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the serious phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg of Aldurazyms for a further 3,5 years (182 weeks) each week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and ability to be shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as emerges from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage FEV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased further proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) until the end of the study was normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease in the GAG mirror was found in the urine (µg / mg Kreatinin), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">With regard to the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined end point, clinically significant changes spanning five activity variable (expected percentage of normal FEV, distance in the 6-minute test, movement area of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open Phase 2 study was conducted, in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were studied in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old (16 patients with severe form and 4 with the middle course of the trial).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients, the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to elevated Gag- mirror in the urine in week 22.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another drug against cancer) in patients who have no chemotherapy (medicines for cancer), and malignant (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) or may be easily spread to other parts of the body. • more advanced or metastatic "non-small" lung cancer, which does not attack the squamous cell epithelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used in patients who have previously not been treated, combined with cisplatin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapy regimens compared to some therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should receive a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">When Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, before or after the gift of cisplatin, should additionally be given an anti-emetikum (medicines for vomiting) and fluids (to prevent a lack of fluid).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood image changes or when certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, removed or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetremixed slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to divide.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetyxed into its active form is easier to equip in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active time in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleuramesothelioms, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared with a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, compared to the effects of docetaxel (other medicines for cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in which the cancer did not attack the squamous cell epithelial cells during the administration of Alimta was longer survival than with the comparative medication.</seg>

<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small bronchalcarcinoma following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Reduction of the frequency and severity of skin reactions must be given on the day before and on the day of the pemetry gift as well as on the day after the treatment a corticosteroid.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of pemetry, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment regimen as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg.) in week before the first Pemetremixed dosage, as well as after every third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving pemetry, a full blood image should be created before each offering, including a differentiation of leukocytes and a thrombocyte counting.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate-transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanin-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should amount to ≤ 3 times of the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose-examination must take place under the reaffirmation of the Nadirs of the blood-picture or the maximum hematological toxicity of the preceding therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients not develop hematological toxicity ≥ degree 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient receives the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if in patients after 2 doses reduction or hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so- fort in degree 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical trials have no indication that at the age of 65 years or above, there is an increased side-efficiency risk in patients aged 65 years or above.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, patients with a creatinin clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary to go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data position in patients with a creatinin clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper biliruby bordervalue and / or transaminases of &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (in the case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5,0-ples of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically examined in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to bone marginuppression and may not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophils count again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombosis count again a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophils, thrombocyte numbers and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as observed in previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 hematological and non-matological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 Neutropenia became beo- billed if a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore all patients who are treated with Pemetry must be dependent on folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic action to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid concurrent intake of nonsteroidal anti-phlogistika (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and mindes- tens 2 days after the therapy with Pemetyxed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients, for whom a therapy with Pemetremixed, must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-value for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetyxed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients with whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant liquid accumulation in transcellular space, a drainage of the cross before the Pemetremixed treatment should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular incidents, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials with Pemetremixed occasionally when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated vital substances (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible damage is due to the reproductive capacity by Pemetremixed, men should be advised of the treatment program, consult with regard to the sperm cell activation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 1.3 g per day) lead to a reduced phase of refractory effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is therefore advised if in patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid are used in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and mindes- tens 2 days after the therapy with Pemetyxed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data regarding the interaction potential associated with NSAIDs with long half-value such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with Pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of tanning status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplasty chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of INR (International Ordination Ratio) if the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetry in pregnant women, but as with ande- ren antimetabolites, severe labour defects are expected in pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich individual meal or low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes is accompanied by improved metabolic monitoring, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli because the dosage of the antidiabetic must be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for hypertension or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these medicines must be adapted.</seg>

<seg id="2521">In a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and ciclosporin, a reduction of Ciclosporin plasma tiles was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">When using warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (internationally standardized ratio, INR) could be influenced (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated with orlistat up to 4 full years in clinical trials, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as the beta-carotene remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, the patient should be advised to take an additional multivitamin preparation before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect negative effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are associated with the pharmacological impact of the drug, as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side-effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency on the basis of available data not invaluable).</seg>

<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the market launch reported by Orlistat overdosage, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as in the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a rapid repayment of possible systemic effects, which are attributable to the limping properties of orlistat, can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect sets in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine through covalent bond to the active serin-rest of gastric and pancreatic lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day, blocked the absorption of approximately 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg of orlistat which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalic, fetish-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was assessed as follows: as a change in body weight during the course of study (Table 1) and as a percentage of those who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months, the greatest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the overall cholesterin was with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (baseline 5.20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was with orlistat 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (baseline 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (baseline value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg of orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, metabolized orlistat in the plasma could be detected only sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without any signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with adipous patients who administered the minimal systemic resorbated dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolyzed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-formyl-leucine-group), could be identified, the approximate 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (like cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies, the excessive triggers for nausea and vomiting (like cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as antiemetikum).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended since the effects in this age group are not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies to 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy regimens which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the regular trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission granted approval to the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approved by Aloxi in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in highly emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer disease and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a highly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a Corticosteroids given before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">As palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with anamnesty fruit-ipation or signs of subacute idiom after injection are closely monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advised for simultaneous dispensing of palonosetron with drugs that extend the QT interval or in patients with whom the Qt interval is extended or that tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to a further chemotherapeutic application, Aloxi is not to be used in the days following chemotherapy, nor for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit tumor activity (Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Cyclophosphamide, Cycloabine, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose palonosetron and a steady-state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population-based pharmacokinetic analysis, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (chlorpromazine, hemoperidol, paroxetine, haloperidol, paroxetine, sertraline and terbinafine) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the application of palonosetron in human pregnancies is not before, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 mcgram to observed side-effects (total 633 patients), which were at least likely associated with aloxi, headache (9%) and fruit ipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the location (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were given in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dose, there were similar frequency of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-action relationships to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There were no dialysis studies carried out due to the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably not effective therapy with an aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderate emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and 250 micrograms or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-weight 7.3 hours) received that was given on day 1 without dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine, as well as 250 or 750 mcgram palonosetron, were compared to patients who received 32 mg Ondansetron, which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate-dose chemotherapy and the study with highly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the Qtc interval, were comparable to the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the ECG effects of administered palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentration a slow elimination of the body with an average terminale half-time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous administration of palonosetron 0.25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean medium (± SD) measured in 11 testicular carcinoma patients ranged from day 1 and day 5 to 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations, an intravenous administration of 0,25 mg Palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) with the value of 0.75 mg measured after a one-time intravenous administration; however, the Cmax was higher after the disposition of 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated over the kidneys, and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on the metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser degree, the Isoenzme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found about 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unmodified active ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Following a unique intravenous stub injection, the total body of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminale elimination of the elimination of the liver and the average systemic exposure with palonosetron increases, however, a reduction of the dose is therefore not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered sufficient beyond the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Preclinical trials suggest that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and can prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose said in approximately the 30-fold of therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumors, endocrine neoplasms (thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal mark) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is intended for one-time application in humans, the relevance of these results is very low.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report, in which the failure of approval for the marketing of the drug for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference medicinal products" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination, the liver tissue damage, besides, the values of the liver enzymes alanin- and aminotransferase (ALT) are elevated in the blood abnormal.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which stimulates it for the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon laid data against the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (compound structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference doctor in 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured how many patients responded to the treatment after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment (i.e. no sign of virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were expressed in detail that the data for the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed does not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C responding to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease progressed again in more patients than with the reference doctor; Alpheon also had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study was not sufficiently validated for the study of the question of how far the drug forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug).</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected infirations (cracking or cutting), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo might not affect this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied to patients from the age of nine months, but patients under 18 years of age may not be more than 2% of the body surface to be treated.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the physician should reexamine the patient and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main Indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was subdued after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together in Hautwunden, about 90% of the patients of both groups responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (whipped hollow spaces in the body tissue) or of infections caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the job.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo were predominant in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small lazations, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission approved the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the importation of altargo in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of sensitization or severe local irritation by using Retapamulin ointment, the treatment is canceled, the ointment meticulously wipes out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected as pathogen (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials at secondary infected wounds the effectiveness of retinamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was inadequate.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after 2-3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of Retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentration used in humans for topical use on shoted skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazole increased the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% Retapamulin ointment on shoted skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients, dose adjustments are not considered necessary if topical retapatulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin ointment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial treatment is clearly indicated and the use of Retapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether the breastfeeding continues / terminated or the therapy should be continued with Altargo, it is possible to weigh between the benefits of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefits of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which Altargo applied, the most common reported side effect was Irritation at the point of adoption, which was about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic Derivat of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passestoanus (earlier pleurotus passestoanus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The effect mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding place of the bacterial ribosom, which differs from the binding places of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site ribosomales protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P binding agent and the PeptidylTransfer Center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By linking to this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibit the peptide transfer, sometimes block P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50S ribosomal sub-units.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of Retapamulin at least some infection forms should be questionable should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences were found in the In-vitro activity of Retapamulin opposite S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to treatment at S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin ointment was applied daily under occlusion to intact and on shielded skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin ointment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary, traumatic wounds, individual plasmin robes were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling procedure was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before mediation and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake of the people after topical use of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 snug skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, lower involvement of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were performed over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro verification on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rats microkernel test for in-vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which was achieved by up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 snug skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats were observed in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3-fold of the estimated human exposure (see above)), development stoicity (reduced body weight of the foetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of the permit for placing on the market must ensure that a pharmacovigilisation system, as presented in the module 1.8.1 of the application (version 6,2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is being applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of the permit for the placing on the market undertakes to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilisation activities in the Pharmakovigillic plan, as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and described in the 1.8.2 of the filing application, as well as any additional updates of the RMP agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Medicinal products for human use," the updated RMP will be submitted simultaneously with the next periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated place show, you should terminate the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it was not specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It may not be used in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">When the ointment is on one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile bandage or a Gazette, unless your doctor has advised you to uncover the area.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic closure that contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminium bag containing 0,5 g ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix must only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and ensures that the vaccination plan existing from two doses can be brought to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a dose of hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or another hepatitis C or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by attaching the immune system (the natural defence of the body), "as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccine Twinrix adults approved since 1996 and the vaccine Twinrix for children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan existing from three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults have also been used as evidence of the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix performed between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambirix was similar to a six-month interval between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, appetite deficiency, pain at the injection point, redness, consistency (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix must not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other constituents or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for the placing of the Ambirix in the complete</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardisation plan for the primitization with the Ambirix consists of two doses of vaccination, whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose ranges between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a vaccination is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with appropriate monovalent vaccines or combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-hepatitis C) antibody values observed in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent individuals who have addressed a Hepatitis A- vaccination as protection require a refresher vaccination as they may also be protected by immunological memory in no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injections vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the Standardimpfescheme is recommended with the combination simplex, which contains 360 ELISA units of formalininated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hemodialysis patients and persons with immune system disorders, there is no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs-antibody value after the first dimming, so that in these cases the gift of further vaccination doses may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intraoral injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal impetus, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix can be injected subcutaneous as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix is administered in the second year of life with a combined dipheric, tetanus-, acellular pertus-, inactivated poliomyelitis and haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or combined with a combined masern- mumps-roval vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients suffering from immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immundefects it has to be assumed that there is possibly no sufficient immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, mating, gastroenteritis, headache and fever was comparable to the incidence observed in earlier thiomerically and preservative vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccination doses of the Ambirix were administered to a total of 1027 vaccinations between 1 and 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-dose combination simplistic comparison.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and activity based on a calculation basis per vaccine Ambirix, but not on a basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix at 50,7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% in the subjects after the gift of a dose of the 3-dose combination simplex.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66,4% of the subjects that Ambirix had received, about pain, compared to 63.8% among the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of dexterity was comparable high per pro-tape (i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received the Ambirix, compared to 36.2% among the subjects who received the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and dexterity was small and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination of combination with the 3-doses-vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year vaccination, the appearance of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dose combination simplex with 360 ELISA units of formalininated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinated hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">At the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a more common occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccination that reported severe side effects during the 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination of 360 ELISA- units of formalininated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinated hepatitis B's surface antigen was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted in vaccination at the age of 1 to 15 years, seroconversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose, for month 6 administrated dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The seroconversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose, for month 6 administrated dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard Combination Simple with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was evaluated, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3-dose impletion compared to Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which was reached in a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11-year-olds one month after the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccinations received either a 2 doses-vaccination scheme with the Ambirix or a 3-doses-vaccination scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA-units of formalininated hepatitis A virus and 10µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For persons who were aged between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs was detected over at least 24 months after immunization with the Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study was comparable to those found after vaccination of 3 cans with a combination simplex, consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalinated hepatitis- A-virus and 10 µg of recombinated hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study in 12- to including 15-year-olds, demonstrated that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies can be compared 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 month vaccine is compared to that in the 0-12 months vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life coincides with the refreshment of a combined dipheric, tetanus-, azellular pertus-, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine efficacy (DTPA-IPV / HIB), or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps-rocket vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical trial conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar Seroprotection and Seroconversion rates similar to earlier formulations.</seg>

<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are already infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vaccination doses (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the vaccine point), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections, which damage the liver or cause symptoms, which are similar to those after hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection, cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child already has shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any component of this vaccine including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be expressed by itching skin rashes, respiratory or swelling of the face or tongue. • If your child has already had an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever / has.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usual dose of the second vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a potential risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead he will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis C / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective constituents per vaccine (360 ELISA units of a formalinactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccine of this vaccine with reduced content of active ingredients is usually administered a month after the first dose and should give you a vaccine protection against termination of the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is suffering from people suffering from severe blood clotting disorders, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your body's body, or if you / your child undergo a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination cannot be sufficient so a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Send your doctor if you / your child take other medicines (including those who have been vaccinated) or if you / your child have been vaccinated recently or have received immunoglobulins (antibodies) or has been planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If a different vaccine must be given simultaneously with the Ambirix, it should be vaccinated at separate places and as different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Typically, Ambirix is not administered pregnant or breastfeeding women unless it is urgently required that they are vaccinated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>

<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data that has been known since the issuance of the first permit for the placing of the market, CHMP expressed the opinion that the benefit-risk ratio for the Ambirix stays positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix has been in circulation only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete endoid defect or with hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage as a result of high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is - split into several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed with food or administered via a gastrostomieschlauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach's leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose in the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because ammonia could not be compared with another treatment or with placebo (a placebo, i.e. without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonia can also cause loss of appetite, a abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, impotence, fluid retention, pains, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, unpleasant odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Human Use Medicinal Products (CHMP) concludes that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle is effectively prevented from excessive ammonia values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "ammonia was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "because due to the rare condition of the disease, only limited information about this medicine was available." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifested form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first month of life), there is an indication of the use when in the anamnesis a hyperammonite encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with loopholes, AMNAX is also available in granulate form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Daily dose is calculated according to the protein intolerance and the daily protein intake required for the growth and development of the patient's daily protein intake.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The previous clinical experience is the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg, as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early manificient lack of carbamyl phosphate synthetic or ornithinate bamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinate deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMEX tablets may not be administered with swallowing disturbances because there is a risk for the formation of oesophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMEX contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponds to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMNAX should therefore only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium and odemagulation associated clinical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since the metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat is over the liver and kidneys, AMNAX should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMEX during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In a subcutaneous gift of phenylacetate to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), it resulted in a slowing of neuronal reproduction and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There also found a delayed irritation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted by humans into the breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMEX is contraindicated during lactation (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least an unwanted event (AE) and 78% of those undesirable events were assumed that they were not connected with AMEX.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMRO (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old Angoretic patient, which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactatactin, severe hypokalemia, panzytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred during a 5 month old toddler with a single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous dosages of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound, conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted via kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Butchiometrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine with urea compared (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram the sodium phenylbutyrate is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylluglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of early manifests with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infectious, and the disease even led to death even in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analoga within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By means of hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative ways of nitrous oxide (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn at postpartal (however within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonite encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it was time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifested form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygote form of the Orniintranscarbamylase deficiency), which recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and afterwards treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidneys with glutamine, whereby phenylacetylglutamine arises.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine have been determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutylate in sober-healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form, 15 minutes after ingesting the plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cyclic acid or hemoglobin opathies, phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in the next morning after night fasting no phenylacetate in the plasma can be detectable.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis of liver cirrhosis, which were repeated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma tiles on the third day were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product Phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">After the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrate had no clastoic effects with toxic and non-toxic doses (investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMEX granulate is taken either orally (infants and children who cannot swallow tablets, or patients with swallowing disturbances) or via a gastrostomieschlauch or a nasal onde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">The previous clinical experience is the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg, as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early manificient lack of carbamyl phosphate synthetic or ornithinate bamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMNAX granules contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rat flutes were subjected to phenylacetate (active metabolite from phenylbutyrat) before birth, it came to lesions in the pyramid cells of the cerebral cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMRO (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old Angoretic patient, which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactatactin, severe hypokalemia, panzytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Butchiometrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine with urea comparable (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that for each gram the sodium phenylbutyrate is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrat in granulatform, 15 minutes after the ingestion of measured plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life, the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure the small measuring spoon 0,95 g, the medium measuring spoon 2,9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication via a probe, AMEX may also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen containing waste products, which accumulate after eating proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you are looking for laboratory studies, you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AMEX, as sodium phenylbutyrate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you take AMRO with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the breastfeeding period, you may not take AMMONAPS as the medicine may pass into the mother's milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headache, taste disturbances, disappointment of hearing, disorientation, memory disturbances and a deterioration of existing neurological states were observed.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in instable Angina (a form of pain in the chest with different thicknesses) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "ST- Lift" (an anomal measurement value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angiox was compared with a single gift or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) compared to conventional combination therapy with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients often used a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent closure), and they additionally received other medicines for preventing blood clots, such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">The treatment of ACS was angiox - with or without a gift of GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or Revascularisation) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who undergo a PCI, Angiox was as effective as Heparin regarding all indicators, except for severe bleeding in which it was much more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Bivalerudine, other shudine or other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as with people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission approved the Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve the marketing authorisation of Angiox in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (instabile Angina / non-ST lifting infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is envisaged.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous stuffing of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0,25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If one PCI is performed in another episode, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and infusion increases for the duration of the surgery to 1,75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0,25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a caption of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered, followed by an infusion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolus release of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an allsome bolus administration of angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value is shortened to less than 225 seconds (ACT after 5 minutes), a second bolt release should be 0.3 mg / kg / body weight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and the dose is administered intravenously intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with severe kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with Bivalerudine against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt dosage of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with severe kidney damage, included in the III- PCI-study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the Bivalerudine-Bolus dosage without Dosisizance on average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when Bivalerudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if PCI-patients suffer from bivalent arterial points in most arterial points, patients with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may occur during the treatment principle everywhere bleeding occur.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving Warfarin and treated with Bivalerudine, a monitoring of the INR valuation (International Ordinance Ratio) should be taken into consideration to ensure that the value after setting the treatment with Bivalerudine is again achieved prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytic or Thrombocytes aggregates), this drug may increase the risk of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of Bivalerudine with thrombocytes aggregates or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are regularly checked regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental studies are inadequate regarding the effects of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, development or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivaliudine alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivaliudine plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractive Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">In both the Bivalerudine group as well as in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, patients were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients over 65 years.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleedings were defined according to ACUITY and Timi scales for severe bleeding as defined in table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding performed significantly less often than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and Bivalidendin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point zone, which required a radiological or surgical intervention, hematoma with diameter ≥ 4 g / dl with known blood-point, reduction of hemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood-point, reoperation due to a bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">More, less frequently observed blood localizations, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects are based on the data from a clinical study with Bivalerudine in 6000 patients who undergo a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">In both the Bivalerudine group as well as in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, patients were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients over 65 years.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleedings were significantly less common than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects not listed above have been reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped in table 6 following system organic classes.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose, the treatment with Bivalerudine is immediately canceled and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalerudine, a direct and specific Thrombininhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic center and on the zone of the thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or at the tanning angle.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalerudine on Thrombin, and with it its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin, on the one hand folds the binding of Bivalerudine-ARG3-Pro4 slowly, thereby regenerating the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, through Bivalerudine with serum of patients with whom it had come to heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced Thrombose Syndrome (HIT / HITTS), no thrombocytes was inducing.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients Bivaliudine shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect demonstrated by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If one PCI was performed in the following cases, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg of Bivalerudine was given and infusion increases for the duration of the surgery to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study unfractive Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with instable Angina / non-ST lift attack (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>

<seg id="2939">Clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on application of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalerudine were evaluated in patients who undergo a percutaneous Coronary intervention (PCI) and in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalerudine as peptide, as peptide, passes through a catabolism into its amino acid constituents with subsequent reuse of the amino acids in the body-pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolit, resulting from the split of the ARG3-Pro4-binding of the N-terminale sequence through Thrombin, is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thrombin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm injected or administered as continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or which insulin does not work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin Lulisin is very slightly different from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter active time than a short-acting humaninulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where the body insulin is not processed effectively, Apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the concentration of substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7,60% to 7,46%) was determined in comparison to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin-lispro.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering the HbA1c concentration was 0,46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin or other components, or in patients suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission approved Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH to grant asylum from Apidra in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta, or subcutaneous through continuous infusion into the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced gluconeogenesis capacity and reduced insulin change, insulin demand in patients can be reduced with a restriction of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any changes in the volume, the brand (manufacturer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of manufacturing can undergo a change in insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or breakage of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change in the dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of a hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change during conversion of the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Substances which can increase blood sugar concentration and increase the inclination to hypoglycemias are oral antidiabetics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, dioxetine, fluoxetine, fluoxetine, fluoxetine, propoxyphen, salizylates and sulfonamid antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathic agents such as beta blockers, Clonidine, Guanethidine and Reservation the symptoms of adrenergic counter regulation can be weakened or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisine and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin sensitivity occurs in human breast milk, but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk, nor is it resorbed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are listed from clinical trials known to system organs and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on availability cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual creation or weakness, confusion, concentration disorders, dizziness, excessive dogs, changes of vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Will fail to change the injection place continuously within the injection range, a lipodystrophy can occur in the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Heavy hypoglycemias involving unconsciousness can be treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by an appropriately trained person, or treated with intravenous offering of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption (especially by skeletal muscle and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous Ga- be of insulin sensitivity occurs faster and the active time is shorter than with hu- manic normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin sensitivity in the therapeutic metering range from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glucose level, and at 0.3 e / kg or more a proportionate increase in the glucose level effect, just like humaninulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin Lulisin has twice as fast as normal human insulin and achieves the total glucose level of about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that a comparable postpranic glycemic control in an application of insulin sensitivity is reached in 2 minutes before the meal, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Became insulin-lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a better postpranic control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Insulin Lulisin is applied 15 minutes after the meal begins, a comparable glycemic check is reached as in normal normal insulin, which is given 2 mixes before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin sensitivity at gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin sensitivity at present 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after) after the start of the meal compared to human nor- malinulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
