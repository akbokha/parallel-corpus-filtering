the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available .
for more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose settings to set up settings .... Open the card tab tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard setup modules from the package k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that any more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras cr@@ ashes . then you can view the page , which has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of cr@@ ashes if any .
the module connection filter ( also called Fol@@ der Fil@@ ters ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address Filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; you can filter the current working directory in different ways .
to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : the document@@ element , all other k@@ not are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
each object is represented by a rec@@ t@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
in &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily detected even if it is far down in the folder hier@@ archy . therefore &amp; FS@@ View can be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the tre@@ mor representation a rec@@ t@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles feature meaningful shade and labelling settings .
the color of a rec@@ t@@ angle that is switched over view color mode can be either depth for the easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the illustration of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rec@@ t@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the various properties of the respective file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if sufficient space to display is present or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles is to be used ( and thus represent@@ ations caused by restrictions on the character of the tre@@ ble ) . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rec@@ t@@ angle .
at display algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed , that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . it is not always observed at the tre@@ mor in &amp; FS@@ View ; frames are drawn to avoid the ne@@ sting of the entries . note that less space for the frame is lost if the rec@@ t@@ angle is square .
how to partition the surface of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . hereby it is possible to divide the areas in such a way that rec@@ tan@@ gles develop , which are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive second release .
you can define the minim@@ ally presented area for an entry through the menu entry view on surface . instead , a room pattern is drawn into the surface of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get , which was developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ e@@ gr@@ ind .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and your photos directly in &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; -@@ albums can be downloaded . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any media and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; together .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; includes fast image editing with basic image processing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides do@@ zens of professional capabilities . it operates completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG @-@ export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with considerably more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or lens , which can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . they should therefore report problems and improvements .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easily as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already entered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam , then we would like to answer you questions to other users of &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; in this mailing list , however English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the di@@ gi@@ kam site to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to get involved is the registration in the developer mailing list . guidance for logging in the developer mailing list of &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; .
when you exit &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data storage is saved . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want to add . &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; will also use as a Al@@ ben@@ library . settings di@@ gi@@ va set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the images , as base folders . &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; regards each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; dur@@ st recur@@ sively the library path throughout its depth . you cannot excl@@ ude sub @-@ folders unless it is in hidden folders . this allows you to add extr@@ avag@@ ant &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; by placing one point in front of the sub@@ folder &apos;s name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and using this on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can enter &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; you can set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My albums and my key@@ word list to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , then &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; possibly also deal with it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help Des@@ k Help menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in sections Ro@@ h decoder settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and your photos directly in &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; -@@ albums can be downloaded . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any media and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera will then be used as a disk drive . the connection can also be realised via Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; uses the g@@ Photos@@ 2 program to communicate with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras , which has an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transm@@ issions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photos@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to read the thumb@@ nails from di@@ gi@@ val . Ex@@ if support is needed by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera drivers to read the thumb@@ nails . if the Ex@@ if support is not in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may possibly need to see thumb@@ nails or the creation might be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manip@@ ulate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; di@@ gi@@ stered ; by writing a small module to add a function than the changes in &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; themselves perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or Ctr@@ l + Shift + F .
drawing and dro@@ pping images works everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ build , over the horizontal divi@@ ding line or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in terms of keywords , date list or search .
- a file selection allows you to extract the most common ones : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . so the fil@@ en@@ ame works only if this is a symbol view . which fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog box settings dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos , which were written by &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam , are stored in a single night@@ mare . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date on which the album was first created , sorted . the date can be changed to the properties of the album .
if you have a scanner set up , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select Album impor@@ ter pictures . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select Album impor@@ ter screen@@ shot .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then pop @-@ up menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move it to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features to give you information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select album Properties in the context menu .
Alb@@ um@@ - Colle@@ ctions : are a method to mark your albums , so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos if you want to add or delete new collections . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the collections for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view Albums Accor@@ ding to date .
the kno@@ bs el@@ dest , average , new ester : these set the date on that of the oldest , the most recent image or that of the average of the album . to do this , first attempt to comp@@ ute the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of last modification of each file is used in this folder .
when you first open an album in &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; Meine Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; sometimes the first picture in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click on the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; Select . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be recycled .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the My key@@ word list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all the images in this album will appear in the image window . each photo will be shown in a preview , you can customize the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fier balls in the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait briefly while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this can be avoided in which you can use all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information about each image will be shown below the thumb@@ nails . what information these are , you can change settings . choose here the albums Page and customize the area preview images to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . the help displays the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such a help window .
pictures and keywords allow you to organize your images in a way that suits you . image editing displays your photos and allows you to create a number of improvements to them . you can view all the features that come with &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; you can choose between viewing images , slideshow or editing images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by calling either F@@ 4 Edit ... or the right mouse button menu . in the di@@ gi@@ kam , image editing pane , you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos . with the image editing , you can view your photos and change them .
it may happen that &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub @-@ menu of opening . to do this , and how to adjust it to your needs , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs can come to problems with the metadata that is contained in the picture . some programs do not store this data with when you save the modified image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way to click on the preview and select Dre@@ ws . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , right click on the preview and select F2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam , it will be moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 image del@@ eting or Del If you prefer to delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the view &amp; quot ; My data list quot ; organiz@@ es your photos based on the data . &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; use either the EX@@ IF date or if it is not available , the date of last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown to you .
photos with keywords provided a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are stick@@ ers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . as soon as a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or search .
when a key@@ word is selected , all photos marked with this key@@ word will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . by this , you can log@@ ically organize your keywords . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word queu@@ e ; work together so that you can find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . in addition , the keywords in the loss of database re @-@ imported , once &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; the pictures are noticed .
you can add new keywords by clicking on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word ; or click on an existing key@@ word and then choose a new key@@ word . if you have cli@@ cked a new key@@ word after you have cli@@ cked on an existing key@@ word , this is the key@@ word for this key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and del@@ eting . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a key@@ word by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and place there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be once in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a key@@ word by clicking the right mouse button and edit the key@@ word in the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word ; change .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the right mouse button and select in the context menu As album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to use &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; s functionality with keywords to use , you must first name your photos with keywords . this can be done in two ways : as soon as you have selected the photos , you can click on the corresponding key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word ; drag and drop them there . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu key@@ word .
you can indicate a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be shown as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can give a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made , etc .
once you have signed a photo with keywords , this will appear in the main window when you preview the image .
you can remove a key@@ word by using the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and remove from the keywords menu . the menu displays only the keywords assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent adjustments of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time@@ frame you just have to click on the lower right of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it will then appear in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
next to the search box is a small lamp the green will be when the search hits . if you click here , the filtering is deleted and all the pictures are shown again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp becomes red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the rider on the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you can open this you get a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here as a live search , which always filtering what you entered as search criterion . after you have been stored , it appears filter in the list .
if you are happy with your selection , press the OK button and the search is performed . the results will be used in view My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching , you just have to select the corresponding entry from the View List pane and select an option in its context menu .
if you choose to edit search , the form to enter the search will appear again with the search information previously entered . if you select to edit an advanced search , the dialog will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for the search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete from the context menu .
the Advanced search will provide you with an extended search form with many search options , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank . each option can be added to the search group by operators . each option can be added to this list by search group / search group . each option can be linked to others via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or at least ... can be linked . in addition , you can create searches of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ GHT .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; characterized each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorith@@ m . this allows images to be compared by comparing these signat@@ ures . the smaller the difference between two visual signat@@ ures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar . if you push a picture from somewhere on the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand color sketch : draw a fast sketch and &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; find the matching pictures . also here a sw@@ elling value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive pattern search tool available based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ ature . you can zoom in or out or move it . drag it while you press the left mouse button . press Ctr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all pictures within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . this naturally pre@@ supp@@ oses that your pictures contain ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it will then be added for later use in the list below . it works like a live geo@@ ip .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; provides a lamp in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctr@@ l ; L D@@ em Ligh@@ ting Table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light@@ box and opened its window .
from the thumb@@ nail , you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window and place there . a small arrow tells you which copy in which window pane can be seen . if you can preview thumb@@ nails from the toolbar and perform a zoo or move operations on one of the pictures , then these are also executed on the other picture . you can therefore compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series . if you navigate pairs from the toolbar , then the first two images are automatically loaded into the areas for compar@@ isons . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to display it on the left . this makes it easy to work through a number of similar pictures .
of course , the normal dele@@ tions also work directly from the light@@ box like e.g. F@@ 4 File Ed@@ iting ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you see at the crossed arrows . in order to pi@@ v@@ ot the visible area of the image , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both images will be shown in the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . just use the zoom slider under the images or Ctr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images if you are viewing in the mode Preview .
what is a digital inventory management - apart from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers any part of the process follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , sc@@ ans or stores digital photos performs a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient manner .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect and use photos . we will focus on the process for digital photographers the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; here we focus on the procedure for digital photographers the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; here we focus on downloading , ren@@ aming , converting , converting , group@@ ing , archi@@ ved , archiving , viewing , waiting and export@@ ing image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital stock management takes up , inde@@ xed , categor@@ ized , sec@@ ures , searches , trans@@ forms , termin@@ ates and exports content to a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is stored in accordance with your definition data , information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I dare say if you find more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not even need to find a specific photo without inventory management . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; . the approach to save metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving on which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure unlike data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you have to decide whether you want to save other access to your photos if you want to save them to a dedicated drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . keep in mind that you have to switch to a larger drive some@@ time .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be found quickly about your location unless you were in one year several times the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % of work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and work files facilitates a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture .
we also recommend the metadata to save the metadata in &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam site . this ensures EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the relevant item in the menu item .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change it ? to do so , &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; you have a metadata editor available for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts , as you should now select keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that require the same attribute and then set the value .
let us now talk with keywords , keywords , as you frequently wish to say in other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ised images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; automatically re@@ arrange the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . the re @-@ sorting of the hier@@ archy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by drag@@ ging a sub @-@ tree to another .
the graphic shows how different metadata over@@ laps . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the key@@ word - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alog@@ ing your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anyone see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure how your photos will arrive .
look at this panorama . from far away is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say that this is the landing field of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Om@@ aha Beach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . w@@ ow ! you begin to dream , associations to have memories , the historical period of time is again present , you might even hear the silence . so the let@@ tering has completely changed your perception of this panorama .
for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you are moving about what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a let@@ tering for itself alone .
with &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as a label . K@@ DE will even provide you with a spell ch@@ ecker . if you export your images in web galleries , then these labels will be exported to your wishes in the label and / or the title of the web gallery system .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to go to another city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation already travels with speed of light .
the possibilities of explo@@ iting ge@@ ol@@ ocation are already inn@@ um@@ erable and will be deeper in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys using pictures with geo@@ graphic data . &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Google Earth . you can also export the images to Gallery@@ 2 , pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc , with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a pu@@ n with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all modified versions , i.e. also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information in the setup side of &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the photographer &apos;s name , for example , the name of a company or organization can be used .
Aut@@ ot@@ itel ( syn@@ onym for author line ) : associated with the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s job title . examples of this can be titles like : employee photographer , fre@@ el@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who works the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here , which offers you the picture to others . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture offers here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they have no protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ators can delete or modify them in the image . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; in the near future it will provide such a module for batch processing .
topics : plate errors , Plate loss , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ ition
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . this kind of losses are the same that can also happen in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section we are dealing with problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery agency , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
in order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these c@@ auti@@ ous can be treated and you can no longer be trusted than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer to get harder and much more expensive . there are offers about gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claims a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe this is in your discretion .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ read@@ able but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliably .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors , even if you have just written it . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they are aging through chemical aging , ultr@@ avi@@ olet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ B@@ uster which appears to be a miracle in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications read the damaged disks from damaged disks , hard disks , flash drives , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also true for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . also read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store them in a clean , dark dry and protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
Disk@@ manufacturers retain their stat@@ s for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives available :
some of SM@@ ART errors are the most common error cause , SM@@ ART can not detect this error . some of SM@@ ART errors notice the imm@@ in@@ ent failure . these are especially les@@ bi@@ kers and publishing counter@@ s . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems .
while most electric appliances do not make a lot of electricity , this can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . they can cause severe damage to your computer . thus , you can cause these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es to cause complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . thus , protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able result resulting in a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . remember , however , that not every connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection then you should ensure that it meets the UL 1449 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care that it provides protection against lighten@@ ing and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that even all peripher@@ als connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers also provide voltage support , which also includes a telephone connector for your modem . others offer connectivity for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mo@@ de@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in a non @-@ inter@@ rup@@ tive power supply .
in addition to protecting against sur@@ ges , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and run the system safely . if you purchase a US@@ V then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare its safety with the costs of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 .
the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Sim@@ ple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software .
however , they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data over the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are stored on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online .
from the perspective of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . due to the TCP protocol , transmission errors are automatically adjusted and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are disaster @-@ proof .
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in the calcul@@ ator . all transm@@ issions are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem must at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst part is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you have to open a photo one day and this is to your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought about it . no one seems to have ever thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . with normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk fail@@ ures on a low level and are highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard on a G@@ PL . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in the Alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms the Z@@ FS is used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % for work@@ station systems . for not@@ ebooks , the share of the@@ ft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage than for example the@@ ft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted .
open source fil@@ es@@ ystems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the distributed file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden inter@@ ruption during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , the@@ ft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . this means that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this limit .
even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deteri@@ or@@ ates . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 750@@ GB hard disk today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not blame anybody else for data loss . so , backup your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you make any more dangerous than re @-@ installing your operating system , the replacement of disks or the resi@@ zing of hard drives .
suppose you make daily your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash hit you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . don &apos;t forget your air@@ plane crash : fire , water , electricity , children and the@@ ft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or entire house .
therefore disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , to the neighboring house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time at which such backup has been made . this backup comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system the next one with the exception that it is only get@@ ast@@ et and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
save important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or any other visual media .
at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
themes : metadata , stored in the image file , stored IP@@ TC information , associate X@@ MP files , original retain , store , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eve images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing equipment ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable images will survive the next 40 year that is about the period in which you really are interested in because you remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predic@@ table due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with cau@@ tion and re @-@ evaluate while the time goes . unfortunately , there is no other way than a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible . the fewer variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the professional print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means actually increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability with and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it to a new record :
check with the d@@ mes@@ g command to see if your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang them .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ dc &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and reis@@ er@@ fs &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # changing the size of the reis@@ er@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software available to read , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
PNG has been designed as an open source standard designed to replace GIF . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG may have relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF needs and has a slow compression .
TIFF could be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorith@@ m ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras , you can store your pictures in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a licensed and open frame format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is required to use metadata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer puts DNG right now and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it some@@ time .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Educ@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a labelling technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers move it before an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archive . X@@ MP adap@@ ts as it stores metadata separately from the image file . however , it may cause problems when you link between the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ CM@@ I &apos;s activities include the work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I Working Groups , Annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and informative efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera graph , you can use it as temporary backup .
convert raw files to DNG and save them to your raw archive . this feature is not implemented yet .
you can use external programs for fine editing . if you edit the images again with &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; then you should add the metadata again . these were cut off by the other programs .
protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them into web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; in the Ad@@ ding a Photos to an Album you will find a description how to add photos you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your Alb@@ any database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera on display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not show thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the file association settings are displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image is not yet downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras are not available for all information .
the tab Metad@@ ata displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the Metad@@ ata page bar from the main window of &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; or image editing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection from all . this loads all photos from your camera into one album in &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all the photos , you can select only the desired &amp; k@@ de selection methods . once you have selected the photos , you can download the download button and then download S@@ elected .
if your camera supports this , an option New is available . these images have not yet been downloaded from &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , only the new pictures are downloaded .
the list of the existing albums is shown , how normal folders are sorted , displayed . the list of the existing albums is shown , how normal folders are sorted , displayed . then select the list of records from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All . if you only want to delete some , then you must select it first and then delete selected deleted files .
please note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check whether the photos were successfully downloaded into a &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; album before you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete them from the camera , you should do so using the camera location , as this is much faster .
cameras are often used as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not very meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually used again after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can result in double fil@@ en@@ ames if you load photos from different recording criteria into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was taken into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mir@@ r@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based bas@@ kets . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically .
the first two affect the data about the author in the Standard Aut@@ ori@@ dent@@ ity section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix for example : % M : % S in the edit box . turn the option date &amp; time . for more adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case letters or upper@@ case letters if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; for a photo used , is shown below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window the next time .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the point of time recording to perform an automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the section Head Metad@@ ata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
when your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; this use to automatically load sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section header Met@@ a data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case , &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced Fol@@ der option on the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select Up@@ load . the file sel@@ ector dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; you where the pictures are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Pos@@ iti@@ oning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant that can be displayed in long@@ itude and lat@@ itude and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European G@@ ALI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geo@@ graphic location . not everyone uses an aircraft to map an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you for@@ got to forget where exactly the photo was done , you can click a browser to display the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; users who want to locate the location of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to add the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map references . there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the correct hardware , via a post @-@ editing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geo@@ graphic assignment ( manual ) and most recently by manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a map module or by transferring the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save this data in the g@@ px format as this is the only format supported by the module for geographical allocation .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the privileges to be created for example by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ g@@ le.com does not show any European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; try to give as much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; change . to access these settings , you must specify in the Settings menu . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
select action can be displayed on embedded pre@@ views or editing image editing . you specify the default behavior of &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected for downloading from the camera interface . also in database synchron@@ isation , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ot@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for head@@ line : this field should include the professional designation of the photographer . this can be descriptions such as a photographer , fre@@ el@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for vendors : use this field to specify the image that the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if this is a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here , as this is the picture of another &amp; quot ; offer &amp; quot ; . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency should be en@@ um@@ er@@ ated here .
the IP@@ TC @-@ actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC field . this achieves that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; these metadata also contains other programs and can be imported into &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; imported without lost .
save image lab@@ eling as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you add to your photos , with the labels embedded in the pictures . this allows your cap@@ tions to be read from other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter in the main window is over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; di@@ gi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; display , you can add and remove the extensions of this list . any file in one &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; alb@@ um@@ folder that has none of these extensions , from &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Update to the right of each category .
the settings of the light@@ box from &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam can be set on this page to the default values . each time you open the light@@ box , these settings are switched on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; In all the image size you can only use on fast machines . if you have one , then you can get better view results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn on the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposure areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or light color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image editing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that the images can be enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the near@@ er explanation .
with the PNG @-@ compression setting , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not decrease the image quality , as PNG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorith@@ m . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the option TIFF files , you can switch the DE@@ FLA@@ TE compression algorith@@ m for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no effect on image quality , since the DE@@ FLA@@ TE algorith@@ m works loss @-@ free .
loss @-@ free JPEG @-@ 2000 files can save you loss @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ s@@ less settings , the ratio of quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not supported yet , but was in planning .
in previous versions of &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool for manip@@ ulating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
the default acceptance is that all green pixels are equal . if you react more sensiti@@ vely to ultr@@ avi@@ olet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference produces a mesh pattern in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the picture a bit soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern using the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is to use a solid color balance that was photograph@@ ed on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposure images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the default is it the pointed , so the parts of your pictures are burned into the settings , because of the in@@ ability of your camera to catch the s@@ nu@@ ck@@ ers , as transparent white . the setting colors cause some unusual results since it shows the pointed @-@ lights in various rose shades . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels generally don &apos;t s@@ ati@@ ate as quickly as green and red . &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
put the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; image processing . to keep the time for the demo icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorith@@ m is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix color pixel . this algorith@@ m is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive homo@@ gene@@ ity @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorith@@ m used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it produces color bars on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can put the red and blue proof values here . this is certainly the best method for a sof@@ ten@@ ing correction since you are carried out during cru@@ de conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates colour information and gives instructions on how they should be returned . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; information on how to translate colour information from a color space to the other , so that the colors are as exact as possible .
behavi@@ ors ask questions when an image is opened in image editing / color administration module with raw files .
color profile folder Sets the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; examine this folder then during the start .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be depos@@ ited . everything can be changed later when the raw file is opened .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your pictures are color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
not all profiles are created in the same way . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some such as Canon , which do not contain color@@ ton@@ ic mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not cor@@ relate to conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the gra@@ fic mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from a device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated . this could be corrected manually instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorith@@ m of your printer .
for most cameras , it &apos;s pretty obvious which colour profile is intended for what is intended for . unfortunately , not in the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ officially :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these will then be loaded by &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window and in addition you will find some examples in the context menu of the preview window .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slideshow should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ator adjust@@ s the time between the frame trans@@ itions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds is good . the other check boxes turn the metadata into or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display .
the camera properties show on the left a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Auto Det@@ ection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in image display mode . below are the port settings . currently , there are serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , where you can mount your camera .
to use &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam your digital camera ; you need to connect the camera to your computer to bring and turn them into the display mode .
try whether &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can manually set camera model and port . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window pane of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving pictures in the tr@@ ash bin , you can indicate the conversation of &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections of del@@ eting a photo and dele@@ tion of an album you will find further details .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; if you use the option to apply changes to the right side bar without any queries , otherwise you need to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also display the welcome screen from &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; in case of stopping , this acceler@@ ates the starting process of &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; .
the setting When starting new pictures forces &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; . if something dropped from the base folder , queries &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; you know if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; includes fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view and correct your photos and edit and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the Preview / Edit entry .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; so you may not be part of your distribution . you will find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the image editing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size indicates .
a menu bar at the top and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most commonly used functions .
the editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file Save or the button Save from the toolbar . note that you can &apos;t restore the original photo once you have saved the picture .
you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save this with file Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by rest@@ oring it from the File menu or using the button The Rec@@ over of Image Processing in the toolbar . you then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last save .
virtually any action of image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . you can undo the last action by selecting Edit Back@@ ground or restored by selecting Edit Rem@@ over from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should use the keyboard short@@ cuts , Ctr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and Ctr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB on the toolbar button in the toolbar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will also be revers@@ ed and restored .
once you have started image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it .
you can zoom into the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the menu toolbar .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select a magni@@ fication factor automatically
view full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come in the normal view where you can use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can change this in the Settings dialog from &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; you can change it from the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; main window . see the section for setting image editing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can choose to print the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings before printing your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . entire image thumb@@ nails can be selected from your selection . you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select from the menu Album Export printer wiz@@ ard . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; main window has a side bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available without the navigation path , also available in image editing . it will appear when one of the five tab@@ s is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same rider allows the side@@ bar to appear or go back to the edge .
in the label view , you can enter in@@ scriptions with unlimited size or insert . note the note down . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are revers@@ ed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented on it , use either the button App@@ ly or simply switch to the next picture , the labels will then be saved .
in addition to the Application button , you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this will always be done when you have chosen a metadata setting which is always written in the pictures .
the rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut Ctr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select it and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field of ur@@ gency . the enco@@ ding follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the key@@ word tree , and a selection box containing the keywords used previously at this &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; session .
the key@@ word tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the entered search word . you can restri@@ ct the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the corresponding boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the key@@ word IP@@ TC field .
if you select multiple images in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this will only apply to the highlighted picture and not the whole selection , if you want to use a key@@ word , please read the section key@@ word filter .
the key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of pictures displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar with their album , - date , stit@@ ch and search results is used . if additionally one or more key@@ word filters are used from the right , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and place keywords . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view to use keywords . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and put it to the selection . then a dialog box that asks you if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three pictures . they were selected with Ctr@@ l + a , and then a key@@ word was drawn from the right key@@ word tree to the selection and placed there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings .
if you have created and created a rule and find that it should be one or one , you can easily change it by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , picture , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set a Advanced search for all the elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :
why have pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; s specific implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predic@@ table devi@@ ation from the actually photograph@@ ed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web which correspond to those from your digital dar@@ k@@ room .
if the subject comes to color management , then everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , colour management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , then you do not have to worry about color administration .
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see further information below )
your only other image issues are via e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ fac@@ to standard .
so if s@@ RGB is so good working and makes life easier for everyone , why should one use another color space and thus have to think about color p@@ ant@@ ages ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB &apos;s limitation compared to the colors we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger paint boo@@ ths , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and first click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to cal@@ y my monitor if I decided to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in a s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to cal@@ li@@ y your monitor since s@@ RGB is cal@@ li@@ zed on s@@ RGB , then you either need to cal@@ li@@ y your monitor to s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , please use it before you attempt any further manual editing .
the functions norm@@ alize , compens@@ ate , automatic synchron@@ ization and contrast extend from the menu of the Automatic Cor@@ rection menu automatically trying out of your colors the best . you &apos;ll have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ous values over the entire image , so that the dar@@ k@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its shade . this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or well @-@ washed .
this method adjust@@ s the brightness of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity can be as flat as possible . it sometimes produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that causes miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it det@@ ects the dark and light tones and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range and a real@@ ign@@ ment of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white balance from &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited to a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . so if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorith@@ m that is protected by Pa@@ wel T. Joch@@ ym . you start it using the menu item Color White Compar@@ ison of Image Processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side both the original image and the preview of the target picture can be seen . the preview is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again then it is enough to click on the sub @-@ window .
the thumb@@ nail preview has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the right side , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynam@@ ically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful there , even in well lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or dim the shots of your photos .
to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then click anywhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the colour temperature of the white balance . in this way the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one colour channel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in the white balance . this is shown as pure indicator in the preview and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button sets all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in another photo as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the enco@@ ding depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this enco@@ ding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG formats .
this tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be performed by the sub @-@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for the use of color profiles can be consul@@ ted from chapter colour management .
another important tool is available in the menu under Color Sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to save your settings at the same time . this is useful if your camera or scanner always need the same error and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for grad@@ ation that you can find in color grad@@ ation in the menu .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a Solar@@ is@@ ation@@ se@@ ff@@ ect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ teen filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that resulted in a partially developed pressure from the additional light . this had the effect that lighter areas were dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a partial negative of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
intensity controls the solar system . at about 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on phot@@ op@@ aper .
this is an example of the solar energy effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid @-@ filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it emb@@ ell@@ ishes a lot of photos .
Vel@@ via is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and there@@ with a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contr@@ asts . Vel@@ vi@@ as are strongly saturated color but also some photographers , especially those that barely clear landscapes , too much .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ ders repet@@ itions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large pictures , the filter can wei@@ gh the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to adjust the color contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem : one too great satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . all changes you can carry out can be viewed in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex mould Grad@@ ation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is based on sound correction to improve exposure . even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated , you need only the range of sli@@ ders explained here . more concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to operate is to shift the controls and make sure the image changes .
on the right side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is updated dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the picture . the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to set the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear representation is most useful . in pictures the large areas of a constant color are dominated the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic division is more useful .
three regul@@ ators : the top one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called Gam@@ ma@@ vera .
the three color pin@@ p@@ ettes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows , middle and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is one button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to edit the output values inter@@ actively as in the input rate . the compression of the output values can e.g. be used to create an extended image as background while something else in the fore@@ ground is to be seen .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : using these buttons , the set values in the fil@@ esystem can be saved and loaded later . in addition , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shadows , means and sun @-@ tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ous channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target picture will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right hand side , the following options are available :
modi@@ fi@@ zi@@ ere channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel which changes from the module :
beside this box there are two icons to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , linear mode is most useful . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with dar@@ ker output tones and the corresponding image pixels are dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original pictures you can see a red marker . if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve that you created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , medium and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you will get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ Channel . shadow and sun @-@ tones were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel @-@ mixer of &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
the channel selection box lets you select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ators for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ anz , the image will retain the general brightness as the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour@@ ing . colour@@ ing consists of small diamond art@@ e@@ ads that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and their smoking patterns in each channel are different . if that is the case , you can improve your Mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color space first .
save as and store buttons are used for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can save you later and then load it . the file format used is the g@@ im@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ anz option is checked . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the modified image below ( 2 ) .
black / White photography has always been fascinating for your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step because color images can be easily converted to the machine . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green Filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white fil@@ let light with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white fil@@ let light with an orange l@@ ense filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red Filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white fil@@ let light with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic can@@ opy effects and can sim@@ ulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of the day . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
gel Filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white fil@@ let light with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) gel filters .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm light and middle sounds while adding a bit of cold in the shadows . this is very similar to the process of leaving a pressure and the re@@ development in a sep@@ tile . this is typical of the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; mold texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it &apos;s a color image or not , you can look it like an oil painting on canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a m@@ ural on a wall . the menu item Image texture using image editing can be used for this .
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper texture effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) to see . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . thoroughly cut the picture with a colored line , Nie@@ p@@ ce finishes it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , sh@@ kant@@ y finishes it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for width is from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of the pictures , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any location . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text device , orientation , color from color space and character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . the image is ready .
each setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; using the tools template , you can place a template using a picture .
the menu image template used in image editing can be used to lay st@@ encils via a picture .
for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to decrease the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; st@@ encil data bank , just send an email in English to the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; mail@@ ing@@ list di@@ gi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for first time , you need to set your st@@ encil template with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the st@@ encil files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
once the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view reflects the template folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder will update the templates toolbar .
pre@@ views are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and position of your image .
enlarge This button magni@@ fies the picture below . it is c@@ entered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this button reduces the image below . it is c@@ entered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image appropri@@ ately . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adapted to the preview size .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but generates particularly in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
the sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it doesn &apos;t work a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes here a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
images without focus as well as most dig@@ iti@@ zed images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digit@@ alization process must be combined with only minimal differences to a color point . this , in turn , causes sharp edges to become a bit bl@@ ur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally need more subsequently shar@@ pen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG images , internal sharp@@ ness is often applied . images in the rough format , on the other hand , must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
some scanner already uses a focus filter while reading the image . if you disable this , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the sharp@@ ness of the focus . you can call the focus on the menu item .
you should be careful , however , as the results do not work very naturally : shar@@ pen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the noise . in general , the most useful technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus the tool . you will achieve more information and comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture slightly soft@@ ly is much easier than shar@@ pen@@ ing it . use the tool to sof@@ ten the picture with the menu item , and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount intensi@@ fy the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , the noise and the impression of gr@@ aten will produce in the proximity of sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of a edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . therefore , you should best sharp@@ ly view images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ red picture added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference of difference . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference thus for a edge of the filter . in this way areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from shar@@ pen@@ ing and hence beauty error in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ king filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the edited picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focused an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted Ent@@ f@@ alt@@ ungs @-@ Filter algorith@@ m by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than trying to shar@@ pen the picture . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ terung . the traditional technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing pictures is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focus mostly better results than un@@ sharp mas@@ king . you can start it from the menu by calling colors re@@ focusing in image editing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the pal@@ ate &apos;s fold . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s fold has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the sw@@ elling pix@@ els that are far from the original source pixels . in most cases , the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ itting is even influenced by the removed pixels . this causes und@@ esi@@ red results .
circular shar@@ pen@@ ing : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures , the default value should give 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red then however on Heiligen@@ sch@@ eine .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,95 and 0,99 . a high value for cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will even further contamin@@ ate the image .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness . this parameter is most often caused by a previously executed un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing filter . in most cases , you should set this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying art@@ e@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal zero , you may also need to increase the cor@@ relation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the matrix matrix . an increase in die size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular shar@@ pen@@ ing or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note , however , that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
save as and store buttons are used for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all cuts , color and intensity patterns on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible , which leave behind unpleasant art@@ e@@ facts later .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; than JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ ks produce better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by using bl@@ ur@@ ly mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
in theory , un@@ sharp mas@@ king must always create arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ focused color image needs to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of shar@@ pen@@ ing in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regul@@ ator gla@@ zing sets the sharp@@ ness of the area that has been dar@@ ken@@ ed to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink tin@@ ted allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can adjust it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to avoid unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the in@@ painting algorith@@ m was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings fine you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings .
detailed attitude p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to an even smoo@@ ther about the picture . if larger values are mainly homo@@ geneous regions smoo@@ then and let details focus sharp@@ ly . a value of 0.9 should get details so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing is afterwards necessary . note that the detailed attitude should always be subordin@@ ated to the direction of orientation .
direction depen@@ dency : alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes ev@@ enly in all directions , while a value close to 1 is smoo@@ thed in one direction . if you have a film gr@@ itt or CCD noise , a high value will generate wav@@ e@@ form patterns . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te is best removed with a value close to 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ th@@ ness factor above all . p then defines the relative smoothing . therefore set this value appropriate to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher this value , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when a lot of noise is present , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : indicates how often the algorith@@ m is passed through . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angular grad@@ ations &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , there should also be small selected . be sure that small angles provide a long run@@ time . thus , you should ideally choose this value and acceptable for your needs .
integral ste@@ pping width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral ste@@ pper width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never greater than 2 .
using linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the More to Quality that you receive by selecting this option is only low , but it dou@@ bles the running time . we recommend it to allow it to ski@@ p it .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and re@@ loaded later .
corrected image errors is compar@@ atively very fast during work . however , it can take very long time and get a high CPU load after you move . therefore , you can break the calculation at any time using the button Cancel .
below you can see how to remove image errors with Small Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculi@@ ar black arti@@ fact in the fore@@ ground that caused by a bad film shift during the trip . the original picture is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
die &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; Rau@@ sch@@ redu@@ ktion is a very powerful tool to reduce drau@@ ghts . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorith@@ m by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove spots and other arti@@ facts that come from dust or ha@@ irs on the lens . it can also be used to remove sen@@ sing noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed using this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can remain in default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can wi@@ pe the image .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel pitch the filter looks forward to pin@@ point the brightness changes . if it is increased , noise points are deleted . you may need to adjust the edge filter if you change this setting . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication appears again .
edges : controls edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong cannot be removed all the noise or diamond tips can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ e@@ facts without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance density : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either changing color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings .
colour : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ing tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically rough@@ ened to increase . however , it also contamin@@ ates the shadow areas .
d@@ amping : controls the adjusting of the phase j@@ itter atten@@ u@@ ation . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smoo@@ ther if it is too high , noise can occur . it can remove noise points and is the recommended method for it .
save and load : these buttons are used for this purpose . all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction has been applied to default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the soft mark with the menu item Con@@ du@@ cts sof@@ ten@@ ing and experiment with the smoo@@ th@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
die &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; Photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ e@@ facts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove pal@@ ate , film grain , scrat@@ ches , compression bars and local errors that appear in digital , original or retro@@ active dig@@ iti@@ zed images . the smoothing takes place along the con@@ tours and thereby gets the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorith@@ m can be used for color and texture creation . the texture creation is developed using another tool , the image error correction . the algorith@@ m for the restoration was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ na , and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te Redu@@ ction : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ s@@ less compression algorith@@ m , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ e@@ facts ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
photo @-@ restoration is compar@@ atively very fast during work . however , it can take very long time and take a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
below you can see like a photo with uniform noise reduction . the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a mint ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious movie grains on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected one ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures have been applied to an old color photo , which was scann@@ ed with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ e@@ facts that were caused by the scanner illumination and the phot@@ op@@ aper . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove hot@@ pixels from photos with a CCD camera gem , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , which are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are particularly problem@@ atic in high @-@ quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark picture directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the right dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard notes the last dark picture and will automatically load it in the next session .
the image area and preview help to correct the result inside the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all preview areas .
select an area to preview the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to polish these pixels . these are the available filters :
thir@@ st : an average of the adjacent pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to polish the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pix@@ el@@ block are drawn to comp@@ ute a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to polish the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to polish the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
die &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; v@@ ign@@ et@@ ti@@ fication correction is a tool to correct the v@@ ign@@ et@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposure corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not ev@@ enly illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; v@@ ign@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed under certain circumstances , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should , also with center filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise bl@@ ur@@ ring effects are created by motion .
with the wide exposure ranges of today &apos;s filtering and color or gre@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equi@@ val@@ ent transformation to a raw image without this filter . the tool v@@ ign@@ et@@ ti@@ fication correction turns the transformation with a center filter on a picture . the algorith@@ m is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by John Walker .
with three controllers , you can control the v@@ ign@@ et@@ ti@@ fication correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light rein@@ forcement at the point of the biggest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which compens@@ ates an optical filter with an aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , . increases the density by a greater degree of v@@ ign@@ et@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : the editing of an image with the v@@ ign@@ et@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the regul@@ ators only provide positive values because you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er adjustment of the exposure of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the grad@@ ation from the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; image processing from the menu color grad@@ ation .
this is an example of the v@@ ign@@ et@@ ti@@ fication correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the v@@ ign@@ et@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ ous and contrast correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; lens dist@@ ortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorith@@ m by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tions . color dist@@ or@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect , but flat on the edges . this correction is not applied in the mold .
the coefficient of the coefficient is fixed to the remote corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion can be almost eliminated .
in general : this value controls the strength of dist@@ ortion second degree . with negative values t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical dist@@ or@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion dist@@ ortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of dist@@ ortion fourth degree . this value affects the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; corners &apos; has the inver@@ ted character of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thereby reduces the first degree of c@@ ades . negative values increase while positive the image dimin@@ ishes .
bright : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview will illustrate the dist@@ ortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used at the next start as default values .
the t@@ onn@@ - or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all tri@@ mming or size changes . best perform this correction as all the first . if you re @-@ cut an image and then perform a t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical correction , the effect would be apparently the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to view the dotted lines . move the mouse poin@@ ter to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the t@@ onn@@ - / kis@@ sing dist@@ ortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a ver@@ tically dist@@ ortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove this with the cutting tool in the menu Trans@@ former tri@@ mming from the image editing or using the zoom slider of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs like images from the front , frames and paintings makes it the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight dist@@ ortion of perspective .
this is an example of t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorith@@ m is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared movie , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview , you can set two parameters of film gr@@ itt and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the Add film gr@@ itt option if you want to sim@@ ulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regul@@ ator changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mi@@ xes colour channels for re@@ producing infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , since the colour information is missing .
this is an example of infrared fil@@ ming applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) to see . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the peak lights .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; filter film gr@@ itt is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool for re@@ producing film grain on your pictures . it is known from classic high @-@ speed films like the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo em@@ ulsion .
the image effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back to the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere of daily life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , stre@@ et@@ photo , gra@@ iny appearance specifically in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the grains . the default value is , although frequently higher values are needed to be set to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more grains , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film editing effect applied to a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited version ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life @-@ life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brush is better suited for large images . fl@@ atten the smoo@@ th@@ ness or from the other side , the mag@@ nific@@ ence .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ete is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoo@@ ther 17 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal sketch . images of their gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you had chosen to outline you . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( smoo@@ th@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; filter engraving shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important on the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ ochro@@ me landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtration . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited picture ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using dist@@ ortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look like it is seen through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 the picture is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pe the picture along star @-@ shaped lines that go from a central point . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often visible in sports photography .
radi@@ al sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image by turning the pixels at a central point . this sim@@ ulates the bl@@ ur of a rotating camera .
distance bl@@ ur : wi@@ pe the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to be back in the background .
motion bl@@ ur : wi@@ pe the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the bl@@ ur of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train , camera .
sof@@ ten@@ ing bl@@ ur : the image ev@@ okes soft@@ ly into the dark and strongly in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton Eff@@ ect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sh@@ out bl@@ ur : wi@@ pe the image by random shift of the pixels and thus sim@@ ulates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a random moving camera .
smart bl@@ ur@@ ring : finds the color sink in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photograph into rectangular cells and then creates it through the filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives it natural your pictures a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n ri@@ ghtly protected algorith@@ m .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of the drops . as the dro@@ ple@@ t size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
you can use the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; image processing a area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that should stay free . if you start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the edited picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can move it through mirrors or turning into the correct orientation . tools for this can be found in the Transformation Dre@@ ws or transformation mirrors .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and hold the details sharp@@ ly ? how can you zoom in a picture when the boundaries of the resolution are reached ? how can you inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? how can you inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool to change size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approxim@@ ate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool for infl@@ ating .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorith@@ m photo bub@@ bles was developed by IMA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below :
keep aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the new size of the original image is retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher this value , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when a lot of noise is present , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the buttons save as and load are used for this purpose . a text file can be saved as a text file and loaded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast in what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
you can see below an example of photo bub@@ bles by magni@@ fying a small picture of the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard aug@@ mentation compared .
the image editing allows this very easy . to cut a photo you just have to use the rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rec@@ t@@ angle . you will see this rec@@ t@@ angle while moving the mouse .
you can change the size of the area to be cut by drag@@ ging at the corners of the rec@@ t@@ angle . you can create a new rec@@ t@@ angle by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The cutting button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( Ctr@@ l ; + X ) . use the File Save or Save file from the File menu to save the newly edited photo .
in the Preview pane you can change the size of the rec@@ t@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be retained .
in the tool Accor@@ ding to the aspect ratio you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of height and width is assigned to the width .
cut the tool after aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centi@@ meters , inches or any other physical size . you can , for example , see a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically c@@ entering the selection horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
below in the dialog you can set the max. ratio kno@@ b to the wid@@ est possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool After aspect ratio increases its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut picture and not the original image .
the settings of the composition help make it possible to f@@ ade help in order to make your pictures better together . these aids are :
harmonious triangle : harmonious part@@ itions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ level rule , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rec@@ t@@ angle in a similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles on the diag@@ onal .
golden Mitte : the golden center is a division that is on different natural growth patterns , such as the spir@@ als of a N@@ auti@@ lus sea shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we perceive as beautiful .
the golden ratio is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who built your tem@@ ples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden partition at all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ ac@@ ci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two preceding numbers .
the gold center provides liquid auxiliary lines when you put a picture together . these aids are listed below :
the golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third level , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow through the image . this type of composition guides the viewer &apos;s ga@@ ze along the line of spir@@ als and creates a symmet@@ rical visual river .
a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spir@@ als . it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles are also derived from the above @-@ discussed golden spiral . their ver@@ tex points are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to the harmonious tri@@ angles , golden triangle are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can be issued a static object dynamic .
if you use gold tri@@ angles to break down your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not achieve otherwise .
the options horizontal mirror and vertical mirrors can be used to reflect the harmonious parts .
with the button paint you can set the color of the guides . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can become invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate a picture at any angle .
if you make a photo , it &apos;s easy that you do not keep the camera ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with the rot@@ ate ; image editing and the tool free rotation .
rot@@ ate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . with the default settings button , you can set the slider to 0 degree . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right .
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
once you have fil@@ med an image , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is to use the trans@@ former tri@@ mming function from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cut . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smoothing the picture a bit after the rotation . but note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ al transform@@ ations are carried out by a point of reference to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically re@@ charged . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including empty areas created by transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including empty areas created by transformation , in pixels .
angle left above : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right at the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left bottom : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a bit dirty . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you &apos;ve adapted the perspective you get ti@@ ghtly tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with trans@@ former tri@@ mming from the image processing .
the sc@@ aling tool is used to shift a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite side . this is no rotation , the image is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rec@@ t@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module by trans@@ forming sc@@ iss@@ ors .
sc@@ iss@@ ors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can sh@@ ave horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you press on pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will show you and the new dimensions of the target picture are displayed on the right of the preview pane .
move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sc@@ aling tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture is wi@@ ped a bit . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sh@@ ear@@ ings generate twice as much ev@@ acu@@ ation and therefore you should avoid this .
after she@@ eting , the picture has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with trans@@ former tri@@ mming from the image processing .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ;
because of this depen@@ dency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats at this point . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF below .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; displays only files in formats that are aware of . this is done by means of file extension and a comparison of them with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; you can change this list of file extensions that &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; you can change this list of file extensions .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select the format you want to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found on Wikipedia . &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced in order to save the image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG with the same compression ratio .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; in the section configuration section , you will find further information on how to use modules with &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; supports the loading of shell pictures only with d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of shell formats that &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often saved in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; is not a film editing program and therefore does not have a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in options to display or edit films . if you click on a movie file &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for viewing movies use to start the program for playback .

many tools you need the photo processing are in &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; contain . your description will follow here .
all image editing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft marks , noise supp@@ ression , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a unified dialog type , which shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; Tex@@ ture application @-@ quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar indicates the status of the filter on the current image . left of it allows five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
ver@@ tically , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected area .
horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper part shows the original and the lower part shows the filter applied to the area below the selected area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper part shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter .

after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file is currently modified by another program , the following window will appear :
you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ loaded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; co@@ graph@@ inter@@ viewer ; you can also remember your decision , so that later it is also possible . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item Settings k@@ Grap@@ viewer ; set up ... , see also .
when you open a Graph@@ ite file outside a running &amp; k@@ Grap@@ viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ Grap@@ viewer ; instance or want to display the graphs to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the Setup dialog .
at the start of the program , you can open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how to divide the graph on several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you are using several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph are to be placed on this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with one or more pages distributed without head@@ line and with another font
the Renew@@ able Load page gives the option to set the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk , and eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore changes ) or ask the program each time .
opening the page opens the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ inter@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside a current session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the session administration page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ inter@@ viewer ; you can set a standard behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at each start afterwards .
the context menu , which usually appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries shown on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ Algorith@@ m , the standard for directed graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered represent@@ ations of directed graphs . the algorith@@ m lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edges of edges as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorith@@ m is the standard for un@@ coated graphs . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorith@@ m is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; -@@ algorith@@ m creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model for un@@ coated graphs . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Pure gold header , and includes a multi @-@ purpose trigger for treating large and clust@@ ered graphs .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; -@@ algorith@@ m arran@@ ges the k@@ not according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and me@@ adow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyc@@ lic structures .
opens a dialog in which you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should give the graph file as parameters , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format . with such a layout commands you can give &amp; eg ; algorith@@ m special options , or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ zed ) and applies the standard algorith@@ m for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ at@@ to ; for non @-@ directed graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
shows the What is the mouse poin@@ ter . click on a &amp; GUI with this mouse poin@@ ter to get further help to this item ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available under this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the base folder of the source repository .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ inter@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools for displaying . it needs the following program packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; co@@ graph@@ inter@@ viewer ; you will find further options in the Settings menu .
the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five sections : the main toolbar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ paint palette and the grid in which you draw the symbol .
create a new symbol . if the current file has been modified , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog will appear where you can choose whether the icon should be created from a template , or whether you want to restart from scratch .
re@@ stores the last revers@@ ed step . if you do not have a step back , this function is disabled .
insert the contents of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gray scales . this can create colors that do not match those of the symbol palette .
does not change the symbol , but sets the current drawing color to the color of the point on which you click .
the status bar displays the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
insert the contents of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up a dialog with the three pages templates for icons , background and symbol gr@@ ills .
with buttons Add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc .
choose Transpar@@ ent Pixel or Show Lin@@ e@@ els and display Un@@ icol@@ oured : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as transparent display . you can also set the size : the Kar@@ os on Klein , Medium and Great as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : select .
the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to em@@ bed new images and save them .
this module can be used to em@@ bed and store new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner by the s@@ ane project supported or another source like video streams . to do this , you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and s@@ ane installed .
when you open the menu item , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default values of Du@@ cr@@ he &apos;s own to select your image . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you click the button . the estimated file size will show you in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure the window is displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed .
after you have cli@@ cked the button , you need to wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the options of the target image appears . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . please remember that the BMP file is not compressed and therefore very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 .
screen@@ shots you can create after you have selected in the Import &gt; screen@@ shot menu . a window appears where you can set the different screen@@ shots :
select The complete work area to read a single window under the mouse .
when all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , read the currently visible workplace . if you have picked up the entire desktop , only the window is read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other desktop , you should select this delay enough to get the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog box options appear with the options described above .

if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a to@@ ken . this is used for your authentication . thus , it is virtually your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Website . you will be presented the following page after a successful registration .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressed on Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
if the module will start export@@ ing to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which shows the current per@@ missions that the module indicates . you need write permission . the module currently does not support any other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button View Add Photos should be pushed once you have set any other options . using this button , you can select the photos you want to upload . if you click on the O@@ k button , the upload of the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server starts .
the tags field can be filled with a list of words separated by com@@ ma . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload .
with the options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ ly you can set the per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as a private .
if you select the option Change the size of the photos before loading , the photos are changed in front of the upload in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size .
maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery @-@ Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery @-@ Export does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geo@@ graphic loc@@ alisation allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geo@@ graphic data are stored in the EX@@ IF stit@@ ches of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alisation provides tools for loc@@ alizing images geograph@@ ically in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and lat@@ itude are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS Track as an XML file in the g@@ px format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical Loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog then appears . in order to result in a possible cor@@ relation of time and location , you need to load a track file with G@@ PX file . of course , this file contains data that were taken at the same locations as the images of your camera .
when loading the file an automatic cor@@ relation shows the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS @-@ time and camera time . the devi@@ ation below the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data of a location for images , you can manually edit the g@@ px file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ation and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have suitable data . if you know that in reality a location lies in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog opens the coordinates from one call to the next one , you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location may also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region in question and increase si@@ e.@@ Fo@@ rec@@ t this again and again until you have reached sufficient accuracy . the height must always be manually selected . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ if@@ tool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that can be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the choice allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the albums will not be displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below it will show the preview and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page .
the tab displays the overall appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option for each image to create a page creates a new page where the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; k@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the tab defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub @-@ folder named KI@@ PI@@ HTML Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be saved in the new pictures .
with other color depth you can change the default color depth . naturally , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nails will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the programs to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or shifting . the viewer can be used with short commands and folders . it has been designed for quick picture display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a win@@ dow@@ ed mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free Module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to store images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual losses of quality or metadata .
the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size is rising , as no compression of colour information takes place . this can be found e.g. in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then open the import function . this opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the metadata . the data will be copied after you click the OK button .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but not to each target format . JPEG is supported in writing . please take a look at ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual pictures you can add a basic tutorial . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slideshow . using this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slideshow . after that , you can start creating the module using Tools MPEG Slideshow .
the pictures you selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio . you can also change the pictures or the contents of the list .
after you are happy with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you are planning to play the file on a television , you need to choose the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre@@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds the one image is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value produces very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let them black . the name and path of the generated file can be set in the name of the MPEG output file . keep in mind as soon as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , then it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start the creation of the movie with the button . depending on the speed of your computer you can now drink a coffee and enjoy the slideshow once you are back .
if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages using the Settings button on the right .
the printer wiz@@ ard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo formats . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is for example : useful to improve you or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import and convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the RAW file to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the button Preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the converting result . the fil@@ en@@ ame stays the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorith@@ m and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
the Tagged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you are planning to manip@@ ulate your images frequently or otherwise , you should not choose the JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of sur@@ geri@@ es before the image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start converting with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can zoom or enlarge the image . there are four types of image changes available :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size changes in one dimension . width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : change in size in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not Pro@@ por@@ tional : not proportional to proportions in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed in this option .
pres@@ et@@ ching : prepar@@ es the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo api@@ ker . the target image , including background size , mar@@ ginal size and background color , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before . you can drag and drop additional images to the list of images to be sent .
after you started the module , the image window will be displayed with the pictures you select . you can add more images to the left with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right .
you can also drag images to the picture list and place it there to add you to the list of images to be sent .
with the button images remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
once you have selected all the images , you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you select are attached to the attachment .
don &apos;t mind to send too many pictures at once . most email accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and used every time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after adding comments to an attached file , the comments to the images added to a text file are added and the mail is added .
the PNG format below the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best suited to los@@ s@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format , the original Ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is done , the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages , searching for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au there will be a window with questions like you want to show your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL option in the presentation will activate very elegant image trans@@ itions using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option displays the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a loop loop . you can then manually Cancel with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly choose to show that the images are displayed in a random order . thus , the sequence of images is not used in the album .
the distance between the pictures can be set between the pictures . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . by chance , each transition between the images sel@@ ects another effect .
during the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn on .
with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slideshow .
at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the desktop .
this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have completed your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see picture . as you can see by comparison with the picture , are now available in each group , so in people , places and in group key@@ word entries .
in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have entered your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
when using the mouse on the entry people , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person , only the pictures shown on which both persons can be seen . through this selection method , you can restri@@ ct the number of pictures shown by a few thousand pictures to a few individual pictures .
if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view with thumb@@ nails to view the images of your activity .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , which is of course also valid for places , keywords and other categories you have defined by yourself . see the picture .
to view images besides the names , select the button on the right side of the toolbar . in the pop @-@ up context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can view the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display icons with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have appropriate images for your keywords ) .
you must , however , select the image to display for each individual person . to do this , you need to open the image @-@ view window ( described in more detail ) and in the context menu , you can select the image for the corresponding person . here you can customize the image for the corresponding person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed and / or cut off .
when you view searches in the main window , a dialog will appear , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once again .
if you enter a string into the lab@@ eling or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window , you can browse all the images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here you can see pictures where Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are shown .
this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but want to try out the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the Quick Start , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , if you start the first time , or select the photo@@ album button in the Help menu . then some sample images are loaded and you can test the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name suggests , this list shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed thumb@@ nail view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be shown in the preview pane ) and also the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate to the preview pane .
you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button down and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select a range , in the preview view only images of this time period will appear . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a tim@@ eline bar .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; introduces two ways to create HTML websites with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as a module ( see ) . the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create using the menu File HTML ...
before creating HTML pages you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and destination . in the following , each section is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the moment and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ Ex@@ ample @-@ Pages you see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created on the overview page . learn more about the export files in .
finally , you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information displayed on the viewer even without a description . for example , that all pictures are from a party . note that all pictures are from a party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why this is not addressed specifically .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thus , those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified , so it can scan your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image bigger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting area , place the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
the best option is to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub @-@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if they really are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created . the URL you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy it to it . so that the import function , see , correctly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub @-@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings described above have all three related to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may want to share your pictures with them . you can of course apply a HTML page to view the pictures .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images are stored in the file or if the file is only a short@@ cut to images . the advantage of saving all the images into the file is that you can have all the images together and can pass this file independently . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you have specified when creating the html files are searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for export@@ ing images is described , which you can view from the File Export menu ...
the most important option of this dialog is whether it &apos;s about internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three options are available :
you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file with the Manu@@ ell option to the .@@ k@@ im file .
copy &amp; paste the images automatically to the .@@ k@@ im file ; the images are automatically copied for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to , just choose the Export File option .
the last option of this page is to limit image size . if you send images to your friends , you may not want to send the images in full size as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
when you import a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu ... Select , will &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; import the exported database as described in .
the wiz@@ ard for import@@ ing consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category of individuals of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is called for your database . therefore , in the third dialog box , you will be asked which categories of the imported file are to be imported and which categories they are in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen on the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and watch images : if you look for pictures , you often want to see pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will pass the different steps of ( 1 ) to set the information about your images , via ( 2 ) the search and view , through to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; saves all its information in the file index@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notes the folder in which your images are stored and use it again with future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can start another folder tree with pictures , you can start with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / index@@ .x@@ ml .
using the menu item settings photo@@ album ; set up ... come to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual we will explain the different settings .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which you can call by pressing the F1 key and one click on the desired option .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the Options dialog , sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog box , you can set up complete groups of members , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group , rather than all groups of a member , as explained in .
in the selection list you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as di@@ gi@@ val and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system means K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
the modules can be inv@@ oked via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call through the modules themselves .
since the modules are used by multiple applications together , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are tested only very little before you use them to use the demo database first before you apply them to your own pictures ; Demo data base can be accessed either using the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say , I wouldn &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are just a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order doesn &apos;t support , it sim@@ ulates for some modules the order after albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
this sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment .
apart from the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to hand over a list of albums . here , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you have set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums , for example , if you use the category people , will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so if you have selected people to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start a photo album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used from any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool bar at the top . under the toolbar you can see the window that you can browse your image database . in the section we will view this window , but now click on the picture below to show you an overview of all existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the people shown on the picture , where the image was taken , etc . you can either set any image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is m@@ apped and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all of these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer .
see three lists with a text box by speci@@ fying persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is to move the pictures within the list : if you have a family celebration , for example , and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can , by the fact that the names used are moved upwards , the persons can find and arrange them faster .
if you prefer to get an alphabetical sorted list , click on the symbol for sort by date on the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and have these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the right .
if you &apos;ve recorded several images , for example with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item several entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
on the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as a sub@@ group . to show you that it is a hyper@@ group , a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the catalogue , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it to a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this requires that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can shift the individual elements of the catalogue by clicking the bar , which form the top edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window from a frame by drag@@ ging it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button , which allows you to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to display this window later , use the button Options ... and then window one / hide . this can be seen in the picture .
if you select images in your browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images in case you have no filter . you can configure the thumb@@ nails , by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button . just try it .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this will appear in the picture viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the images you want to delete and press either the Del@@ ete key or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now the window appears that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in fact , you can also use the images without you having saved on your hard disk . of course you need to save the pictures somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all needed images can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is trun@@ cated , are not stored on the hard drive . however , the thumb@@ nails are present for pictures 5 @-@ 9 , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also preview these images with the picture viewer .
as you see , this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy it back . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance , such as the confusion of your images , please buy a larger hard disk to store all the images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name Privacy . if you want a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end of those you want to make available for others and click on Current View locked in the menu item privacy . alternatively , you can also control all the pictures that your little sister may see , control and un@@ lock the menu item All out of the current view .
with this you have set out which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item pictures , which will f@@ ade out all the images you have blocked . if you want to get the pictures back , click on lock .
it is also possible to set a password which must be entered for un@@ locking the images . to set up this password , simply change password in the menu item Privacy .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe . on the one hand , all images on the hard drive and on the other can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view of private images .
the reason you have all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with you to describe it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; over an image _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in . it shows , of course , the picture , but additional information you have entered on the picture , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where it was done , etc .
if the Info@@ box in the upper part of the image you want to see , you can easily drag it with the mouse and move elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer .
some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see the appropriate entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you load multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and picture down . you can jump to the first and last image with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as slideshow ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new picture can be controlled by pressing Ctr@@ l key and Plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it to be able to switch to full@@ screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you can use the viewer , you can drag and zoom into the picture . to zoom in , you can simply draw a rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse . using the Min@@ us button , you can zoom in . the plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rec@@ t@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the equal button the zoom takes , so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations work with videos that are in and out with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ ust@@ aste .
with the rotation functions from the context menu you can rot@@ ate the picture . this does not work with videos . you can comment on the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you will find an image with a person whose name you have forgotten on the image . at the moment you can view the view and open Con@@ figuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to select only the image and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you watch one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add images with features while you view them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by using the corresponding letters . in the picture you can see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have features on your images , these are available in your browser . so if you have all the images you want to edit , print or whatever you have selected , simply complete all the pictures you want . this is described in detail . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen . if you want to display categories in the preview screen , then you can add features to the images by simply press the letter for the attribute after selecting the image . this can be seen here :
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , you will be allowed to draw on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can reverse your painted later .
in order to see the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the image , select from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; you should definitely read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties and the object is shown in the wire @-@ mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , as all sub @-@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the location on which you want to insert the object and click the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Insert menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu appears , so that you can choose the right position :
you can delete selected objects from the scene with del@@ eting either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to accept these changes . if you have invalid values , a message is displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click on users or disc@@ ard the changes with Cancel .
when you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation in the Setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ Reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press Preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a sub@@ ordination item ( for example a texture within a texture Map and not the entire texture map ) , check locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the camera control points . you can drag these points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire @-@ model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a degree of visibility as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of sight of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects will only be displayed if selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the scene chosen in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as desired . you can also save several windows orders and simply change between different orders .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ t@@ angle then indicates the new position .
to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views over each other , drag the starter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card @-@ runner in the top of the views .
the last possible window alignment are floating views : views that are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to view a view from anch@@ oring , drag the starter to the desktop or click on the small pointing arrow pointing to the left .
to close a view click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer@@ ing bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor it anywhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the current window view can be saved with view window ordering ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dialog will appear where you can save the window ordering under an existing or new name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have created a scene you can render them ren@@ dern . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g for rendering , this program must be correct . when this manual was written , &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select the menu item View Tape .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View R@@ ender Mode menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense , but it is a name to detect the properties of the mode .
in the card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub @-@ section and enter the image editing to render into the input fields .
in combination field quality you can select the properties , the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refle@@ ctions . a detailed description of the render features can be found in the user &apos;s guide to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , various errors may arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step @-@ effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the representation . this effect is called Ali@@ asing .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of this error . generally pictures with this quality look better .
when you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling involves the adjacent pixels . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sively ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is split again and again and adap@@ tively because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixels are divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are followed individually and can be checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion allows you to set the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process , called j@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn on j@@ itter@@ ing , changes &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card tab you can set whether the alpha channels are to be comp@@ uted by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have not made an object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; scene file , select the menu entry File Import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet complete command of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; . when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you don &apos;t want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from the property tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; this adds the source text of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree .
copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . insert the path to your document and the version . the versions 3.@@ 1g and 3.5 are supported .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ t@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type identi@@ fier .
you can set the scope of the points to the Grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in more precise wire @-@ model and therefore better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
when you cross High Detailed Search for advanced proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided when the camera uses advanced projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this property provides a better approach for proj@@ ections , but requires more time for rendering .
if you indicate a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
if you indicate floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
when you tick the edge , the non @-@ recur@@ sive Anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . in the section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di you will find more detailed information about the parameters .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window orders , it explains how to create and store window orders .
the drop @-@ down box standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window man@@ ders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement using the button Rem@@ ove .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all the views for the selected window arrangement . you can create new views using the button Add and delete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
the position of the new window . with new column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a card @-@ card view together with the previous view and floating the view does not anchor in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more exact knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball at one level .
but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings before you compl@@ ain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window ordering :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation to get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete , so you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice this in the fourth wire model view ( right down ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the description of camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the View properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray , you will find further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position .
when you press the button App@@ ly or the Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a charger ( insert End Body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method of solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the layer in the property tree , change the name and then press the button App@@ ly or Enter . in the property tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ model view now also shows the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene ren@@ ders , the plane expands to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree exactly , you will notice that you can fold the entry for the floor when clicking on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should shift the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose Shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog where you can choose how to insert the object . please select First Sub@@ item . the pigment will then change in the property tree . you can change the name in the property tree ( name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the button Preview you see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the pig@@ ments preview only shows a matt black material because you have to re @-@ enter settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time by clicking on preview . now , there are many possibilities again , but now take the simpl@@ est .
if you see no color on the header and ball in the preview then click App@@ ly button and then call the Preview button .
the material for the floor is set right now . if you ren@@ ew your image with one click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , these are not the color ones you have expected . here are additional settings necessary . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called One Color . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select each time in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the properties :
you should already be able to do this step since you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as simple as the ground :
in view of the properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget the input button or button App@@ ly ) so that the ball has contact with the floor . otherwise the ball would float above the ground , as you have moved the floor to a unit down@@ wards .
of course , the rendering now results in a strange result : as before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , set a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as on the ground , give the sphere a pigment as color :
select First Sub@@ object and change the name for example in Pig@@ ment Pig@@ ment . click on the Pig@@ ment tab , then select Un@@ icol@@ oured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects when you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values like in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press Enter .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already partly result in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ ay@@ cing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you sh@@ y@@ trac@@ er a scene , the rendering of hypo@@ the@@ tical rays origin@@ ates from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog can affect . thus , the scene pixels are processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a storage space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ arded .
this menu item can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last executed command . this menu item can only be selected if you have used Ed@@ iting .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing layout .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cut and standard behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can modify or add new commands with this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can add and remove commands with this option tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to sim@@ ulate rough surfaces without having to model any b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both a b@@ ump map as well as for a texture Map .
basic elements are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from do@@ zens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a texture Map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base , using an image file as color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the picture or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; it is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display by clicking on &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or button Return .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can exit the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog box - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the working style of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , you can set the keyboard short@@ cut for the respective window .
if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
this point is activated , loads &amp; k@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still watch the current image . this reduces the delay if you select the next picture , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; k@@ ick@@ show ; when ending the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; k@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; k@@ ick@@ show ; set up only some of the file types that the program can also display .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is switched on as default .
specify whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change the keyboard short@@ cut for the different modes of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the card @-@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , you switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub @-@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
shows preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
the image is reduced by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
the image increases by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened anymore .
show the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the box for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ foto ; is part of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute his part to at least problems and possible improvements .
this displays a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and desires . if you are using it , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and desires . all information you need is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to report your message .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ foto , then we would like to answer you the user &apos;s mail@@ ing@@ list and hopefully soon answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ foto ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions to join the developer mailing list from &amp; show@@ foto ; .
&amp; show@@ foto ; tries to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that can change the behavior of &amp; show@@ foto ; to access these settings , you need to set up the Settings button in the Settings menu . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the range of exposure indicators you can select the color displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator was selected . the colors with what you are supposed to display should be in contrast . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and exposure of a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto ; has a side bar at the right edge that provides you with important information and actions for the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in the image editing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that do not make more than images to scan and save .
&amp; stream ; is a simple application for scanning images that can no longer scan and save images . &amp; stream ; can open a dialog for each image or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SAN@@ E project page by typ@@ ing the information on this page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set in a terminal at the command line . if this scanner can not be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to select the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel will end &amp; stream ; Cancel .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
to view an image , the user can start a preview scan and then scan the scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
if the image was selected then the final image can be read using the Scan button .
when pre@@ viewing a preview in the settings is selected , then the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and sle@@ y ? en leads to a demol@@ ition and you will get back to the main window .
the button settings dialog opens the dialog box in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be checked .
this setting allows them to select the way &amp; channels , saving images . open dialog for each image opens the dialog box in front of each scann@@ ed image . if &amp; stream , then you need to save them with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to choose saving without having to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved when saving without having to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog for saving . the default is your home directory and you can change it using the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically saved images and is beyond the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically stored image gets a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix of each time a picture is saved . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user can customize the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if Select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; manual . button Over starts the K@@ DE over -@@ Dialog for &amp; float ; . the button settings dialog displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end &amp; stream .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like any other keyboard short@@ cut . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cut can be set by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and set the Global button short@@ cut to set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and set up short commands .
you may set up existing multimedia keys so they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Short@@ cuts work . by doing so , you make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de command line options ; additionally , Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use dialog to allow the user to know why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; , which each K@@ DE installation should be included .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow remote programs and commands to execute . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure We@@ is the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work@@ load folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
tr@@ ack@@ Change Sign@@ alizing that a new piece is played . the script could now ask &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions for more information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the unit length ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Menu@@ Cli@@ cked : sub @-@ menu it@@ em@@ Number paths lists the path to the selected playlist files when a custom menu item is cli@@ cked . to remove the menu item , you can use D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ ame ) . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ ame ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to perform e.g. cleaning operations . this includes storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script pack@@ ets that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name like e.g. my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ amar@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly see the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with the extension of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages properly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script box is ready , you can attach it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the W@@ iki Scrip@@ ts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; hang . for your entry on k@@ de apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; script .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re just looking for a certain title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you will find it within seconds with &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s collection browser and quick search .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just the right thing for you . and if you still find it hard , select dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many gen@@ eric USB devices . also , many different audio systems can be used , so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . this and many other useful features make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to re@@ discover your music !
usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources you have to enter the folder to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report these in the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Requirements section .
activ@@ ates Deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort over the setup dialog . the Setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
player window displays the player window in addition to the playlist . if the option is switched off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar was compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok is compiled ; it has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this changes the used color scheme for the tuning bar@@ ometer .
storing voice files in the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok is compiled ; if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok are stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is needed .
other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
save Play@@ list to save , save the current playlist automatically when ending &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist while moving .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date sli@@ ce can be seen visible when changing the play@@ lists window in order to keep the current piece always in the visible window area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when changing the context @-@ browser , the context @-@ browser automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ad@@ dress section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok . by selecting Custom Writ@@ ings , the otherwise gray section is enabled . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browser . click Select ... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and you can set a separate color scheme . use the selected color selection for fore@@ ground and background color .
play back when starting , causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start , playback automatically starts with the piece at the place , with which it was stopped at the last stop .
set up the screen on @-@ screen display allows you to turn the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD will appear and you can directly view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
use your own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color faces opens the dialog for color selection . if its own colors are not enabled , the default &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the display text input text displays the text shown in the O@@ SD . by typ@@ ing plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your needs . below is a list of available wild@@ cards and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multiple monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop down box . some drivers enable even more settings in this card tab .
the card collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains the check boxes to set how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse the sub @-@ folder recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the ti@@ led and their sub @-@ folders to browse through music .
monitor changes : allow &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import playlist : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collections folder ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) add to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists later appear in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : allows you to choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , there is still additional setup in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ ql setup .
the My@@ S@@ ql device section is used for setting up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : the machine where the My@@ S@@ ql database is located . then it is entered in port : the network port under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Pass@@ word : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; load .fm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; card is the support for last@@ .fm . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .fm server and create music recommendations on the current piece as needed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .fm profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .fm website .
send down played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting enables you to transmit the name of played pieces to your last@@ .fm profile .
invoke similar interpre@@ ters : after activ@@ ating this setting , call &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the each played piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .fm profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a little guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some features such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager stops the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , as these provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the tag@@ lib developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang the broken file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and let the collection again be created .
most of the time , this is because Tag@@ lib cr@@ ashes with reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the tag@@ lib developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
ensure that all libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , or Amar@@ ok , compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , tag@@ lib but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to cr@@ ashes when editing the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate autom@@ . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least use no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open to a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but these are not known as Unic@@ ode . the following per@@ l script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l die &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; $ mp@@ 3 &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repet@@ ition / dynamic playlist ) see K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects will be easily forgotten .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check whether Amar@@ ok is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
most installation problems are best explained by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please bear only one mistake , if you have something about the removal of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , only a blank playlist appears . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start sub @-@ window was converted to the statistics window . you will find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the rating by the user , while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist . click the title bar of the playlist and select column Show evaluation . click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for one piece . you can also use the Short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From playlist removed from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and drop them there , just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , next to the Add button , the button Play@@ list is located . click on it .
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question needs loud world media types supports G@@ asp@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support virtually any only concei@@ vable audio format . G@@ Stream@@ er can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it can ! maybe you are using F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which does not include MP3 decoder in default ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input button
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stream@@ er driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and deliver simultaneously audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. s@@ b@@ live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the problem of problem and a solution . for G@@ Stream@@ er you may need to specify a different link ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . G@@ Stream@@ er is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stream@@ er reads the file , de@@ code them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS enco@@ des the data first . G@@ Stream@@ er can print directly to AL@@ SA , just as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stream@@ er driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open the control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . activate the sound server with highest priority ( real@@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next item of the FAQ ! ) . ensure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per su@@ id is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause dist@@ orted playback . read this bug report . to enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA configuration file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stream@@ er or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less day@@ time the visu@@ aliz@@ ations react . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ Stream@@ er driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ?
after installing G@@ Stream@@ er , you need to register all components . run g@@ st register to register all of the G@@ Stream@@ er components .
read the G@@ Stream@@ er FAQ . if this does not help you can also ask the I@@ RC channel # g@@ asp@@ amer .
try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run g@@ st register , once as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with g@@ st @-@ config / g@@ asp@@ amer @-@ config ) and run g@@ st register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if you have a whole list of suggestions , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will have arous@@ ed by the gentle sounds of the music that you stopped prior to bed .
how to get the current name &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running tracks when you &apos;re on a different computer ?
if a working SS@@ H environment exists , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpre@@ ter and title of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable Amar@@ ok player now@@ Play@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is in the file ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa .
visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; windows are separated . push on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the combination of Ctr@@ l + Right mouse button puts a piece in the queu@@ e sequence into the queu@@ e . pressing the input button after searching in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search returns .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers should be displayed .
my personal folder $ HOME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and on the console many error messages appear . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on the audio CD in the menu . to the normal read , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic enco@@ ding , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , Per@@ cent@@ age FRO@@ M statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escape e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ;
basically this adap@@ ts the previous review with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece has been played . the more often the piece has been played , the less influence has any individual evaluation on the overall result .
you can enter the evaluation for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column header in the play@@ lists window . then you can change the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece , selecting : rating or pressing F2 . you can also edit the rating in the Metad@@ ata dialog .
the developers do not want to tell you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not associated with the short term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find anno@@ ying . disable the option icon when playing in the General Settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . choose Settings Tool@@ bars setup ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... Visual context browser design , click New Design install ....
the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ quest@@ .com ) too similar . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation range allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing the Kon@@ quer@@ or , start the Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click on the Settings button and select Amar@@ ok .
Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , then please the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of cr@@ ashes and therefore also a lot of error reports .
probably , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ asp@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you must configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
probably you use a distribution that is installing the development files separated from the actual program . although G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , the necessary development files are missing . you must now install the package g@@ asp@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same goes for x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you have to re@@ compile and install Amar@@ ok again .
I receive the error G@@ Stream@@ er @-@ Crit@@ ical * * : factory for &apos; adder &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stream@@ er was compiled with Pre@@ linking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stream@@ er . you need to compile G@@ Stream@@ er without pre@@ linking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : don &apos;t use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ asp@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stream@@ er , next to g@@ asp@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad , the module g@@ asp@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time must be installed .
you get the bug there is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the g@@ asp@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run it as a system administrator , then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
set up Amar@@ ok Settings ... Audio output type the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second one .
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
in the x@@ ine setup dialog now enter us@@ b @-@ audio and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick in the sound@@ card supports m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be looked after . you may , of course , be happy to take this problem by yourself ! if you want , you can get the new so much @-@ needed assistant for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there are the orientation wiz@@ ard that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok . if you want to upgrade your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wiz@@ ard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
the small text field to filter the collection makes it easy for you to search for certain pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , the tree view will immediately save the remaining appropriate entries . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the Play@@ list button . you will find this button in the toolbar of the Play@@ list window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have the option to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . with a right @-@ click on a playlist , you &apos;ll find different ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please select an audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD @-@ pieces in WAV format . just drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the button back .
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the Burn function is also available in the playlist . just click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the Burn menu . you have different options for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; pre@@ supp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally , some additional packages are listed which make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable .
if you install these packages through a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok , a player window with the most important features . additionally , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including the creation of a collection and a playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a running text display , which shows the currently running piece or the current stream . directly below it is the area , the play time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current play . a click on this section changes the display of the already exp@@ ired play time for the remaining time of play .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch from the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the pane .
die &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
under the running text display , the kno@@ bs PL and E@@ Q . the kno@@ b PL enables or de@@ activ@@ ates the Play@@ list window while the E@@ Q button is used to set E@@ quali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to set the play position or volume . with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or last piece .
the use of the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the box E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that do not exist in any other player , but don &apos;t let yourself be deter@@ red by the abundance of functions , they are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left hand side is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right hand side is the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use , yet even for advanced users power strong enough .
the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the each running piece . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ter . these three sub @-@ windows will later appear in detail . they provide information about the current piece on each of the different aspects .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub@@ window will drop off . the information presented there are now split into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information can be viewed in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpre@@ ter and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window shows information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , interpre@@ ter and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to play the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you can find more information about the current play under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . you can see here how often and when the piece has been played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to view cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the images may have arbitr@@ ary names , but pictures with the word front in the name are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next area , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the pieces of Recommen@@ ded pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpre@@ ter . this section shows the five highest scores of the current interpre@@ ter .
you can set what information to display in the music sub@@ window . right click anywhere in the sub @-@ window and select from the context menu .
the last area , albums of the interpre@@ ter , lists all albums of the current interpre@@ ter , which you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click the right mouse button on it and then select one of the ways to add the piece or album to the playlist .
in the sub@@ window text , the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . once you click on the text under@@ window , try &amp; download the text for the piece from the Internet . if there is no text script running , you can choose which should be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s collection database . no running text script is required .
the search button opens a search on Goo@@ g@@ le.com after the lyrics for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing interpre@@ t - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpre@@ ter . albums or gen@@ res are ignored .
group@@ ing artist / album - first the pieces are arranged according to interpre@@ t and there will be another split after the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various Artists .
group@@ ing artist / year - album - S@@ orted by interpre@@ t and then after the year of the album in desc@@ ending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the interpre@@ ter will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpre@@ t - your pieces are first sorted by genre , and among them by interpre@@ t .
group@@ ing genre / interpre@@ t / album - this setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpre@@ ter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize the group@@ ing at will and combine them .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you have something on the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this could take a while .
right under the toolbar , there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual .
below the search filter is a selection field , with which help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time windows , from the last 24 hours to a year . you can also select your complete collection , which makes the filter practically switched off .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following options .
load - Emp@@ ty the current playlist and add the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
attach to the playlist - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect .
set pieces in queu@@ e - This function adds the selected pieces to the queu@@ e . this will be played next .
save as Play@@ list ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name to save the list .
transfer to Media Player - Ad@@ ds the pieces in the queu@@ e to transfer to the Media Player . see the Media Player Browser section for more details .
burn all pieces of this interpre@@ ter / burn on CD - Th@@ rough the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) Move files to the du@@ st@@ bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as a compilation - select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among other interpre@@ ters .
the album will then no longer be displayed among other performers but again under the corresponding interpre@@ ter .
the play@@ lists browsers are easy to handle with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that has never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click the Intelligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist . there you can enter all the required criteria for your new playlist .
the sub @-@ window media player is used to connect &amp; Amar@@ ok with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , it must be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to interpre@@ t sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them to the list interpre@@ t . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . thus , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transfer is completed , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and release the drive connection for your iPod .
under the toolbar you find a search area with which you can search for a file . search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because all files are hidden in the file list that do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is a address bar where you can pick music from a given URL . for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z input and press Enter key , you can access music from the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult due to simple case dro@@ pping . in that case the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically include dropped files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired location . as soon as you enter letters , only the pieces containing the letters are displayed , which contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter separate search terms by whit@@ esp@@ ace , search &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . if you enter , for example , one in two , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter between the search terms OR , search for entries which contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries , contain the spaces , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries , which include Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a certain search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variants at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this is looking for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment bath .
you can set the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctr@@ l key , and then click the right mouse button in the desired sequence on the entries . the entries then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left hand side you will find the button Add to add to the playlist . to the right you will find Play@@ list Save , Play@@ list Emp@@ ty and Ac@@ cep@@ tible M@@ ischen .
next , the buttons follow undo and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar , there is a unique , magni@@ fying analy@@ zer . the ref@@ resh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you get in the player window via the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s configuration setup .
there are many more available buttons for toolbar , for example playback controls and volume control . you can set the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total game time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and playback is displayed . the status of random mode and playback can be easily changed by double clicking in the corresponding display area using the mouse .
you can also hide the status bar by de@@ activ@@ ating the status bar in the General Settings .
the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu .
one click on this entry opens the visu@@ alization plugin window . there you can select the visu@@ alis@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry you will find a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool to manage your cover images . you can start them by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpre@@ ter in your collection by selecting the interpre@@ ter on the left side .
with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select from :
the queu@@ e administration received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece into the queu@@ e , a number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will be played : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queu@@ e , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces using the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queu@@ e administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ set ( the details to set up these later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces while playing .
adds pieces based on Last@@ .fm &apos;s recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces already are in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .fm profile so that this dynamic playlist works .
double click on the playlist you want to drag , drag it to the playlist window or click the Load button . in this way your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances !
the two pre@@ set modes and play@@ lists mix immediately complete your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist Recommen@@ ded pieces starts with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece even from your collection . the recommended pieces are added to the next batch change , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . using the same menu item , dynamic mode can also be disabled again .
the New button re@@ plen@@ ishes the current playlist and adds new pieces according to dynamic mode . Play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog will open to edit the playlist settings .
enter here any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for coming pieces is ski@@ pped and you will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the pieces already played will be removed under consideration of the set @-@ up pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist . thus you can easily see which pieces were played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed .
the Settings on the right page has already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross several play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the linked play@@ lists .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by launching the script and then clicking on .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok scripts , by clicking on the script . a selection dialog will open in which a script package to install . after you have installed the script , a new entry will be added to the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . select the script to delete , then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to the section Write Scrip@@ ts .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug@@ ins are used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin , simply enable the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start will show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have a se@@ wn installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ s@@ less compressed formats then remember that when you re @-@ enco@@ ding MP3 , you can get a worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD is created by a los@@ s@@ less format .
in this dialog box , you can do nothing . please wait until the calcul@@ ator has finished the burning process .
this Quick Start will show you how to copy a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have a se@@ wn installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , CD ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog that looks like this :
in this dialog box , you can track the progress of the copy process . once the read of the original is completed in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium on which the data should be burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burn the image file . you need to wait until the overall progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burn the image file . you need to wait until the overall progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T designer tool U@@ IC can not find the K@@ D@@ ED@@ IR@@ S / lib / k@@ de@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ D@@ ED@@ IR@@ S through your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org . there you can get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback from the forums and get news on Community help .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program bur@@ ns audio or data CD R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burn all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the features that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; offers , and expands these functions even . therefore choose &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality in burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet , such programs are generally called ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio enco@@ ding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis de@@ oder@@ - and enco@@ der modules .
mad : this is a high quality MPEG audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 Enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them onto an audio CD .
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio Enco@@ der module .
Trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a fully featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assemb@@ ling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . it can , for example , be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the various albums can lead to the un@@ happy effect that the music pieces are played differently according to the music .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ load recently opened projects . the accompanying sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save under will be shown to select folder and file name for the project file .
stores all opened projects . this is the same as if you would like to save file saving for each project .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each non @-@ recorded project what will happen , just as if you were called for each project file .
includes all opened projects and termin@@ ated &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each non @-@ stored project it is asked what will happen , as if you had inv@@ oked file closing .
when you visit this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the pop @-@ up dialog . this has the same effect as if you are entering the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the so added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialog box for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button Burn , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened when the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described via the What is this ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is intended for you rather than help , so that you can see the files and folders already existing on the medium .
this entry only appears when an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function remo@@ ves no files from the medium , it only blin@@ ds the previously imported files .
opens the CD Copy dialog . alternatively , you can create a CD &apos;s copy to another medium . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD that you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should also prefer cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
alternatively , you can also create a copy of a DVD that you can burn later later . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a DVD that you can then burn later . furthermore , the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the typ@@ o modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , you need to use other tools such as No@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button .
a previously read DVD video can be converted . this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the selected video , coding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black mar@@ gins .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the table of contents and includes properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is checked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is checked , their contents are displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as Media Info , Lock and Un@@ locking the drive or ej@@ ection of the media .
the Table of Table refers to selecting and drag@@ ging files into the project view . the table of contents is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD has been selected in the folder view .
the header is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header bar has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box for changing the key assign@@ ments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the assign@@ ments for it further down .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wiz@@ ard . thus , the correct per@@ missions can be set for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wiz@@ ard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on h@@ ie@@ b . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and to fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical to the functionality , therefore more your taste and the type of your task is decisive , which of the two programs give you the default .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to be able to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then give something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , which have all the &amp; k@@ de ; program common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts that are described below .
the Standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects .

as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Alternati@@ vely you can create a project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above @-@ listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String flags ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String array ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
with this , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts the files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / some@@ fil@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; a reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on the enco@@ der that is installed on the machine .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and from many enco@@ ders that en@@ code these wa@@ v files ( compressed ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) are supported by default ( this enco@@ der packages must be added from the Linux distribution ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and saved to WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed to the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or even in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is probably not necessary to compile something yourself . however , only the enco@@ der packages must be installed , which are needed . if , for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which enco@@ der / file format is to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device fails to cover the protection , it is not possible to use a protected audio CD ; in any case &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; even do not avoid the mechanism of copy protection .
while the setup needs to be done only once ( the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , a daily approach to reading a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface that you &apos;ll often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of commands of the main window . on the page step by step example you find more information on how to use this program as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the setup of In@@ quiry in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case must first be connected to the Internet . )
start reading and - if a enco@@ der is configured in the enco@@ ding settings tab in the Setup dialog - the enco@@ ding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection with a different enco@@ der can be read as the standard . it should be noted that previously the enco@@ der in the enco@@ ding settings tab was configured in the Setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already read @-@ out file is selected to code instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the Setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , pie@@ p@@ ses ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( like enco@@ ders , to set the enco@@ der ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression rates and helps you choose the right enco@@ der .
if no audio information is lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; mon@@ key &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important since both enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license issues
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets is present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB Stick , Memory card , HDD ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - in the beginning of 2009 , these devices mostly support only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate approx . 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car radio systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated to most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information retri@@ eved manually or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . they can be passed / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the enco@@ ding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with enco@@ ding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameter by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; added . the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button designation in the wiz@@ ard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs , which can download information instead of typ@@ ing itself into the calcul@@ ator instead . it is worth not@@ ing that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( the author intended ) am not attor@@ ney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information that is publicly available on the &amp; CD ; no more or less valuable , so neither the artist nor the music company can be inf@@ licted . all information can be obtained from a bum@@ ble through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ ev@@ ing data from the server ( This may only know the program@@ mer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the geograph@@ ically closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and compar@@ es the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which read@@ out program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. please note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed first if this is not yet done .
for storing the selected wa@@ v files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed by the respective Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined enco@@ der . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about its switches using a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . you must replace &apos; l@@ ame &apos; by the name of the installed enco@@ der .
this can have many causes . check the setup of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read just and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envel@@ ope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you are using other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example we will start the program for the first time , setup everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 search keywords ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example using a search engine as it is considered not entirely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have read access ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it with the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something which is probably only once done and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each &amp; CD ;
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them with each reading of a &amp; CD , once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the read@@ out program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ Data / pieces can be read .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of device design@@ ations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card tab General Settings . here there is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be as left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
just select In@@ clu@@ de in@@ complete information so that you will be informed when details of generating keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the card label CD ; settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second drop @-@ down box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the result@@ ant directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory name and file name will be changed easily with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , please note : if you want to manually enter everything manually , please de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , this is about 620 MB large , consider this twice if this is worth it . to fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card tab .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data query , for retri@@ ev@@ ing the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the fre@@ ed@@ b section .
mode : we did not download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equally as far as the server is concerned , as many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to transfer data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box .
simply take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the / tmp folder exists on your computer )
number simultaneously reading pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , so simply try himself .
CD ; check out after reading the last piece : check this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files are created in the private folder . if you do not forget this folder , if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files yourself .
all the same as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a little long , under certain circumstances something must be fed to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3s . as mentioned earlier , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; to restri@@ ct the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ding WAV files : with a dual @-@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can attempt to en@@ code more than one wa@@ v file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section and set up . first , a connection to the Internet is constructed , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b will be set up . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data saved for a &amp; CD ; with success from fre@@ ed@@ b data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually insert instead of retri@@ ev@@ ing them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , then the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length in the window should be listed as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only if the CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , then search for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section on the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all the titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; a window will pop up and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also manually rede@@ em it by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; current title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the bottom commentary box can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor , so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words start with upper@@ case letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the commentary box . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help to the enco@@ der to get more information .
for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap can be found under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you entered all title data of the &amp; CD .
note : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list .
note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or off . make sure that all pieces are selected , or click the All pieces selected at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
when clicking on the button selection read the read process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what happens .
click on the tab job to turn on the order window . it is in the upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left bottom of the window in the status line .
this error message appears when you try to work with a enco@@ der that you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successfully co@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the job list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we entered here in the example . did you check if you have typ@@ ing access to the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the job 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the enco@@ ding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . in case of low @-@ performance machines , the result is un@@ clear . the computer used with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and enco@@ ding ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is placed in the queu@@ e of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message will be displayed in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . bz@@ w . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is maintained today within the C@@ k@@ de ; CV@@ S as part of the k@@ dem@@ ulti@@ media package . however , most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is aimed at persons who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program can be customized to suit your needs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step for example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the various map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hello , still reading it ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first @-@ time start of the program , without any reference point as it should go on from this empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program boot ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , may it do . at least only after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agre@@ es with this proposal .
cur@@ i@@ ously if you succeeded in getting the source file of the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; in addition to others , he has with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke ring high@@ lighting of texts also some features that others &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also work . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound proj@@ ector required for G@@ US cards .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( son@@ g@@ ons or tex@@ tual events ) . k@@ mid will automatically retri@@ eve the process used .
session support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during playback of a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
you can also create a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button to play in the toolbar , select the play from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece starts automatically as soon as you draw it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( for several pieces they are added to a collection and then played succ@@ essi@@ vely . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the kno@@ b .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows left and right of the tempo display and thus change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu item pause in the menu item , thus inter@@ rup@@ ts the playback . press the space key while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use texture , others use song events and others both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set what events are to be presented and even better : the event type will be automatically retri@@ eved , which uses a song so you don &apos;t have to manually adjust the kar@@ aoke text . you still have the option to change it if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set an event type , select from the Settings menu item settings or property events . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summar@@ ize . these are played after the series . in this section , you &apos;ll find how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , open the collection manager first . you will find it in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ izer . click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired items in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . remember when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song using the button Add a song . this again appears the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic addition to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece of opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) is automatically added to the active collection .
if automatic add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when a piece is opened . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series after the sub @-@ menu sequence of the men@@ ue collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be specified .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to ski@@ p a song , select the Next song button , the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back to a song , select the previous piece button , the previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesi@@ zers that are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events translate into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ Map that conver@@ ts all the events of the Typ@@ s Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and therefore always sound a trumpet when a piano was originally supposed to play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required implement@@ ations for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different tex@@ ti@@ d ( see below ) .
De@@ fine PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... END De@@ fine key@@ map &quot; Name of key@@ map ... &quot; END De@@ fine key@@ map &quot; One more key@@ map ... &quot; END De@@ fine CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... END OP@@ TION@@ S ... END
you see that De@@ fine is used to indicate that a section begins ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and END that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email , so that I can offer &amp; k@@ mid support in future versions ; support can be for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section you specify how the Patches of General MIDI can be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general usage looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s To M is needed to put all the sounds that this instrument needs to note on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard for example does not support a gun shot ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun shot . to do this , you can use the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is the term &apos; Drum @-@ patch &apos; of the patch , in which every note represents another per@@ c@@ ussi@@ onist instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds are shown on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
as with PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to display sounds on the percussion channel . see for example the key@@ maps included .
this section can be used to form some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , you can simply do it in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( general MIDI to channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel which is shown on the N channel . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be used with the name Name for this channel . the corresponding key@@ map must , of course , be further defined in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored that will try to change the patch on this channel .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the per@@ c@@ ussions @-@ patch on the percussion channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio speci@@ fies in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ b@@ ender event with the value n , this is converted to the formula n * ( r / 4@@ 096 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 4@@ 096 is used to be no dec@@ imal com@@ mas in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM adm@@ its that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch @-@ b@@ ender event with the value 4@@ 096 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards will try to play two notes up to one oc@@ t@@ ave . in order to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI @-@ Map , simply open the dialog for MIDI settings . you can find it in the menu under Settings , Point of MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these keyboard you see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button illumin@@ ates no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( up to now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . in the View menu , select View on the View Channel View : settings
the tempo LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc , so that the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a bin@@ ary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
accept , support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . just open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
previously , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; working area a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a kar@@ aoke file ) or stap@@ led ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or I want to play a file only in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you just want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection , turn off Automatic Ad@@ ding to the collection , and the new file will add to the temporary collection . opening files
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so set the setting of Automatic Ad@@ ding to the Collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid , and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , I encourage me to continue to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ J@@ im@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much spare time for my hob@@ bies but I try to take a bit of time . as a hobby , I have programming , MIDI files collecting , making music and pro@@ ving pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where they can download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid , or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ ket@@ .@@ es
you really make me a big pleasure if you send me a postcard from your place or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all that send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I &apos;ll be among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file already .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and won &apos;t get money from anybody for it . I would like to empha@@ size that I &apos;m just getting more programm@@ ere because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Beh@@ ind the defect that the pitch of A@@ WE cards was too high .
thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the A@@ WE support , Mr. Pet@@ ter Bi@@ eker , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Peter Gr@@ itsch , Magn@@ us Pfeffer , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error notification or even a suppor@@ tive email .
and of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid can be found on his homepage , which is located under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ ver@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and view images . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc .
a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same if you use a FM radio or an A@@ WE map .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not hear any music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , ph@@ ono and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as DVD s , VCD , or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help please check the The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user M@@ ailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ cur@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only appear when information is displayed .
it is possible to store the preferred links below the Bookmarks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Sustainable Play@@ list .
of course you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hier@@ archy . if you balance an entry , his group and all sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the added entry .
the categories &apos; Current piece &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running through an editor , but also through the application itself . simply click on a name of a category to select from the menu view and next edit mode . by clicking a sub @-@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you need to select from the drop @-@ down menu with a playlist and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation when starting and loading can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and change &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at the start doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be anno@@ ying at the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation may be ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ gement &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / s ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ;
there is a tab for the configuration of M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player . here the path from the M@@ Player and the clip@@ board size of the data stream can be set from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool bar of KM@@ Player . here the output of m@@ player is visible .
there is no tab for this rend@@ ition in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , just like setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &quot; flash &quot; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; even the special field em@@ bed for YouTube can be inserted in the playlist XML .
so that the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can be reproduced in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the Setup dialog .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is to run in a con@@ soles application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there is no error , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
in order to always use a pre@@ set back@@ end for a certain m@@ ime type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; KM@@ Player ; can play by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the scanner can be used and the TV channels can be used . this can be used to edit the scanner from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing V@@ DR ( video data recor@@ ders ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in the settings is under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports selected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b contained in it .
since the V@@ DR support of S@@ ME@@ s can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of Video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . therefore , the following must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally , KM@@ Player is used for sources different names . at the time of creating this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source .
are there references like I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be executed as user root after mounting the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom is pointing to the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU have to be tested for its performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ hol@@ d. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is required for comp@@ iling &amp; K@@ ile ;
l@@ atex ; : a professional font application . under Unix @-@ like systems probably relies on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; res@@ p . &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be used .
the &amp; K@@ ile ; -@@ Project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; K@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . they allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included in the K@@ ile ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; l@@ atex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; K@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users probably don &apos;t have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the K@@ ile ; website .
questions about or when comp@@ iling &amp; K@@ ile ; on or if expan@@ sions are required , this should be addressed on the K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list .
&amp; K@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; work area . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; l@@ atex ; programs . in addition , &amp; K@@ ile ; the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; l@@ atex ; reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; function ; and to experience its possibilities , the manual should be used to K@@ ate . users of &amp; K@@ ile can start working directly with the reading of the chapter works with the editor .
for &amp; l@@ atex ; is the right outlet : lay @-@ TECH . turning the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use can also use a la@@ ie ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros . a less demanding but realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
here only a good overview of &amp; l@@ atex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to be able to rule , good books , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; l@@ atex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
just as other mark@@ ings include &amp; l@@ atex ; an introduction with which the general properties such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text green can be specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the quick @-@ entry assistant of &amp; K@@ ile ; is a useful function for quick creation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( menu ) provides some possibilities for the creation of the document . you can also modify some settings related to the document .
document classes : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , cover &#91; letter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
enco@@ ding : the enco@@ ding of the system is set . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; l@@ atex ; for inclusion , they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is just a short description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section .
&amp; K@@ ile ; it offers - just like other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; K@@ ile ; it is very likely that any mathematical environment is not closed .
the automatic digest@@ ion of the environment is generated by typ@@ ing a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank line ( for the input of the text ) and the corresponding line to the queu@@ e ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu settings K@@ ile ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; allows the document sub@@ division into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ section of the item ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective object .
when creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful when creating your own &amp; l@@ atex file . as soon as a DVI ; file is created , navig@@ ates &amp; K@@ ile ; by one click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding row in the l@@ atex ; source text .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as font and is besides PDF the commercial output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the return search , the elements of the DVI ; file are kno@@ cked with the editor and as soon as the element is cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file , the code search is the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in the l@@ atex ; source text was cli@@ cked , the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer is pressed .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document working with other embedded .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set about project project settings .
quick @-@ build : the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
file Monitoring : in this mode the DVI ; file to be increased n@@ der@@ ungen@@ â ¬ tiv@@ â ¼ ber@@ wach@@ t@@ â ¢ teau itself and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; after quick construction .
when viewing the Edit toolbar , the three large selection boxes should be stri@@ pped . the selection boxes were designed for quick merge of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for quick breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ itable &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are :
the choice field is available for items such as keywords , gro@@ unding notes or references . the available options are :
name : this command creates a name for a paragraph , an image or other element .
reference : is used for reference to a specified term ( choice of a selection field possible ) .
when using quote , a selection list is displayed with literary mer@@ ges . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file becomes a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are necessary editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; K@@ ile ; from hand .
the last selection box named Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã particulier e is used for the definition of the font size . it enables the font gre@@ ases to be set for the main text , the joints , etc .
when calling &amp; K@@ ile ; two choices are available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and defining the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch by hand .
the brackets after the command \ \ program class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font size . if the font size is not set at the beginning , this can also happen later in the text .
once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code must be compiled . the simpl@@ est way to do this is the use of the menu bau@@ chery or the button fast construction .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; K@@ ile ; exec@@ utes the storage automatically .
suggest comp@@ iling of the document , should be sought in logging in accordance with the faul@@ ts . when using quick @-@ mounting , &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text that is otherwise treated as the remaining document . for example , a report with the font gre@@ ases are created 12 and only a few columns are supposed to have another font size . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ bra and \ \ end { environment } is thus possible to change the font gre@@ ens within the environment .
the changes are super@@ vised only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . for example , you can add certain fon@@ ts , gre@@ ase pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions etc . these commands end either using the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { asc@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ic pressure and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { contempl@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in one sentence can be displayed ital@@ sively with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quot@@ a : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background to write the source text with the &amp; l@@ atex ; mark@@ up language , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; K@@ ile is now followed .
once a little text was entered in the wiz@@ ard , a few adjustments should be done for the better read@@ ability of the document . for this , min@@ d. a quote , a few places in bold and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem are to be applied to see the differences of these commands .
once the document is viewed , the Editor @-@ View or Ctr@@ l E can be returned to the Editor ( in the internal viewer ) . the window must be closed with an external viewer .
once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try out and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - looking after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed by file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file was created from the l@@ atex ; source text , the conversion can start into desired other formats using the buttons in the toolbar .
the default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; K@@ ile ; provides a suitable setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ Bin@@ Ã ¤ r@@ files . just Modern under settings K@@ ile must set up ... Tools Bauen balanced .
in order to check the default search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and will be cli@@ cked as@@ le@@ ep on default search . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer takes place immediately .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ Document of &amp; K@@ ile ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; K@@ ile ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; as text editor ( setup ey@@ ep@@ iece setup ... Editor )
if using the fast @-@ fitting of the &amp; DVI ; viewer cannot open , an error can occur . if an error occurs , this is displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the log file explains the error source in the source text . in the editor you can then use the buttons Pre@@ vious La@@ Te@@ X error and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X error for j@@ umps between errors . the log file always gives the line where the error appears . in order to view the incorrect line , the error in the log file must be cli@@ cked and &amp; K@@ ile ; j@@ umps to the def@@ ective line .
when clicking on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when choosing a blank document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wiz@@ ard will be used to quickly create a new document . further information is included in the section .
hands @-@ on users of &amp; l@@ atex ; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; K@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings will be subst@@ ituted by other data ( e.g. name or string enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set up in settings K@@ ile ... Settings can be set .
when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MENT@@ CLA@@ SSO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typ@@ ing in a document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MENT@@ CLA@@ SSO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
the simpl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and the associated input of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be completed :
when creating a new document , your own template can be selected instead of the default ones .
a template can be created from any &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be created . if a simple way to create a template , it should be searched for on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; K@@ ile ; used &amp; works ; as an internal editor . &amp; works ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( among them also &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings can be done directly from &amp; K@@ ile ; can be made out .
to learn more about &amp; operate ; and to experience its possibilities , the manual should be used to K@@ ate . users of &amp; K@@ ile can start working directly with the reading of the chapter works with the editor .
&amp; K@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; command reference which can be called for the Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands , which can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; can be used as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed Ctr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way clicking the \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when drag@@ ging the text with a left mouse button , the selected text will be copied to the clip@@ board automatically .
when using the arrow keys with penet@@ rated Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; K@@ ile ; has the possibility to search the most different kinds of source code and highlight these . for example , the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by a different color .
many wiz@@ ards can include additional j@@ umps . this is a separate type of book@@ marks inside the text . the menu entries , editing marks or the corresponding keyboard short@@ cuts the jump to the next or last j@@ umps mark .
the editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; K@@ ile ; . although &amp; works ; already excellent possibilities offered , have been added in &amp; K@@ ile ; key functions for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; speci@@ fies always lots of environments and groups and therefore support &amp; K@@ ile ; special commands for their selection . under Edit select the following commands for selecting a text :
W@@ Ã ¤ h@@ lt generates a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include a text with continuous lines ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code .
W@@ Ã ¤ h@@ lt the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , because this command also l@@ atex ; -@@ commands with a back@@ pack ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to the end of a part of the document , of course it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers the key Ctr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers with own commands here for a quicker possibility . under Edit Rem@@ ove are the following commands to delete the text :
remo@@ ves a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; K@@ ile ; is contained in the description to edit paragraph paragraph .
it has already been illustrated that environments play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; therefore &amp; K@@ ile ; for further commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with &amp; l@@ atex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cursor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , the overview can be lost quickly . this command closes the last changed environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; K@@ ile ; also provides special commands for &amp; l@@ atex ; groups that are determined by br@@ aces { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from editing environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right in front of the shar@@ pen@@ ed clamp .
with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ led cl@@ asp .
if the cursor is in front of or behind the br@@ aces of a &amp; tex ; group # it will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many welded clust@@ ers , the overview can quickly be lost . this command closes the last group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be confused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; l@@ atex ; two simple instructions are used as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gÃ ¼ n@@ se@@ fÃ ¼ s@@ schen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; for the purpose implementation is used in &amp; K@@ ile ; the sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used for two simple instructions is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; knows this case and leads two sleeping marks for &amp; l@@ atex ; one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this automatic setup of the double quotes can be set up under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and off .
you can also use custom settings ( e.g. n@@ english or french ) and therefore German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift ; input button for &amp; K@@ ile ; an intelligent line break . if the current position within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is , fÃ ¼ r &amp; K@@ ile ; not just a line break , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a sp@@ read@@ sheet environment , drag &amp; K@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a complete line break .
even better - &amp; K@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre@@ set &amp; l@@ atex ; - or custom environments . these can be done under settings K@@ ile ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X are added .
some users want to assign the columns in tables -@@ surroundings and thereby all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . drag &amp; K@@ ile ; after the next tab in the above line . even though this tab is not the one @-@ to @-@ one , add &amp; K@@ ile ; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tab@@ ulator .
although &amp; original ; already providing a good source code completion , this was added in &amp; K@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; l@@ atex ; ) , it has been added to different modes . all these modes can be configured for different working modes under settings K@@ ile ... are dis@@ continued .
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { Environment } , then &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { Environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and , unfortunately , the list will be gre@@ ased . on the other hand , the list may also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed by selecting a command . alternatively , jump stamps can be inserted , so that a simple jump to these positions is possible by editing br@@ anding marks and then the desired parameters can then be inserted .
under Settings K@@ ile ; setup ... tile ; can be made to these lists . it can be used to list different types lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ commands as well as options for general language @-@ use .
the command mode is not used for the execution of environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin and the call for completion mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are so often used that &amp; K@@ ile ; a special mode for completing the environments .
the command to open the environment is automatically inst@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously and it appears \ \ begin { . after this , the command can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and by pressing the input button .
once this is done , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; K@@ ile ; re@@ alizes that it is a list environment , is even a first \ \ item command .
under Settings K@@ ile ; setup ... tile ; can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of encryption mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; K@@ ile ; supports user @-@ defined lists of enh@@ ancements , which are instantly subst@@ ituted by foreign strings . the lists can be set up under settings K@@ ile ... K@@ ile can be set up . as an example of a sample list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L is entered and the word processor is introduced over the menu processor , or the keyboard Ctr@@ l + Alt Emp@@ ty , the letter L is replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large bÃ ¶ r@@ ter@@ bÃ ¼ cher are not helpful for automatic digest@@ ion . however , it has been found that many sellers are written more than once in a document . there@@ with &amp; K@@ ile ; the complete damage for all already written honey@@ mo@@ vers .
this mode can be set up in the settings K@@ ile ... K@@ ile will be less@@ ened . here also the threshold value can be set for the display of the execution .
the exec@@ uting files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ ile / complete / mode / des Pers@@ enn@@ ables Home folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the graphics incorporate graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics about the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered .
PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if PDF Output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools can be re@@ arranged and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to be able to examine the result of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all the tools are group@@ ed group@@ ed into the menus creating comp@@ iling , creating converting and creating view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; or the other conversion can be used the keyboard Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be converted to a file by means of Alt ; 3 , by means of Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted to a PS file and by means of Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
when using the Quick @-@ mounting command , a viewer is normally called upon after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will be opened every time .
a new project is about the project New Project .... here , the following information is requested for the project :
when exec@@ uting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ds@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; K@@ ile ; allows exec@@ uting EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be administ@@ ered over scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be used in further versions of &amp; K@@ ile ; nor else .
first , it must be said that the development environment of the scripts in &amp; K@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = K@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; l@@ atex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a lot of different assistance to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . this includes a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; l@@ atex ; reference .
this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather a complete manual for the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands contain and is thus ideal for searching for a certain format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; K@@ ile ; it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the quantity of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ to@@ k , which contains a database with all documents and documents supplied and there@@ for a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the gre@@ edy advantage is the search for package names or Schlag@@ wÃ ¶ r@@ tern . von &amp; K@@ ile ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or pressing the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; K@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; l@@ atex ; - / tex ; source text editor available on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; work space environment ; is also a part of the Fink project , thus &amp; K@@ ile ; also on &amp; Mac ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with OS @-@ X installed .
many thanks to those who strive for the continued existence of the &amp; K@@ ile ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools we all use under consideration of the &amp; GNU ; license . up @-@ to @-@ date information on the contribut@@ ors is available in the Help menu .

&amp; sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signat@@ ures for e @-@ mails . with the command line interface , you create random signat@@ ures or daily signat@@ ures from a list . this command line interface provides the signat@@ ures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signat@@ ures any signature will be read from the signat@@ ures file . by many signat@@ ures with different quotes , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for everyday signat@@ ures , the same signature from the signat@@ ures file is read by &amp; sig . for each day you use different signat@@ ures , as with the random signat@@ ures create unique e @-@ mails .
to create a new signature , select Ctr@@ l ; N file New . this gives you an lt ; empty signat@@ ures ; in the section Sig@@ nat@@ ures . click the &amp; lt ; empty signat@@ ures ; and add in the bottom section your new signature .
you can create as many signat@@ ures as you like . then you have a list of signat@@ ures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; . whether you use emails private or professionally , there are always enough signat@@ ures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then remove it from the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross removal in the toolbar .
open the Short@@ cuts dialog . here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the User button on the right and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination .

anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de documentation , mein@@ pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s pick it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer need to rely on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on the icon for the XML processor and done !
this application is a@@ waiting a index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the ge@@ ared working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and specify the folder you want in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; html ; files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; there is now a great graphical surface for it .
if the currently opened file index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then simply select the current job folder . if not , then select current work folders and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to a output on the screen , its file is incorrect . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , then they can be deleted simply . if not , delete the file with the current file and select the file to be checked using other file - file selection .
if you just want to know if the file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed check selection .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file specified in the &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; using Defin@@ itions @-@ UR@@ I ; diagram as well as for Rel@@ ax@@ NG verification is required to specify the definition UR@@ I ; in file selection .
yes , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; hat auch ein &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is already sel@@ ectable , then the current file is simply cli@@ cked . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection file .
specify the name of the file , as the result is to be named , and the file is normally stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plugin system is very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not need to wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . the plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we start editing with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a location &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project multiple people in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog .
the name and e @-@ mail entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for clear identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this is done by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identification ) will appear bold by which you are : text .
nick@@ name and setting of your own identity are important regarding messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to the overview of your team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing the members of the team : an event for information to the team leaders can be created when something happens . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the Event Con@@ figuration of Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the addres@@ see selected in the recipient list . the addres@@ see may be a team or sub@@ project manager . see in , wei such leaders will be set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments through the following things :
to enter comments is simple . either the note entry can be selected from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key word in a comment area followed by note text .
notes can be sent to an identi@@ fiable member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , the nick@@ name of the introduced nick@@ name of the team member , plays a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project manager .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper@@ case or lo@@ wer@@ case , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages supported by DT@@ D ag@@ no@@ stic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by Quant@@ a Settings ... This dialog extends over a few pages that are treated after each other .
the behavior of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags , including auto @-@ completion , can be changed with it . the entries are :
big / L@@ ump@@ y of tags : big / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal and lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically close : if you click , it will be added for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
not include optional tags : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
start and end tag automatically : when switched on , the corresponding closing day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic inser@@ tion of ac@@ cent characters : controls automatic conversion of ac@@ cent@@ u@@ ated characters into corresponding enco@@ ding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ s for the detection of different types of files . using the standard button , standard specifications can be restored .
default character enco@@ ding : the enco@@ ding of newly created or otherwise opened as with file Open opened files ( where enco@@ ding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting here will be st@@ ung out of the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting here will be st@@ ung out of the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies so that in case of a power failure or crash during the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a map ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
reset the window settings to the standard at the next start is useful when the user interface is passed through by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / depen@@ dencies of views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning message area is used to control the display of aler@@ ts by hook from no more requests .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in shared mode . with regard to the different modes , see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action solved by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the structure tree settings area , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , which is to be opened automatically when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document .
the area for setting abbrevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) , which can be un@@ folded for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means it can give a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ cl@@ ause abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug@@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are K@@ Part applications from third page , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin , if it is not on a stand@@ ar like $ K@@ D@@ ED@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; load Comp@@ onent in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nur @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is denied the load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse the loading if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plugin : if this is activated , then test &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; whether the information entered is correct , even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bug@@ ging has been completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been set , as well as support for the D@@ BG de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in concept was implemented that enables different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin select box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all stops , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower Do@@ ck .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower Do@@ ck .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , all or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger if required , or it shares the plugin with to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in the normal case it is not necessary to pay attention to it .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or exit the listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request will be displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output view .
tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and send information on the monitored variables as well as the current executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution continues . happens , before a de@@ bit &apos;s requirement is started , the script starts with the request .
tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without any information about un@@ monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens , while a script is stopped , the execution continues .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next statement in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next statement in the script , whereby if possible in functions and include it is incorrect .
shows the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the statement and go to the next as if there were the current ones .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog allows you to enter a variable or set a new value to a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how you can and quant@@ ap@@ lus ; can help to get better .
document type E@@ diti@@ er@@ Pack@@ ete ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for mark@@ up and script languages as well as &amp; CSS . their simplicity and flexibility makes &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folder contains two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool bars are handy , symbo@@ li@@ zed bodies of image kno@@ bs ( above the editing window ) , which add text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property di@@ alog@@ ger , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the tag displays the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a fast inser@@ tion of tags to a document without any danger of typ@@ ist .
tag folder are nothing but folder . they contain only the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the write language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type above itself nothing else .
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the day type class valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describe an attribute of a tag . this element can only be used once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . in addition , it contains other tags that describe how to display this attribute , etc ; This is a single element type element .
returns the source code used for the attribute in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface inside &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name inside &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to define . this element is a single element type .
returns a list of elements that end a tag . this item is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but watch &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; replace it . this will not cause a break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is the top in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and select Tag@@ X@@ M@@ L. to choose . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to be followed .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , the check only takes place when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; scheme . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is as pretty easy and there is an editor for re@@ achable via DT@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite DT@@ D settings . this can be edited by a list sel@@ ectable &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should create a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = User 1 for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can set actions to set up actions ... click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the button short@@ cut assigned to this action . clicking the user button can assign a keyboard short@@ cut ; with K@@ 1 the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the simpl@@ est actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text will be inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which can change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , start . examples from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the quick@@ start dialog or the different sets in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EPs .
first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . in this way &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the script is tried in the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Quant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables used in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Quant@@ a / scripts .
% f : we replace the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
% pi@@ d : will be subst@@ ituted with PID of the current &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; if by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is executed , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script can be input from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the default input , you can specify what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types issue : normal output , written to standard output ; error messages , to the default output output . it can be specified what to be done with the text written to the default output by setting the output field output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group . in the given case , there are not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the tag .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to set actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all required fields and add the tag to the right tool bar .
complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialog &quot; Edit tag &quot; when available so that an input is possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol , that the action is better represented , we &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Other Programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually regarded as useless , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ led ; -@@ Tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with settings to set actions ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and select the desired action . next to the text box there is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so there are , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the toolbar or it should be divided to a better overview by some separ@@ ator into several groups . open the toolbar to set dialog using Settings Tool@@ bars . make sure the desired toolbar is selected .
I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I want a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ator supports group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar must be tested by sampling all symbols to ensure that everything works .
backup in the correct folder . after new XML does not exist , it will be created in root folders , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust your descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that its toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user , it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might be able to check in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Re@@ posit@@ ory whether someone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . then you need to leave the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # Elements in the main index top element = your description for these documentation e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html ... &#91; Cont@@ ext &#93; Cont@@ ext@@ List = func@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = func@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation as something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 , PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = index@@ .html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = Basic syntax
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub @-@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and more consequ@@ ential at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be shown ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but watch &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files .
the portion of the content is the domain of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is used for the context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script to display the documentation for the mysq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by selecting the function name and pressing Ctr@@ l ; H for context help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of separate context elements that are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ D@@ ED@@ IR / share / apps / Quant@@ a / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are certain that this is good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Community . you will not be rich , but be proud to have been involved in the best web development platform .
with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the disc@@ ern@@ ing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or anything else . in various locations , you can send an Email , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , send tool bar toolbar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all others &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and made available only if our team uses them correctly and useful for the publication . to make an amend@@ ment , we recommend to sign the resources for which it takes a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the source of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users .
when you are up@@ loading , you are asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the New resource dialog , the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded by the DT@@ D DT@@ D @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool@@ bars , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the template and script tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signi@@ fication . in case of problems it war@@ ns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in the tag@@ XML format . there is the easiest way to convert DT@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and conver@@ ts a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which is to be used . then the following dialog appears :
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written by this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defin@@ itions line : the string that is in the ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ BLI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and get full benefits from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this chapter tries to introduce these concepts to them , without understanding their understanding &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; from tool@@ bars to actions is all that is marked as global , in the shared folder structure of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; it allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements are a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are custom patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which enables the shared use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the tab@@ s with information and the tool@@ bars . please refer to , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as close the current , other or all card im@@ prints , re@@ load , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or run CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right click in the editor area leads to another context menu with regard to the processed document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing the tags under the mouse poin@@ ter or opening the file when the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top end of the editor window , the toolbar consists of the editor . currently &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional forms the standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , for example &amp; lt ; then click the icon that represents the tag , then you can enter the data for this just inserted tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields .
the construction views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and strip them . in the presentation with tab@@ s stand for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes , and documentation construction views .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view displays all the files in the project and allows you to manage the files in the project using right mouse click . actions like adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be done with the displayed context menu .
another possibility of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a complete website , etc ; all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . the category depends on &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; work@@ space . global templates are always available , local templates only usable for the respective users and templates in projects are only usable in the project .
here you will find information about the scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking a element , a list of commands will open in relation to navigation and refresh@@ ment of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can be changed . the alignment system that is directed to the content allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . it can be downloaded pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Quant@@ a . thus , for example , the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab displays all errors in the Mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Scrip@@ ts executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool bars are extensively developed and easy to understand . show on a symbol and they display the appropriate command . the cho@@ col@@ ates of the tool bar is the possibility of defining your own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via e @-@ mail ; if they receive a tool bar in an email , they can save and load them in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help .
if you have problems with starting &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of their bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid Web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a suggest@@ ive idea : what would be if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; a stand@@ alone , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him an absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML , then &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; it should be the appropriate &amp; IDE ;
now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why develop what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; so to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted promotions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is possible almost every task . through the program com@@ man@@ ders , they can expand &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , without having to remember any scrip@@ ting language syntax . ( see more on it in . )
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and quickly developed to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus is in no way linked to commercial versions of &amp; Quant@@ a ; the original developers left the G@@ PL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more detailed documentation is with help : / Quant@@ a ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Quant@@ a ) .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; is currently being developed and looked after by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , where the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there will convert special characters to &amp; HTML , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting instruction .
convert the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; description , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s in the An@@ ker tag .
switches the block selection to or from . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; key .
goes directly to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; script error messages exist !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of script functions and de@@ bu@@ gger .
switching and switching the problem re@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as one switches to the structure tree .
displays the column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries Pre@@ vious or Next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed by the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from disk . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
search the project directory for new files that could be there . this enables you to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
settings , such as &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . in the chapter &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects you will find the details .
loads a project toolbar . these are stored in Project Dir / Tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by setting actions . tool@@ bars are saved by means of tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
remo@@ ves a tool bar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do so .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment .
allows the loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where anyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / ref@@ resh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities are to be refresh@@ ed from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; without ren@@ e@@ wing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbar . if the standard ( HTML , ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current tag setting dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or dis@@ ables the intelligent paste of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by means of tool@@ bars , if this day is contrary to the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the above menu items . click on it . clicking on an activated plug @-@ in is disabled .
select the syntax mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the original version ; -@@ version .
sel@@ ects the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of the user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching times may need time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card game mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
displays the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window or off .
the changes in this dialog include any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
sets the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; nbsp ; you can find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or which can be added and the sequences can change .
this should create a help in accordance with the mouse @-@ cursor environment , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , for example after completing the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all of these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o .
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here is the server address of the machine you want to access , one , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ example ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol are used . depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared compilation of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared compilation of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . on server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
let you stop when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is started from scratch , not hooks .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an accurate selection of good hand@@ pieces .
this displays a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project .
the latest screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the window frame or using the Shift key Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in detail . additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows you to select the de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button . the de@@ bug@@ ging plugin is described .
in the window profiles , high loading profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , placing your own tree view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration , event actions can be switched on and add , modify or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs , such as saving a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened , cannot influence this behavior at present .
to open another project , select project open ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will be shown and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project management view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folder beha@@ ves as well , but the entries are missing and opening with ... in the context menu call@@ able with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
allows removing the current profile . if there is only more a profile , the button will end to prevent removal .
the password is kept in memory and forgotten with program@@ ing . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is needed and the rather un@@ certain password on the disk save option does not come into question .
this will stop transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog appears :
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed k@@ io Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . the password is saved on the disk , so it can not be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply do@@ cking the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened or deleted from the Menu Project or the project toolbar , which can be accessed , opened or deleted via Settings Tool@@ bar project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to its own working method .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars are in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is best designed using the Tool@@ bar menu . the addition of tool bar is treated at the bottom of the Add Tool@@ bar section .
the toolbar and the icons on this can be set either using the context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which new action , a new toolbar can be created , allowing other actions such as tool@@ bars , ren@@ aming toolbar , or tool@@ bars , which can be specified in the dialog where you can specify which actions on this or other toolbar can be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar , additional entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings Tool@@ bars ... and set Settings sets .
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code @-@ escal@@ op@@ es and files for linking . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates as a common fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations you submit to the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions set at the beginning of each template before use .
bin@@ ary is everything that is not pure text . it can be any file except text , pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ ary templates are usually inserted in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are found in the template tree under global templates . more information on the template tree is available .
documents can be created from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually more specified documents are made in corresponding sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this type of templates is useful if not a new document on a template , but the same text area should be inserted in the documents again and again . you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples are to be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire websites . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template save as a local template ...
once this is done , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click Save As a template to save as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drag@@ ged with drag and drop to the tree view templates .
the creation of bin@@ ary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder on the right and select Site template , enter a name for the template , and backup . by default , the project folder is backed up , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can design he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ D@@ ED@@ IR / share / apps / Quant@@ a / templates and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Quant@@ a / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded as soon as el@@ ter@@ nal attributes are inher@@ ited .
this is enabled by default and fits for everything except the regular folders in the template pane . if a root folder would be so set , it would disable templates in this path , unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying contents in a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) using a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one location to another .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor available via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source code editor with the V@@ PL ; editor and the second , the editor window will divide into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and rever@@ t to the source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor of a document containing &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit &amp; PHP ; it is still necessary to edit the source code editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes in both the source @-@ text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor are visible and the cursor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is already active . pressing F@@ 9 this mode is already active , the push button puts the active cursor from one window to another , maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ ization gap between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor can be set up via Settings Quant@@ a .... Accor@@ ding to the choice of V@@ PL , you can select between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation is : a small margin for fast machine and a large span for slow .
it is assumed that you want to change the title of the website so that tools document properties can be chosen . thus the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called upon as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . this can be changed :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list enables the change of the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list .
it is possible to mount an external CSS style template by pressing the file opening button and selecting the appropriate file .
the use of the cursor is possible like in a word processor , because of moving with arrows . under rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves strange . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and del@@ eting using the back button or remove button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way about the tool@@ bars , as in the source text editor . it is important to note that the inser@@ tion of tags before already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. if an anchor tag is inserted with text , any other converted anchor tag must be removed .
some tool@@ bars like the tables wiz@@ ard or the lists wiz@@ ard are disabled . they will later work in the &amp; V@@ PL ; work , in this release the tables or lists must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for exam@@ ining sty@@ listic periods . in contrast to other programs for style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the performance of the style template can be pursued .
to be able to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; besides &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries are lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available .
stop in a template , at a place in a style or x@@ ml file loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g or on the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , ver@@ sion@@ ed stops can be set in a specific file and line number and later enabled .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a file name without path specification . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style template file name with relative path to the work@@ ing@@ folder with x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is , for example , a sty@@ le@@ pro@@ position file . / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or entire agreement is checked with a notice called my@@ QNA@@ P@@ cloud or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template matches with any QNAP string containing the string template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the given &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 will &amp; eg ; extends to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a sought @-@ after item must be dis@@ band@@ ed for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically executed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stops are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each run .

there are many graphical tools for comparing . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I have written .
the mer@@ ging was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another program@@ mer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts during mer@@ ging .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where maybe only the ind@@ entation had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
so this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the compar@@ ative windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ d@@ ged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently from each other at one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when assemb@@ ling :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you have to frequently check code , you will like this feature .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can look at a glance at the summary in the column on the left hand side . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , then you can ease the typ@@ ing work by writing only the file name of the first file . example :
folder 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 -@@ o Ziel@@ folder k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 -@@ o Target folder
opening dialog enables manual typ@@ ing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list .
using the button Fol@@ der ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the comparing or merge of folders will be introduced . if a file is selected for A , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then use the file name from A in the two other folders .
when coll@@ ating is checked , the input field is active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not strictly necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this step later when saving .
the Setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active compar@@ ative window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog you don &apos;t have to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what thought is there ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you would need to create two appropriate files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; load them and then compare it . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dro@@ pping text into a compar@@ ative window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t drag and drop text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data might be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach Info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while over the line . then a small auxiliary window will show the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , you see the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color for this is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merge ) good to see .
left next to the text is the summary column . when differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases relevant . )
the vertical line that separates the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is activated , the line is shown dotted lines .
the result window ( under the comparison windows ) also has an info row with the in@@ scription output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; when you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the kno@@ bs jump to next dissolved / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference must also be resolved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown . ( this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for the current pane and on the left there appears a black bar .
sometimes by automatic mer@@ ging or by manual editing , no more line is left in the group ; then in these lines of the text &amp; lt ; no row is displayed in the queu@@ e ; this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marking that you may copy and insert somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; drag @-@ to @-@ drop ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy this text from the result window . carefully go with this function .
note : when selecting the sources the options ignore or ignore ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white signs .
navigate mainly with the frame and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , down , side down , side , beginning , end , Ctr@@ l @-@ start and Str@@ g end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
in the aug@@ mentation window you can also use the other buttons for editing . using the paste button you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ies synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as explained in the section merge and the ed@@ itable output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ picture upwards / Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous un@@ solved conflict .
to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( Ctr@@ l @-@ C or Ctr@@ l paste ) . it also prints the option selection automatically . if this is enabled , whatever you mark , automatically copied to the clip@@ board and manually copied the manual copying . be careful with this option , as you may acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
line end@@ ings are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use Wag@@ en@@ backward + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line files of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ ary files .
the options and the list of most recently used files will be automatically saved during loading and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use it . )
when you enable this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ic script . if the selected ty@@ pe@@ face does not support this display , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form , but would be rendered ast@@ ert . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically creates an un@@ paved color .
when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise a tab character is inserted .
if you press Enter or Return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied to the clip@@ board . the manual copy to the clip@@ board will then be copied .
you can select which line type you prefer for saving . the default value is the generally accepted selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines can be found in the source files . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white signs will not be ignored . even when assemb@@ ling white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a loader &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others store only a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . usually , batch rec@@ ir@@ ation marks are made visible , but then they may be disabled with different sizes in the page @-@ an @-@ page comparison , but as a white sign . during mer@@ ging , this option has to be disabled .
in the first part of the analysis , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; -@@ &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; -@@ &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
this option is disabled in default . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters .
intensive after even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complex and large files , but slow in very large files .
in automatic re @-@ jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ solved conflict will continue .
automatically trig@@ gers all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the features Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu .
these options are discussed in the chapter for scanning of folders and performing a merge . look for details under documentation about the directory comparison and merge .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version of the suff@@ ix .@@ orig . if already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ orig exists , it will be deleted without further backup .
adap@@ ting this option does not affect the current running program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart , so that the change will be active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because language is being set globally via the control centre . )
the following enco@@ ding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
over the boxes for enco@@ ding appears a short notice what the local enco@@ ding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the enco@@ ding is individually adjustable for each file , even files can be compared and merged with different enco@@ ding .
when you have edited a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding to be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Unic@@ ode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the enco@@ ding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing ignor@@ ing C / C + + commentary . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color enco@@ ded overview column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal yet another second overview column with the required information .
sometimes you &apos;d rather want to use the space available on the screen for long lines . just stop the less important windows . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
arran@@ ges the compar@@ ative windows side by side or over@@ lap . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as pre@@ set names for the output file . ( if this feature is used to restart the merge file , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor which corresponds exactly to your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut anno@@ ying parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first passed to that external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . the output of the command is only used in line comparison . you can write your own pre@@ processor which corresponds exactly to your requirements . each line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to allow users more flexibility when setting the diff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it by themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for line comparison to convert the input into upper@@ case letters : sed &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an exempl@@ ary expression of the text found in a line . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically generate created strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word substitu@@ tion ) . all will follow the same pattern $ keywords . * \ \ $ / \ \ $ \ \ 1 \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ processing command for new@@ line @-@ like sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform several compositions at once . then you can use the sem@@ icol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use &apos; to separate the compositions apart . example :
instead of sed you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / substitu@@ tion / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; Ho@@ wever , some details are different with per@@ l . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor is retained for the ad and to merge . the other operations only change the data that the line comparison algorith@@ m sees .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programm@@ ers have to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively and merge .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can customize the proposal before starting ,
... can sim@@ ulate the merge and shows the sim@@ ulated changes without really carrying out it ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and assemb@@ ling individual files . you must specify only folders on the command line or in the dialog box .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not merge . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
while reading the folder , you will receive a small message window on the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that were previously compared will be listed .
when scanning the folder is complete , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder that has been found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can fold up a folder by clicking on + / - or double @-@ click on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the folder menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories and un@@ fold all sub@@ directories with which you can open all folders .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as seen in the above picture , in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black are used .
if identical entries the color is identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . in folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later , when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the mode to synchron@@ ize is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option folders are synchron@@ ized , then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then select the necessary action , so that afterwards both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and the option to select a new file instead of merge ( un@@ certain ) , then check &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and fails to copy the same date , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not eliminated , the mer@@ ging of the folders cannot be started .
during mer@@ ging a file will be processed after the other . you status column shows skill if the merge was successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is okay everywhere .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , deleted , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for solved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the just selected entry ( file or folder ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you do not specify a destination folder then in the three @-@ folder merge mode C is used as target , when two @-@ folder merge B is chosen as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as a target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options that could be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries , select folder merge / continue in the menu menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry , select the action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if there are still invalid mer@@ ging actions by conf@@ lic@@ ting data types , a message appears that identi@@ fies the def@@ ective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box with the options will pop up , sim@@ ulate and Cancel .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge @-@ window will open ( see the screen@@ shot ) .
if you &apos;re done with a file , select the folder merge to start / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t yet saved , a corresponding dialog will appear . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error occurs , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to ski@@ p the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you have the option to try another action for the entry or to solve the problem in another way before proce@@ eding with the merge .
if some entries were merged individually , notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them during the later merge . even if the merge event was ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be treated as done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( set menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called Directory merge with these options :
only files that fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . there can be multiple patterns entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ icol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folder must not match this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ icol@@ on ; as a del@@ im@@ iter . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig . * .@@ o .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ icol@@ on ; as a del@@ im@@ iter . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig . * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ ism@@ atic files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder specific can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hide attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a leading point has a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
when the option is turned off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
if the option is turned on , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to a loop loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes . ) This option is switched off in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the stati@@ stic columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is s@@ lower than a simple bin@@ ary analysis , and much s@@ lower when applied to files that contain no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the date of change and file size . however , this speed unit costs you a certain level of security . please use cau@@ tion . this option is dep@@ rec@@ ated in default .
the files are considered identical if they are equal to them . this can be useful for example , if the change date has been lost when copying . please use cau@@ tion . this option is dep@@ rec@@ ated in default .
synchron@@ ize mode when compared to two folders and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging files are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . also the results of merge files are saved in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , instead the merge of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered to be uns@@ af@@ e as it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is ren@@ amed and receives the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ orig extension , it will also be deleted without further backup . this also applies to the normal mer@@ ging of individual files , not just the mer@@ ging of entire folders . this option is switched on in default .
normally the folder merge view remains visible to the mer@@ ging of individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can turn the option directory &amp; text window to switch the main window in the window menu and switch between directory &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , there is a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu . you can also use a single file directly , without first having to run the folder together . once you save the result , the status will be set to the controller and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder together .
however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : new read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should you consider :
a path can be relative . or contain .. This is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , Space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished if a link indicates a file or folder . then a file is always assumed as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the date of change differ from the original . ( note the option of confidentiality of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently being as a difference viewer in AD@@ BA . K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OR from the context menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is applied as a K@@ Part , then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the Cont@@ ext Menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s compact ) is already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I &apos;ve been using G@@ PL programs very long and learned a lot by listening to the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programm@@ ers who have gone this way or going to go this way .
you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably does not have the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can not find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines app@@ ear next to each other , this nice coinci@@ dence but this one is often the case .
the editor notes each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to simply resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information .
you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit large amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to empha@@ size differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
see htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
um &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of that .
cut out ( Ctr@@ l @-@ X or Shift Del@@ ete ) copies to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . paste ( Ctr@@ l @-@ V or Shift ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position and replaces the current marking .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder .
( in the current program version you need to re @-@ read the folder with the function update after changes to these options . )
this will also cause identical files to merge into the target folder . if the destination folder doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably change in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to select the source from A , B and C under the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button .
in default this option is disabled . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ spaces , change its size , end it or move it . this works both inside a desktop and at several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button window can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other work@@ spaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries to set up ... and ending . if , however , click on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; you will also see the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ izing , maxim@@ izing , on desktop and ending . the commands cause the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other des@@ kt@@ ops .
when this field is crossed , the name of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops is displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is marked with name , the names are provided with ordin@@ al numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st working area .
when this field is ti@@ cked , the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is ti@@ cked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty spaces will appear to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon displays the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window can be determined : classical lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ R@@ aster , as from P@@ ager applications appear in some other window managers ; horizontal displays all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal row , which is very good for representation side@@ ways on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ Module in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , view and move the windows as symbols or with its content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ector switch ... allow the dialog to pop up settings .
at the moment , this can not be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have any write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator .
since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages .

you can use &amp; k@@ like ; enlarge a part of the screen , as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for various users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual imp@@ air@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ;
&amp; k@@ mag ; it is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
if you like &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window will be called a magni@@ fication window . the image that is shown in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as selection window in the following .
in default , the area around the mouse poin@@ ter looks like a mo@@ vable magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; this causes a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( drop @-@ down mode ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is shown in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor to hide . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fier window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you are additionally using the &amp; Shift ; key , or the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the bottom right corner is to be moved .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer to copy into a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more .
start or stop the update . stopping the update causes the required CPU time against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
this mode displays a selection window . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set @-@ up commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , new@@ line ( loaded with the button document in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Ver@@ tical &amp; etc ; .
you can &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier , as if you use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually imp@@ aired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter per@@ si@@ sts at the same place . it is meant to help people suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome ( Re@@ pet@@ itive @-@ Str@@ ain @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and which every mouse @-@ click has pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter per@@ si@@ sts at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Re@@ pet@@ itive Str@@ ain In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome and which each mouse @-@ press causes pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate drag@@ ging with the mouse . this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain created by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also be caused by the naked p@@ ains caused by the mouse . suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , if this is not yet done .
to clarify it once again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; P@@ ain helps prevent pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools : the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click as soon as you break the motion .
if the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it moves the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement before rele@@ asing the mouse button . in this way , you can execute the pulling with pressed mouse button . the intelligent moving requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this time of residence must be stored at the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mou@@ sec@@ lick carries out .
if Intel@@ lig@@ entes move on , the turn@@ field is switched off ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , the mouse button will pause when there is no moving the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse shift . if this feature is enabled , a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow move to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . these movements are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can do &amp; k@@ de ; go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose sound system and here the tab General . there is a slider bar sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to sh@@ orten the response times .
if this option is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; please refer to the respective documentation for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to start a program automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you already pressed the user button , the settings will be reset to the user &apos;s last press .
the best way to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first of all with the default settings . in particular , you should start off at first . if you are ac@@ custom@@ ed to automatic mouse click , you can later shift the intelligent move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first , you should make aware of which places a mouse @-@ click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral ingredients of windows or in places in the browser window that does not link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty easy . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first , you have to take the mouse ball out . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rollers . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and dirt can be scrat@@ ched easily with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the smart move in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation cannot stop by rele@@ asing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute the mouse clicks and move the cursor to another location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to have it . but use mouse on a neutral area of desktop when you want to make a keyboard input . thus , a acci@@ dental protection of mouse &amp; eg can cause un@@ inten@@ tional reactions . safe zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the intelligent move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is highly prob@@ able to copy text to copy it to the clip@@ board or to insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice on this :
do not use the smart move if you just start using k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select text instead : press a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will cause every time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pressed a sound like a mouse click . later you can use the intelligent move without using the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the X@@ Test extension need to be installed for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are properly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is short@@ ened . this program was developed for people suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome and those who are causing pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to allow a specified time to begin a pulling process before the mouse button is left off . in this way , drag@@ ging and dro@@ pping with the mouse can also be performed .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that can let mu@@ te users speak their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose sets of phrases that are to be talked again .
on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command later used for the text output of text . for more details , refer to the description of the installation catalogue .
on the second page , select the standard text@@ book text@@ book . from the text passages you can often choose used text passages without having to typ@@ ed them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you set the dictionary for the word short@@ cut . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elling words can be included in the word completion .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and an exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the already spoken pro@@ positions ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; correct , in the input field you can enter the sets you want to hear . each spoken set is attached to the memory memory . you can select sets that are to be talked again .
with the Con@@ mouth menu item , set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the site short@@ cut as well as the DI@@ V@@ SD language service page .
in the box of the cardboard card voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field under the input field , specify the enco@@ ding that is passed on to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as default input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with possibility to use ct@@ ts@@ d as a voice service &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the further settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d speech service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ em@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications are a standardized interface for voice output , and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text@@ book text@@ book or in the bar for text@@ book text@@ books .
with the selection of In stock , the selected text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the course memory . with the selection of In the input field the selected text passage is first entered into the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down box of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text passages book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
with the selection of text passages , the book will be saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text@@ book will not be saved . select Save Before , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask whether to save the text@@ book &apos;s book .
the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ zung page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word short@@ cut . in the main window , next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box when this list contains more than one dictionary .
with buttons on the right hand side of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can specify the language for the dictionary in the input field .
select the language you want to use for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the &amp; k@@ de documentation . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words in the new dictionary .

the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided . in the upper part , the text@@ book text@@ books are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage of text or the corresponding short@@ cut . if you have selected a text@@ book , you can only change its name .
add actions such as new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , either via the selection in the menu bar , toolbar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; alt key .

you probably don &apos;t have the command for the speech output properly or not fully entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; open the page General settings and enter the command for voice output on the map language output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers for further details . )
the festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the directory / usr / local / festival . the command for voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and to propag@@ ate without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the setup of the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ ad . the voice output is then possible with one of the following command samples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as default input . ( this is the recommended example for using Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ man@@ tle the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows MB@@ RO@@ LA to use free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / ha@@ di@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax usually swal@@ lows the last character of the text so that an additional sign must be added . therefore , the full command is more costly than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / ha@@ di@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data must be turned on as default input .
the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ more language service that provides a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use it as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to setup , use the DI@@ V@@ SD language service , which appears in the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with people who cannot speak , save text by the computer . it is stored a list of already spoken phrases that the user can re@@ produce again and again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer includes . on the machine a voice syn@@ thesizer has to be installed .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or run k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - The voice output system by &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows every application to read text via the &amp; D@@ Bus interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programm@@ ers with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities . users also offer interesting options .
read texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor and are therefore unique ; , even if &amp; works ; in other &amp; more ; -@@ applications embedded .
the voice @-@ overs are used by the program speech @-@ dispens@@ er , which uses various background programs such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc .
enables the creation of language editions on the command line ( or using shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ help program .
in ZU@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ SML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .

before you can use , you need to install program speech sof@@ ter and set correctly . see also
at the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card @-@ card speaker will appear . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card tab will be displayed in General . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thesi@@ zers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use it , since the program speed @-@ dispens@@ er otherwise uses the default speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer drivers for the same printer .
when you click on the card @-@ runner Spe@@ aker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card card speaker will be displayed . it will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and not a speaker set up yet .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for speech output if an application does not present any speakers .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list to a row further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; Desktop system .
choose a vocal type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the board map speaker . in order to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the card tab and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so the T@@ TS service starts from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the map to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the voice output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click the tab card in General to open this card tab . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to enable the K@@ DE T@@ TS service . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card tab will be displayed , and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marking , will hold K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; dis@@ ables .
if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is finished , it will run &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the box is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and tal @-@ sm@@ gr automatically appears in the Control Panel &apos;s system pane , it dis@@ appears once the preview is completed .
with buttons in this series , you can start , pause , pause and resu@@ me text jobs .
with the buttons in this row you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board can be read before or opening a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all sides .
the card tab orders will only appear when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the tab@@ s tab and select voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check the text you want to read , and select text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML , he@@ aders and other un@@ seen brands are also read .
in &amp; b. ; the extended text editor by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read displayed text . first check the text you want to read , and select the text you want to read and select in the main menu Tools Text . then the speech output should start .
this also works , if &amp; nbsp ; in other applications embedded , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Quant@@ a ; .
K@@ Not@@ ify is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; it noti@@ fies you about the events you set out . you can read the text of this news as well .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . you can set up &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel , where your nick@@ name comes . with &amp; ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Program in K@@ Not@@ ify , a menu item will appear in the Settings menu of this program . the settings for K@@ Not@@ ify are different depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is included in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . it remo@@ ves the tags br and b from the messages that send K@@ Mail , and also the print@@ out / local / in@@ box because it can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal working with &amp; ts ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is processed before it is sent to the speech @-@ dispens@@ er program . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech Disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differenti@@ ates four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of Screen Reader is read , the ordered orders are resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the output of the warning .
messages have the next highest priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a web page , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; anyone who is entering the room is also news .
the rest are simple text orders . each job you encounter from the card tab is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are meant for the output of longer texts that do not have special ur@@ gency .
all four com@@ missions are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a Screen Re@@ aders while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such preview , this issue will pause and termin@@ ate .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter the text and pass it to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there are still further types of filters .
string subst@@ itutes will replace parts of a text with other text . the pieces to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is supplied with pre@@ defined string subst@@ itutes , which enable the creation of chat messages such as : - ) by text or for reform@@ at@@ ting news from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included for translation &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with inter@@ phone selection filters , you can send assign@@ ments depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have a female voice on the board map speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . read about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , depending on which it is applied for a speech output . if the filter stip@@ ulates that its rules are not applicable , it continues to pass the text unchanged to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that were set up on the page below . editing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the established normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter and the following setup di@@ alogs are displayed below .
for the creation of string substitu@@ tion filters , you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the corresponding substitute text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only needs to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is processed from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; Ctr@@ l key at the mouse click .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by com@@ ma . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs can be provided with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ numbers you must om@@ it . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application id copy @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter copy .
the string replace filter is applied only to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter apply if matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison with words , the string replace filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. words must therefore be restricted by separ@@ ator ( space ) on both sides .
in this manual you will not find instructions to write regular expressions . but if you have the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it in the di@@ alogs or Edit as help to con@@ se these expressions . the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions you will find in the package k@@ de@@ uti@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . it can only be applied to well formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient .
with the speaker selection filter , you can send texts to a particular speaker set up on the Cart@@ ridge speaker or to a speaker with specific characteristics . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before ref@@ using a text to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker properties , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the characteristics of the speaker set up on the Cart@@ ridge speaker . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ ride the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help during the input .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the subscri@@ ber you want . if the text ful@@ fills the filter conditions above , the speaker is selected , which matches the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to display the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter will only apply to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programm@@ ers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of the voice output API by &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both API@@ s can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program ct@@ ts@@ d to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of text for reading and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ Window . start rec@@ t@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; but when using the module for festival sites , websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to allow SA@@ BLE at all . you must also do that if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found using the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation signs seem to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or only che@@ wing @-@ cat@@ fish is spent . what can I do about it ?
first make sure the option character enco@@ ding is set to the correct language for the corresponding language . if there are problems with specific characters or words , they may be corrected by a string replace filter .

the language syn@@ thesi@@ zers , used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license you will find in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package deal with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can download it in the folder per@@ ts@@ d . also , you will find the source code of k@@ im@@ ams under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages on the project page htt@@ p : / / espe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es@@ .html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ wah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio .
KT@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . also , consult the website of kt@@ ts ; , for information that is not yet included in this manual .
the program &quot; speech Disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers . if you want to expand and extend for the use of any other syn@@ thesizer , please contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used to support SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; it is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or later ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ dispens@@ er . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text archive for de@@ code or download the currently created tar@@ ball , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use it , check first if speech @-@ dispens@@ er works properly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; , which uses the program speech Disp@@ at@@ cher . the ct@@ t@@ ms@@ gr utility should be developed so that the setup of speech dispens@@ ers is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is de@@ composed into single sets . the user can go back to sentence or sat@@ in , repeat the output or cancel the output .
if you give an application text to &amp; kt@@ ts , you can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output , for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is feminine , this will be used , otherwise it will automatically be the best fitting spokes@@ person . if you want to learn more about it , such as &amp; kt@@ ts ; see a speaker .
if you click Add Activity on the card tab and then insert a speaker into the list or click Edit , the board map speaker set will appear . as an example , the setup of the module for festival Inter@@ active will be shown below . details on the modules can be found here .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PAT@@ H , you will have to enter the festival only .
select the string enco@@ ding for text that is passed to the festival . if voices are known , this setting will be set automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages like Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you adjust the volume , voice and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controller and display this gray , the voice you choose does not allow you to adjust these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded when starting K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with larger memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thesi@@ zed more quickly .
if this check box cannot be selected , you do not have a speaker set up ( or for@@ got to click App@@ ly ) . see .
if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is marked and t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not yet exp@@ ire , it will appear in the system area as soon as the K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thus you have the option to stop reading or otherwise control it .
here are all queu@@ es listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the just edited sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column ID on the board card speaker .
with the buttons in this row you can go to the order that is selected in the list below or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on the OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be copied to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stream@@ er or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the Audio Card Audio . see also .
text orders , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed here . further information on the message types of Sche@@ dule can be found here .
here you can select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled , either without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; cannot load the necessary libraries .
if you want to use G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . have you selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speech rate here . 50@@ 0.1 % corresponds to about half and 200@@ N@@ bsp ; % about double normal subscri@@ ber speed . to enable these settings to be implemented , the program must be installed so@@ x .
click App@@ ly to take the new settings for the current &amp; Desktop ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you will need to find out which device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
this card tab allows you to set up special promotions , which will always be executed whenever the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of voice orders :
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . after the output of Screen Reader has been read , the orders received will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you have just read a long text on a web page , you can go to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless welcome someone who is just entering the room .
if a text message is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output to the queu@@ e .
this audio file is always played when a normal text message is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card tab apply only to normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and the output of screen readers , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to start reading K@@ Not@@ ify messages , launch kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click on noti@@ fications . the card card noti@@ fications will appear .

use this sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; to do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the desired subscri@@ ber . standard sel@@ ects the speaker displayed in the list on the map speaker as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a certain application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of certain application .

use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries besides All Not@@ i@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard includes brands for controlling voice , speech , voice , voice and pitch . also brands for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of e.g. abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British ) , as this is the default voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ 0.1 % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and del@@ im@@ iters ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into single phrases . thus , &amp; kt@@ ts ; faster with the preview , as only the first set may be syn@@ thesi@@ zed or stopped or stopped , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer doesn &apos;t support it directly .
here you can see the pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set of positi@@ onal filters is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add other pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters , but beginners will get away from it .
on the easiest way , you will learn how to set up the selection selection by trying out . switch on the selection selection and select text to preview . switch on the selection selection again , change some features and check how the speaker &apos;s selection changes . of course , you have to have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
you can then pause or cancel text orders on the card tab , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set @-@ level indicator filter is set automatically when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing .
the positi@@ onal signs filter compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ positions and insert a tab@@ ulator sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab characters are removed from the text before fil@@ ing ) . note that the default set of positi@@ onal signs ret@@ ains the character set .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of Screen Re@@ aders .
if you have removed the normal set of positi@@ onal filters , you can paste it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the card tab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ aker selection &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can over@@ write the voice settings for the application . the card tab is displayed if you want to display the card . &quot; &quot; &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card &apos;s card speaker ) . in other words : there will be no voice characteristics .
using the most appropriate speaker , which displays all the features of a set @-@ up speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the microphone , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select the Spe@@ aker , the closest to the originally set features .
select the method to enter the desired Spe@@ aker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired subscri@@ ber here . if this feature does not play any role , do not give anything .
select this check box if the property is to have priority over other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ings here .
since the language is a critical factor when leaving the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case in which you may want to specify the attribute language is before , if you know that a particular application sends text in another language than that of the working environment .
to use all the properties in the Sp@@ okes@@ person , which is most likely to delete the following , click the default Spe@@ aker selection button and then use the Spe@@ aker that best matches the following .
in this case 0 is for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr cr@@ ashes immediately when it starts . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get any feedback .

before you use it , check first if your voice syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesi@@ zers , which is open source code . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported .
you have to install at least one language . you will need help in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to set the voice MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . select a C@@ yr@@ il@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) enco@@ ding like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . so search festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the enco@@ ding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the enco@@ ding option needs to be set to an 8 @-@ bit cy@@ n@@ ical like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this di@@ ph@@ onic .
in this process additional wr@@ ap@@ per code to festival is added to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found at
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of the festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it is necessary either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival of
instructions can be found in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file in the package you downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , the playback of bug fixes is not required , you just have to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ s@@ cm .

the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language syn@@ thesizer which can be controlled in a command line .
best use a command to write the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which enables the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a set of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user :
after installing a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to enable &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installing and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the option of network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index is selected . when starting module network settings , this system tries to automatically detect the system used on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the choice is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to the distribution and release . by selecting the setting non @-@ recur@@ ring , the definition can be made permanently . the next start of the network settings will automatically default this selection .
the change of network settings is only possible in the system administration mode . before , all options are displayed gray , which means , the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you get to the right bottom of the module by clicking the button . it is required to enter the password .
in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s :
the tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the tab network interfaces :
the settings of the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings dialog displays the dialog with further options .
in automatic mode the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ OT@@ P server . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ OT@@ P server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ OT@@ P server can be selected according to the system .
the selection Manu@@ ell can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ OT@@ P the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask , the sub@@ net mask must be set .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device box .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the IP address , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched on as needed . switching a switched network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking interface .
network devices can be activated or switched on as needed . disable an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking interface .
speci@@ fies the computer &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net that transm@@ its the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network where the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a host with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers only use IP addresses . if the machine requests htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS resol@@ ves this name into an IP address , such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the BAE name resolution calcul@@ ator allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . entries can be added , removed or altered by selecting an entry and desc@@ ending or down@@ grading in the list with the buttons up or down in priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the nam@@ ing solution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the nam@@ ing solution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... The Edit dialog will appear .
the name of the name known by name describes the host@@ name to IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting if there are no DNS servers available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list contains some known calcul@@ ators some entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this is still to be replaced in the test version of IP in future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be added .
enter the name of the known calcul@@ ator and click the Add button . if the known calcul@@ ator has several alias names , press the button Add multiple times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog to edit your computer will be shown .
it may be one of the following tasks executed , then clicking on OK will update the list of static hosts .
settings made in the network settings are not effective immediately in the system . to activate the changes must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; the following command is set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of bin@@ ary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; using rpm as follows :
alternatively a tool can be used with graphical user interface like k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages with libraries and other things are needed .
this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do so .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic network technology , in the second section , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ conf ; changed configuration files .
this section cannot replace further knowledge on IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found any major distribution . IP@@ v@@ 6 expects that it will prevail in the near future . therefore , this description is currently concentr@@ ating on the common IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , am &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact point , which is either a valid IP address or , if available , can be used D@@ H@@ CP . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily !
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded on the Internet , so any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks mostly addresses are used in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP forwar@@ ding .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . usually , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed dynam@@ ically , so that it will not be surprised if there is any other content to be found in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another level than expected can therefore occur .

it appears the default k@@ de ; -@@ printer dialog . if you choose to fold out , see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog .
print the cr@@ ont@@ ab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own advanced per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the cr@@ ont@@ ab command to change the user sched@@ ules .
a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; for example , with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it provides the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a surface for tar which presented the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to fast , selective ex@@ cre@@ ment . the second goal was to answer a question my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you backup ?
before a tape can be used , it must be done by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; how@@ l the band back and read the pre@@ stres@@ sing information of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t know the pre@@ sp@@ ann on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ sp@@ ann , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if this is not found , you will be asked if the index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes , in order to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched by opening the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration needs to be resolved first . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change of the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be disc@@ arded without danger .
before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a strip @-@ type must be format@@ ted before you can use to save data . this process does not correspond to the format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive assumes that a tape can be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted by the tape . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually do not require format@@ ting the tape , DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band@@ name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the belt is lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you hit the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . it can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is saved .
select a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select in the View menu ...
once the backup is started , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog you can check again the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you have confirmed the settings dialog , the dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the record for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu item ...
once the check procedure has been started , the dialog will appear for checking . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the work@@ bench for checking .
if you have confirmed the settings for the check , the dialog appears to be checked . this dialog displays the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can re@@ direct the recovery , the files that are to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Edit menu ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog box will appear for recovery . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the work@@ book for recovery .
if you have confirmed the recovery settings , the dialog will be restored . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to re@@ build the tape file based on the belt content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re@@ build the index on two types of tape :
this creates a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured automatically is updated automatically according to the selected working folder .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , only the files contained in the same file system are stored on the same file system as the folder . folders that are located on other file systems can be included separately from the backup files . each entry is considered by tar independently of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only those files that have changed since then .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up using the K@@ D@@ at menu item ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ winding version of the belt device .
if this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is mounted the command mt load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the ej@@ ection during tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , when rele@@ asing &amp; k@@ dat is checked , the tape will be ej@@ ected automatically . do not use this option with flo@@ ppy Stream@@ er .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size will be communicated to your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover a block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID will be used to find a file with the same name in the $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat file folder .
the rest of the files on the tape are tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is mounted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ Log ; experienced users provide quick access for example on information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system lays down the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users give quick access for example on information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced features that can be fil@@ tered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen@@ shots , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available , with which help to filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will open . if this is not shown , and it will open instead of it a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or according to entered strings . the list of the log lines is now automatically changed , so only the log lines will be displayed , so that only the log line displays the entry all . then a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns contains the string of the filter search term .
you can also select another entry at this point . for example , the string of the filter search concept will be offset only with the entries in the correspon@@ dingly selected column . for example , in the protocol file system protocol , select the name of a process , so you can see &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level error are displayed with a more con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous color as protocol lines of the level indicator . the colored display of protocol lines can be switched to setup dialog .
if you want to show only certain process ( for example in the system protocol or in the Cr@@ on protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can switch to new lines in the main window &apos;s context menu to display all new protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a log in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own web page on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. there you will find more information about the source sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; in addition , you can find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; files
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named after ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it is quickly becoming a standard for controlling the program start @-@ up system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not deal here further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the in@@ it bin@@ ary file is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine on System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ting . therefore , you must ensure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service you want to boot when you run the system or switch to another Run@@ level . system Services do not include such things like network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , on the other hand , do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls are according to r@@ c.@@ local .
most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel tries in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one to find .
the standard run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . in the beginning , you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . if you have something to change , then you will repair it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and execute the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written so that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line :
this would stop the htt@@ pd server . in@@ it reads the name , and when it includes a K , the script will be called stop with the argument . if it contains an S , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; have a server running level running only htt@@ pd , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user Run@@ level , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of Available system services to one of the six levels to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or move the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . this only happens if you pull out an entry from the range of Available system services .
note : entries will be moved if you are drag@@ ging them into a new area . to only copy it to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly choose Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste in the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : there is currently no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to enable the different working areas ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) and the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones .
to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with cutting to the clip@@ board ( you can also use Ctr@@ l ; X ) and paste it into the desired running level with paste ( using Ctr@@ l ; V ) .
to manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry , press the Enter key to change the Properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ D@@ ED@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise , changes to the pres@@ ets are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ e vel@@ ing , and now the machine is constantly rest@@ art@@ ing . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press Enter key to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; designed for running Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services in these distri@@ butions are started simplify the configuration for the proprietary setting programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan to extend the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all the configuration files are available ( and whether they are located in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ pd ) are simply termin@@ ated without notice if their configuration files are not present or wrong .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even vary from version to version . if you are using any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the entry in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog for user / group properties .
some card cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only when you activate space constra@@ ints ( Qu@@ ota ) for users will create a card tab on which you can make individual settings . additional card cards appear if Shadow -@@ Pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes .
the card card password administration appears , if shadow pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes .
this tab card only appears if for at least one built @-@ in fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( identi@@ fiable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the restrictions in KB are :
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected with the help of the file system with space limitation
the card group inform@@ s about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group , which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member of other groups by marking them in the large field .
the dialog properties tab contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works analogue .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO @-@ Boot@@ Manager to add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the standard operating system , add the default operating system , remove , modify operating systems , remove , change , and more .
