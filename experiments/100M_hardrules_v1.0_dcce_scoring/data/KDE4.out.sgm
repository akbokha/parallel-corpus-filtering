<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated to the whole & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. babelfish is in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated to the Babelfish page by yourself, where you can paste text directly to translate text.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains various modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making them easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">For more information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in the & konqueror; choose settings to set up settings.... Open the card tab tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard setup modules from the package kde; addons. please note that any more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in the & konqueror; on extras crashes. then you can view the page, which has brought & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes if any.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module connection filter (also called Folder Filters) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras address Filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; you can filter the current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Tools DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: the documentelement, all other knot are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents another view of objects with the MIME type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each object is represented by a rectangle whose area is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">In & FSView, the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder, with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily detected even if it is far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore & FSView can be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the tremor representation a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles feature meaningful shade and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over view color mode can be either depth for the easy recognition of the nesting depth or the illustration of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the respective file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if sufficient space to display is present or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used (and thus representations caused by restrictions on the character of the treble). furthermore, you can set the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">At display algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed, that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry. it is not always observed at the tremor in & FSView; frames are drawn to avoid the nesting of the entries. note that less space for the frame is lost if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to partition the surface of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. hereby it is possible to divide the areas in such a way that rectangles develop, which are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive second release.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can define the minimally presented area for an entry through the menu entry view on surface. instead, a room pattern is drawn into the surface of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget, which was developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and your photos directly in & digikam; -albums can be downloaded. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course, any media and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam; together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; includes fast image editing with basic image processing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. editing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE Image plug-in interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it operates completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion using libraw, DNG-export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with considerably more metadata, such as & eg; over the camera or lens, which can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digikam; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. they should therefore report problems and improvements.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digikam; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easily as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. all required information is already entered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to answer you questions to other users of & digikam; in this mailing list, however English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digikam site to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digikam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get involved is the registration in the developer mailing list. guidance for logging in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you exit & digikam; for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database. simply enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here the data storage is saved. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want to add. & digikam; will also use as a Albenlibrary. settings digiva set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder, the images, as base folders. & digikam; regards each subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; durst recursively the library path throughout its depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders unless it is in hidden folders. this allows you to add extravagant & digikam; by placing one point in front of the subfolder's name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as base folders, you will notice that the albums in My Albenlist do not have photos as symbols. you can change them by using any photo from the album and using this on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can enter & digikam; you can set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My albums and my keyword list to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, then & digikam; possibly also deal with it. the support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help Desk Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in sections Roh decoder settings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and your photos directly in & digikam; -albums can be downloaded. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course, any media and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam; together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera will then be used as a disk drive. the connection can also be realised via Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses the gPhotos2 program to communicate with digital cameras. gPhoto2 is a free, distributable software collection for digital cameras, which has an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhotos2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support to read the thumbnails from digival. Exif support is needed by some libgphoto2 camera drivers to read the thumbnails. if the Exif support is not in libgphoto2, you may possibly need to see thumbnails or the creation might be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things on & digikam is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image plug-in interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digistered; by writing a small module to add a function than the changes in & digikam; themselves perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to fullscreen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drawing and dropping images works everywhere: you can lay a picture in another part of the Albenbuild, over the horizontal dividing line or into another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in terms of keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file selection allows you to extract the most common ones: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. so the filename works only if this is a symbol view. which fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog box settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos, which were written by & digikam, are stored in a single nightmare. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the Albenproperties or after the date on which the album was first created, sorted. the date can be changed to the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have a scanner set up, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select Album importer pictures. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. select Album importer screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then pop-up menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move it to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features to give you information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select album Properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album- Collections: are a method to mark your albums, so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos if you want to add or delete new collections. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the collections for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view Albums According to date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The knobs eldest, average, new ester: these set the date on that of the oldest, the most recent image or that of the average of the album. to do this, first attempt to compute the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first open an album in & digikam, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; Meine Albenlistequot; sometimes the first picture in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, you need to click on the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu & quot; Select. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be recycled.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the My keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all the images in this album will appear in the image window. each photo will be shown in a preview, you can customize the size of this preview with the two magnifier balls in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait briefly while the thumbnails are generated. this can be avoided in which you can use all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image will be shown below the thumbnails. what information these are, you can change settings. choose here the albums Page and customize the area preview images to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. the help displays the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Pictures and keywords allow you to organize your images in a way that suits you. image editing displays your photos and allows you to create a number of improvements to them. you can view all the features that come with & digikam; you can choose between viewing images, slideshow or editing images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by calling either F4 Edit... or the right mouse button menu. in the digikam, image editing pane, you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos. with the image editing, you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub-menu of opening. to do this, and how to adjust it to your needs, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs can come to problems with the metadata that is contained in the picture. some programs do not store this data with when you save the modified image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digikam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way to click on the preview and select Drews. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the filename of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you keep the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digikam, it will be moved to the trash bin of & kde; moved. F8 image deleting or Del If you prefer to delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The view & quot; My data list quot; organizes your photos based on the data. & digikam; use either the EXIF date or if it is not available, the date of last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the image view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown to you.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provided a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. by this, you can logically organize your keywords. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyword queue; work together so that you can find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs. in addition, the keywords in the loss of database re-imported, once & digikam; the pictures are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by clicking on & quot; My keyword; or click on an existing keyword and then choose a new keyword. if you have clicked a new keyword after you have clicked on an existing keyword, this is the keyword for this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and deleting. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword is removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and place there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can only be once in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking the right mouse button and edit the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword; change.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, you must click the right mouse button and select in the context menu As album preview. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To use & digikam; s functionality with keywords to use, you must first name your photos with keywords. this can be done in two ways: as soon as you have selected the photos, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword; drag and drop them there. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can indicate a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be shown as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can give a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have signed a photo with keywords, this will appear in the main window when you preview the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword by using the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and remove from the keywords menu. the menu displays only the keywords assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a time-dependent adjustments of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a timeframe you just have to click on the lower right of the selection frame, which indicates the time unit.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. it will then appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Next to the search box is a small lamp the green will be when the search hits. if you click here, the filtering is deleted and all the pictures are shown again. if the search has found nothing, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The advanced search tool is hidden in the rider on the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you can open this you get a simple search box as described above. you can save this search here as a live search, which always filtering what you entered as search criterion. after you have been stored, it appears filter in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are happy with your selection, press the OK button and the search is performed. the results will be used in view My search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after searching, you just have to select the corresponding entry from the View List pane and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you choose to edit search, the form to enter the search will appear again with the search information previously entered. if you select to edit an advanced search, the dialog will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search. here you will find more rules for the search.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search will provide you with an extended search form with many search options, with which you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatenbank. each option can be added to the search group by operators. each option can be added to this list by search group / search group. each option can be linked to others via the logical operations All..., One..., No... or at least... can be linked. in addition, you can create searches of type & quot; AND NIGHT.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterized each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows images to be compared by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two visual signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar. if you push a picture from somewhere on the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand color sketch: draw a fast sketch and & digikam; find the matching pictures. also here a swelling value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive pattern search tool available based on the Marble Miniature. you can zoom in or out or move it. drag it while you press the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to move a square. all pictures within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this naturally presupposes that your pictures contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. it will then be added for later use in the list below. it works like a live geoip.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides a lamp in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, also raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Dem Lighting Table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the lightbox and opened its window.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the thumbnail, you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window and place there. a small arrow tells you which copy in which window pane can be seen. if you can preview thumbnails from the toolbar and perform a zoo or move operations on one of the pictures, then these are also executed on the other picture. you can therefore compare the same area of the two pictures.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series. if you navigate pairs from the toolbar, then the first two images are automatically loaded into the areas for comparisons. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to display it on the left. this makes it easy to work through a number of similar pictures.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletions also work directly from the lightbox like e.g. F4 File Editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumbnails. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you see at the crossed arrows. in order to pivot the visible area of the image, you need to click it and hold the & LMB; then both images will be shown in the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works just like in other views. just use the zoom slider under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images if you are viewing in the mode Preview.</seg>

<seg id="147">& quot; Digital stock management takes up, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, terminates and exports content to a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is stored in accordance with your definition data, information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare say if you find more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you do not even need to find a specific photo without inventory management. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you certainly do not use & digikam;. the approach to save metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving on which you can access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure unlike data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you have to decide whether you want to save other access to your photos if you want to save them to a dedicated drive or on a network drive & etc. keep in mind that you have to switch to a larger drive sometime.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be found quickly about your location unless you were in one year several times the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% of archives and 5% of work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files facilitates a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata to save the metadata in & digikam site. this ensures EXIF- and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the relevant item in the menu item.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change it? to do so, & digikam; you have a metadata editor available for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, as you should now select keywords, captions and an evaluation. of course, you can select all the images that require the same attribute and then set the value.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now talk with keywords, keywords, as you frequently wish to say in other programs or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import cataloguised images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically rearrange the tree for you or insert the images to the right place. the re-sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a sub-tree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata overlaps. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keyword - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to cataloging your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anyone see your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. you are sure how your photos will arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from far away is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say that this is the landing field of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you begin to dream, associations to have memories, the historical period of time is again present, you might even hear the silence. so the lettering has completely changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you are moving about what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a lettering for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), as a label. KDE will even provide you with a spell checker. if you export your images in web galleries, then these labels will be exported to your wishes in the label and / or the title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to go to another city without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet in Google Earth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation already travels with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of exploiting geolocation are already innumerable and will be deeper in the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your journeys using pictures with geographic data. & digikam; can also export kml files that you can open with Google Earth. you can also export the images to Gallery2, picasaweb, Flickr & etc, with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a pun with copyright and denotes the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all modified versions, i.e. also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the setup side of & digikam; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the photographer's name, for example, the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autotitel (synonym for author line): associated with the author. this field contains the photographer's job title. examples of this can be titles like: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who works the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations can be listed here, which offers you the picture to others. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group / agency that offers the picture offers here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they have no protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculators can delete or modify them in the image. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digikam; in the near future it will provide such a module for batch processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate errors, Plate loss, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, widespread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. this kind of losses are the same that can also happen in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section we are dealing with problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTrack, the world's largest data recovery agency, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these cautious can be treated and you can no longer be trusted than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer to get harder and much more expensive. there are offers about gold-coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that claims a lifetime of 100 years for themselves. whether you believe this is in your discretion.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliably.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if you have just written it. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they are aging through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster which appears to be a miracle in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but it is not available for Macs. there are also similar applications read the damaged disks from damaged disks, hard disks, flash drives, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also true for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriate format. also read the media with a description, date & author and then store them in a clean, dark dry and protected spot. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Diskmanufacturers retain their stats for themselves. their manufacturer's warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives available:</seg>
<seg id="187">Some of SMART errors are the most common error cause, SMART can not detect this error. some of SMART errors notice the imminent failure. these are especially lesbikers and publishing counters. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files, but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric appliances do not make a lot of electricity, this can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high-speed processors. they can cause severe damage to your computer. thus, you can cause these anomalies to cause complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboards and other defects. thus, protect yourself from the unavoidable result resulting in a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current tips is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. remember, however, that not every connector bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection then you should ensure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also take care that it provides protection against lightening and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that even all peripherals connected to your system are protected. some manufacturers also provide voltage support, which also includes a telephone connector for your modem. others offer connectivity for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks, and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from smaller fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore make sense to invest in a non-interruptive power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against surges, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. this gives you the possibility to save your data and run the system safely. if you purchase a USV then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare its safety with the costs of avoiding these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W USV can be used for less than & euro; 40.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data over the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are stored on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the perspective of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. due to the TCP protocol, transmission errors are automatically adjusted and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory. thus, they are disaster-proof.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the calculator. all transmissions are susceptible to transmission errors. the ZFS and btrfs filesystem must at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst part is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you have to open a photo one day and this is to your surprise. no one seems to have ever thought about it. no one seems to have ever thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, since they generate interferences within the data streams. with normal filesystems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard on a GPL. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in the Alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms the ZFS is used and is also available for & Linux; it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% for workstation systems. for notebooks, the share of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to a lower damage than for example theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source filesystems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the distributed file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. this means that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deteriorates. a sensor size of 6 megapixels and a high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard disk today for 100 & euro; so do not blame anybody else for data loss. so, backup your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you make any more dangerous than re-installing your operating system, the replacement of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make daily your backups on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash hit you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. don't forget your airplane crash: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore disaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, to the neighboring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time at which such backup has been made. this backup comes to a versioning system the next one with the exception that it is only getastet and not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that have really changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Save important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or any other visual media.</seg>
<seg id="225">At the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, stored in the image file, stored IPTC information, associate XMP files, original retain, store, scalability, media, retrieve images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing equipment..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable images will survive the next 40 year that is about the period in which you really are interested in because you remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate while the time goes. unfortunately, there is no other way than a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible. the fewer variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the professional print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this means actually increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability with and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and store it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the dmesg command to see if your new record was detected by the system, but do not hang them.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # changing the size of the reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software available to read, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been designed as an open source standard designed to replace GIF. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG may have relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF needs and has a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF could be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (DEFLATE). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras, you can store your pictures in this format. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a licensed and open frame format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is required to use metadata. a handful camera manufacturer puts DNG right now and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Educsible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a labelling technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; saved for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers move it before an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format, to archive. XMP adapts as it stores metadata separately from the image file. however, it may cause problems when you link between the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include the work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI Working Groups, Annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and informative efforts to achieve far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera graph, you can use it as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them to your raw archive. this feature is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">You can use external programs for fine editing. if you edit the images again with & digikam; then you should add the metadata again. these were cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them into web galleries, code in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; in the Adding a Photos to an Album you will find a description how to add photos you already have on your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your Albany database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digikam; to use, connect it to the computer, turn the camera on display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not show thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the file association settings are displayed for each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the side bars features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image is not yet downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras are not available for all information.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab Metadata displays the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as in the Metadata page bar from the main window of & digikam; or image editing. note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection from all. this loads all photos from your camera into one album in & digikam;. downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all the photos, you can select only the desired & kde selection methods. once you have selected the photos, you can download the download button and then download Selected.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New is available. these images have not yet been downloaded from & digikam; in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you select this option, only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">The list of the existing albums is shown, how normal folders are sorted, displayed. the list of the existing albums is shown, how normal folders are sorted, displayed. then select the list of records from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digikam; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by deleting the Delete All. if you only want to delete some, then you must select it first and then delete selected deleted files.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera. so you should carefully check whether the photos were successfully downloaded into a & digikam; album before you want to delete them from the camera. if you want to delete them from the camera, you should do so using the camera location, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras are often used as filenames for the photos often not very meaningful names. the filenames are usually used again after the photos were deleted from the camera. this can result in double filenames if you load photos from different recording criteria into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was taken into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based baskets. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically.</seg>
<seg id="263">The first two affect the data about the author in the Standard Autoridentity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix for example:% M:% S in the edit box. turn the option date & time. for more adjustments, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file name, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase letters or uppercase letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digikam; for a photo used, is shown below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window the next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the point of time recording to perform an automatic rotation during download. not all cameras provide this information. in the section Head Metadata section, you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, & digikam; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available, & digikam; this use to automatically load sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information. in the section header Meta data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case, & digikam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the Advanced Folder option on the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select Upload. the file selector dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & digikam; you where the pictures are to be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. thus, a position is meant that can be displayed in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographic location. not everyone uses an aircraft to map an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forgot to forget where exactly the photo was done, you can click a browser to display the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digikam; users who want to locate the location of the photos, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to add the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and map references. there are at least three ways to reach this. directly with the correct hardware, via a post-editing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic assignment (manual) and most recently by manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as a map module or by transferring the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save this data in the gpx format as this is the only format supported by the module for geographical allocation.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the privileges to be created for example by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European road maps. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam; try to give as much control over its workflows as possible. there are many settings that the behavior of & digikam; change. to access these settings, you must specify in the Settings menu. the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded previews or editing image editing. you specify the default behavior of & digikam; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option is selected for downloading from the camera interface. also in database synchronisation, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autotitel is a synonym for headline: this field should include the professional designation of the photographer. this can be descriptions such as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for vendors: use this field to specify the image that the photo offers. this does not have to be the author, if this is a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here, as this is the picture of another & quot; offer & quot;. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group or agency should be enumerated here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC-actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC field. this achieves that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of & digikam; these metadata also contains other programs and can be imported into & digikam; imported without lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image labeling as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments that you add to your photos, with the labels embedded in the pictures. this allows your captions to be read from other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse pointer in the main window is over a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digikam; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; display, you can add and remove the extensions of this list. any file in one & digikam; albumfolder that has none of these extensions, from & digikam; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Update to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the lightbox from & digikam can be set on this page to the default values. each time you open the lightbox, these settings are switched on. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. the option & quot; In all the image size you can only use on fast machines. if you have one, then you can get better view results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn on the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposure areas of an image can be marked with darker or light color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in the image editing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma subsampling is meant that the images can be encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia about the nearer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG-compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not decrease the image quality, as PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast machine, you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files, you can switch the DEFLATE compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality, since the DEFLATE algorithm works loss-free.</seg>
<seg id="299">Loss-free JPEG-2000 files can save you loss-free. even if you select the lossless settings, the ratio of quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not supported yet, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digikam, image editing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it develops very quickly to a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default acceptance is that all green pixels are equal. if you react more sensitively to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference produces a mesh pattern in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option draws the picture a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern using the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard is to use a solid color balance that was photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposure images in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is it the pointed, so the parts of your pictures are burned into the settings, because of the inability of your camera to catch the snuckers, as transparent white. the setting colors cause some unusual results since it shows the pointed-lights in various rose shades. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally don't satiate as quickly as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you get the option to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the luminance value to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & digikam; image processing. to keep the time for the demo icing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive homogeneity-Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it produces color bars on the edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can put the red and blue proof values here. this is certainly the best method for a softening correction since you are carried out during crude conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates colour information and gives instructions on how they should be returned. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information on how to translate colour information from a color space to the other, so that the colors are as exact as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behaviors ask questions when an image is opened in image editing / color administration module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Sets the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles. & digikam; examine this folder then during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility & quot; default squot; for your profiles to be deposited. everything can be changed later when the raw file is opened.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here, only your pictures are color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">Not all profiles are created in the same way. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some such as Canon, which do not contain colortonic mapping or gamma correction. currently dcraw Gamma does not correlate to conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to perform the grafic mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof profile that you can emulate how your image would be returned from a device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated. this could be corrected manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it's pretty obvious which colour profile is intended for what is intended for. unfortunately, not in the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course inofficially:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a series of & kde; image viewer and image editing. by deploying this interface, & digikam; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and these will then be loaded by & digikam; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window and in addition you will find some examples in the context menu of the preview window.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slideshow should be easy to understand. the upper regulator adjusts the time between the frame transitions, normally 4-5 seconds is good. the other check boxes turn the metadata into or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera properties show on the left a list of all the currently supported cameras. on the right side there is a button Auto Detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, switched on and in image display mode. below are the port settings. currently, there are serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, where you can mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use & digikam your digital camera; you need to connect the camera to your computer to bring and turn them into the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try whether & digikam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can manually set camera model and port. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera's menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the main window pane of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving pictures in the trash bin, you can indicate the conversation of & digikam; when deleting a photo in an album. in the sections of deleting a photo and deletion of an album you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right side bar can be tacitly used by & digikam; if you use the option to apply changes to the right side bar without any queries, otherwise you need to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the welcome screen from & digikam; in case of stopping, this accelerates the starting process of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting When starting new pictures forces & digikam; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digikam;. if something dropped from the base folder, queries & digikam; you know if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be used in & digikam; to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam; you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digikam; includes fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use them to view and correct your photos and edit and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the Preview / Edit entry.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam; so you may not be part of your distribution. you will find more information about the KIPI modules in the image editing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most commonly used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file Save or the button Save from the toolbar. note that you can't restore the original photo once you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save this with file Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by restoring it from the File menu or using the button The Recover of Image Processing in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of image editing can be reversed or restored. you can undo the last action by selecting Edit Background or restored by selecting Edit Remover from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should use the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z to undo and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB on the toolbar button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions will also be reversed and restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started image editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can zoom into the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the menu toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select a magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come in the normal view where you can use the Esc key. normally, you can change this in the Settings dialog from & digikam; you can change it from the & digikam; main window. see the section for setting image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can choose to print the image in the File menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sets. entire image thumbnails can be selected from your selection. you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select from the menu Album Export printer wizard. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digikam; main window has a side bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same side bar is available without the navigation path, also available in image editing. it will appear when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same rider allows the sidebar to appear or go back to the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label view, you can enter inscriptions with unlimited size or insert. note the note down. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labels are copied to the EXIF- and IPTC fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are reversed. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it, use either the button Apply or simply switch to the next picture, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the Application button, you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this will always be done when you have chosen a metadata setting which is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field of urgency. the encoding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree, and a selection box containing the keywords used previously at this & digikam; session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a picture series. if you have typed different keywords, they are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the corresponding boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If you select multiple images in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only apply to the highlighted picture and not the whole selection, if you want to use a keyword, please read the section keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword filter is used to change the selection of pictures displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar with their album, - date, stitch and search results is used. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right, only the intersection of these two will be displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and place keywords. suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view to use keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right side bar and put it to the selection. then a dialog box that asks you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three pictures. they were selected with Ctrl + a, and then a keyword was drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and placed there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have created and created a rule and find that it should be one or one, you can easily change it by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is searched. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set a Advanced search for all the elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why have picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digikam; s specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web which correspond to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the subject comes to color management, then everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, colour management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflows. the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, then you do not have to worry about color administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see further information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are via e-mail or the web, where sRGB is the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB is so good working and makes life easier for everyone, why should one use another color space and thus have to think about color pantages?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB's limitation compared to the colors we really can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger paint booths, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and first click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to caly my monitor if I decided to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in a sRGB colour space or not, you need to calliy your monitor since sRGB is callized on sRGB, then you either need to calliy your monitor to sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, please use it before you attempt any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, compensate, automatic synchronization and contrast extend from the menu of the Automatic Correction menu automatically trying out of your colors the best. you'll have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminous values over the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its shade. this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or well-washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">This method adjusts the brightness of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity can be as flat as possible. it sometimes produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that causes miracles in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and light tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a realignment of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance from & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited to a colour space with 8-bit per color. so if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu item Color White Comparison of Image Processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side both the original image and the preview of the target picture can be seen. the preview is dynamically adjusted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again then it is enough to click on the sub-window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The thumbnail preview has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the right side, a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful there, even in well lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminanz.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or dim the shots of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then click anywhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the colour temperature of the white balance. in this way the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one colour channel is overexposed. you will see the combined result in the white balance. this is shown as pure indicator in the preview and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and load exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button sets all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in another photo as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this encoding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be performed by the sub-window for the brightness. a detailed manual for the use of color profiles can be consulted from chapter colour management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under Color Sound correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to save your settings at the same time. this is useful if your camera or scanner always need the same error and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find in color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digikam; tool color effects provide you with four color effects, a Solarisationseffect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canteen filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation was also called Sabatier, an effect that resulted in a partially developed pressure from the additional light. this had the effect that lighter areas were darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. the result was a partial negative of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">Intensity controls the solar system. at about 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. a further increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photopaper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy effect. the original image is the (1) and this is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid-filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellishes a lot of photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therewith a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts. Velvias are strongly saturated color but also some photographers, especially those that barely clear landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates Neonlight on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sliders repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large pictures, the filter can weigh the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to adjust the color contrast and the luminosity of the photos. you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem: one too great saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. all changes you can carry out can be viewed in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex mould Gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool is based on sound correction to improve exposure. even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated, you need only the range of sliders explained here. more concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three sliders are clicked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate is to shift the controls and make sure the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is updated dynamically, based on the settings of the picture. the following options are available on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it is possible to set the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear representation is most useful. in pictures the large areas of a constant color are dominated the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three regulators: the top one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds, often called Gammavera.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows, middle and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is one button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls that can be used to edit the output values interactively as in the input rate. the compression of the output values can e.g. be used to create an extended image as background while something else in the foreground is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: using these buttons, the set values in the filesystem can be saved and loaded later. in addition, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shadows, means and sun-tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminous channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target picture will be displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right hand side, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifiziere channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel which changes from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Beside this box there are two icons to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera, linear mode is most useful. for pictures with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and the corresponding image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original pictures you can see a red marker. if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve that you created can be saved in the filesystem and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, medium and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you will get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo corrected in the LuminanzChannel. shadow and sun-tones were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel-mixer of & digikam; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">The channel selection box lets you select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left pane of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed as compared to your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture a vertical line in the histogram will show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: regulators for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminanz, the image will retain the general brightness as the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colouring. colouring consists of small diamond arteads that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and their smoking patterns in each channel are different. if that is the case, you can improve your Monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and store buttons are used for this purpose. any blender setting can save you later and then load it. the file format used is the gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re-adjusted. the Luminanz option is checked. the original image is shown below (1) and the modified image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / White photography has always been fascinating for your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step because color images can be easily converted to the machine. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green Filter: simulates a black / white fillet light with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangefilter: simulates a black / white fillet light with an orange lense filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red Filter: simulates a black / white fillet light with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic canopy effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at the time of the day. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Gel Filter: simulates a black / white fillet light with an yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) gel filters.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm light and middle sounds while adding a bit of cold in the shadows. this is very similar to the process of leaving a pressure and the redevelopment in a septile. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digikam; mold texture, you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it's a color image or not, you can look it like an oil painting on canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu item Image texture using image editing can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper texture effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the modified under (2) to see. the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digikam; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image. thoroughly cut the picture with a colored line, Niepce finishes it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), shkanty finishes it with a nice three-dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the print of the pictures, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into an image at any location. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text device, orientation, color from color space and character set with its properties as you need. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background. the image is ready.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digikam; using the tools template, you can place a template using a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template used in image editing can be used to lay stencils via a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to decrease the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to the & digikam; stencil data bank, just send an email in English to the & digikam; mailinglist digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for first time, you need to set your stencil template with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you copied the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">Once the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view reflects the template folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder will update the templates toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="474">Previews are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge This button magnifies the picture below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this button reduces the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to reduce the image appropriately. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be automatically adapted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but generates particularly in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">The sharpness mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it doesn't work a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitized images require a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalization process must be combined with only minimal differences to a color point. this, in turn, causes sharp edges to become a bit blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images, internal sharpness is often applied. images in the rough format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner already uses a focus filter while reading the image. if you disable this, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpness of the focus. you can call the focus on the menu item.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful, however, as the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool. you will achieve more information and comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture slightly softly is much easier than sharpening it. use the tool to soften the picture with the menu item, and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount intensify the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, the noise and the impression of graten will produce in the proximity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of a edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radii. therefore, you should best sharply view images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wired picture added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference of difference. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference thus for a edge of the filter. in this way areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharpening and hence beauty error in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masking filter. the original picture is the (1) and the edited picture (2). unsharp masking has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus refocused an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Entfaltungs-Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than trying to sharpen the picture. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filterung. the traditional technique for sharpening pictures is the use of a blur mask. refocus mostly better results than unsharp masking. you can start it from the menu by calling colors refocusing in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the palate's fold. the Gauß's fold has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also from the swelling pixels that are far from the original source pixels. in most cases, the FIR Viennese Inverse of the Gauß's Fitting is even influenced by the removed pixels. this causes undesired results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpening: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures, the default value should give 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very blurred then however on Heiligenscheine.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and values near 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0.03. a high value will even further contaminate the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche sharpness. this parameter is most often caused by a previously executed unsharpening filter. in most cases, you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the matrix matrix. an increase in die size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpening or the Gauß's sharpness. note, however, that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and store buttons are used for this purpose. any refocus parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cuts, color and intensity patterns on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible, which leave behind unpleasant artefacts later.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, & eg; than JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masks produce better results than sharpening. this could be caused by using blurly masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">In theory, unsharp masking must always create artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of unsharpening. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter. practically, the result of the FIR Wiener Filter is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unfocused color image needs to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpening in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator glazing sets the sharpness of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink tinted allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to avoid unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings fine you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed attitude p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a small value leads to an even smoother about the picture. if larger values are mainly homogeneous regions smoothen and let details focus sharply. a value of 0.9 should get details so that no sharpening is afterwards necessary. note that the detailed attitude should always be subordinated to the direction of orientation.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependency: alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a film gritt or CCD noise, a high value will generate waveform patterns. JPEG Artefakte is best removed with a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothness factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value appropriate to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects greater structures. the higher this value, the more is smoothed. this is necessary when a lot of noise is present, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is passed through. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular gradations [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, there should also be small selected. be sure that small angles provide a long runtime. thus, you should ideally choose this value and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stepping width [0,1, 10]: integral stepper width in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Using linear interpolation: the More to Quality that you receive by selecting this option is only low, but it doubles the running time. we recommend it to allow it to skip it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and load exactly this. any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Corrected image errors is comparatively very fast during work. however, it can take very long time and get a high CPU load after you move. therefore, you can break the calculation at any time using the button Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove image errors with Small Artefakte. the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artifact in the foreground that caused by a bad film shift during the trip. the original picture is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">Die & digikam; Rauschreduktion is a very powerful tool to reduce draughts. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove spots and other artifacts that come from dust or hairs on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensing noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings window can remain in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can wipe the image.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness. this value sets the pixel pitch the filter looks forward to pinpoint the brightness changes. if it is increased, noise points are deleted. you may need to adjust the edge filter if you change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication appears again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong cannot be removed all the noise or diamond tips can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance density: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either changing color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammating tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the darker areas, which are typically roughened to increase. however, it also contaminates the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjusting of the phase jitter attenuation. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother if it is too high, noise can occur. it can remove noise points and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used for this purpose. all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). noise reduction has been applied to default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool to soften the soft mark with the menu item Conducts softening and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">Die & digikam; Photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove palate, film grain, scratches, compression bars and local errors that appear in digital, original or retroactive digitized images. the smoothing takes place along the contours and thereby gets the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture creation. the texture creation is developed using another tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for the restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labs in Caen / Franna, and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefakte Reduction: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossless compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; artefacts; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and load exactly this. every setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo-restoration is comparatively very fast during work. however, it can take very long time and take a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can see like a photo with uniform noise reduction. the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a mint (tm) 700si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious movie grains on the faces. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected one (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures have been applied to an old color photo, which was scanned with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by the scanner illumination and the photopaper. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digikam; tool Hotpixel allows you to remove hotpixels from photos with a CCD camera gem, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are particularly problematic in high-quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark-image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you record the dark picture directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the right dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard notes the last dark picture and will automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help to correct the result inside the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to polish these pixels. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Thirst: an average of the adjacent pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear interface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to polish the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixelblock are drawn to compute a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to polish the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to polish the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">Die & digikam; vignettification correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposure corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not evenly illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances, which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should, also with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise blurring effects are created by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the wide exposure ranges of today's filtering and color or greyscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a raw image without this filter. the tool vignettification correction turns the transformation with a center filter on a picture. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers, you can control the vignettification correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light reinforcement at the point of the biggest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which compensates an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2,. increases the density by a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: the editing of an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the regulators only provide positive values because you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer adjustment of the exposure of the target image, let the values for luminous intensity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digikam; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignettification correction on a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a luminous and contrast correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortions can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect, but flat on the edges. this correction is not applied in the mold.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the coefficient is fixed to the remote corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. with negative values tonnenical distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion fourth degree. this value affects the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'corners' has the inverted character of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thereby reduces the first degree of cades. negative values increase while positive the image diminishes.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview will illustrate the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used at the next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonn- or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all trimming or size changes. best perform this correction as all the first. if you re-cut an image and then perform a tonnenical correction, the effect would be apparently the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to view the dotted lines. move the mouse pointer to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the tonn- / kissing distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a vertically distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove this with the cutting tool in the menu Transformer trimming from the image editing or using the zoom slider of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs like images from the front, frames and paintings makes it the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of tonnenical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared movie, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters of film gritt and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the Add film gritt option if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes colour channels for reproducing infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, since the colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infrared filming applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2) to see. the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the peak lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digikam; filter film gritt is an easy-to-use tool for reproducing film grain on your pictures. it is known from classic high-speed films like the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The image effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back to the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere of daily life. if you want this special, gallery-like, streetphoto, grainy appearance specifically in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although frequently higher values are needed to be set to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film editing effect applied to a black / white picture. the original image is the (1) and the edited version (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digikam; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digikam; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life-life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush is better suited for large images. flatten the smoothness or from the other side, the magnificence.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the machete is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoother 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digikam; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal sketch. images of their gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine which scene you had chosen to outline you. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digikam; filter engraving shapes your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digikam; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important on the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monochrome landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtration. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited picture (2). the depth used is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look like it is seen through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analog to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: wipe the picture along star-shaped lines that go from a central point. this simulates the sharpness of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often visible in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial sharpness: wipes the image by turning the pixels at a central point. this simulates the blur of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blur: wipe the picture to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to be back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blur: wipe the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blur of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blur: the image evokes softly into the dark and strongly in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shout blur: wipe the image by random shift of the pixels and thus simulates the blurring of a random moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Smart blurring: finds the color sink in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photograph into rectangular cells and then creates it through the filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural your pictures a wet appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn rightly protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. as the droplet size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digikam; image processing a area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to choose the area, e.g. a face that should stay free. if you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the edited picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can move it through mirrors or turning into the correct orientation. tools for this can be found in the Transformation Drews or transformation mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and hold the details sharply? how can you zoom in a picture when the boundaries of the resolution are reached? how can you invent or guess the missing information? how can you invent or guess the missing information? try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to change size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool for inflating.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Keep aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the new size of the original image is retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects greater structures. the higher this value, the more is smoothed. this is necessary when a lot of noise is present, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons save as and load are used for this purpose. a text file can be saved as a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast in what it does, but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles by magnifying a small picture of the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard augmentation compared.</seg>
<seg id="640">The image editing allows this very easy. to cut a photo you just have to use the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle while moving the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">You can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle. you can create a new rectangle by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The cutting button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the File Save or Save file from the File menu to save the newly edited photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the Preview pane you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be retained.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool According to the aspect ratio you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of height and width is assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">Cut the tool after aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. you can, for example, see a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically centering the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog you can set the max. ratio knob to the widest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After aspect ratio increases its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the modified image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the cut picture and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the composition help make it possible to fade help in order to make your pictures better together. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonious partitions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-level rule, harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in a similar harmonic triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden Mitte: the golden center is a division that is on different natural growth patterns, such as the spirals of a Nautilus sea shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we perceive as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden ratio is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who built your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden partition at all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where each number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two preceding numbers.</seg>
<seg id="654">The gold center provides liquid auxiliary lines when you put a picture together. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third level, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow through the image. this type of composition guides the viewer's gaze along the line of spirals and creates a symmetrical visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spirals. it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles are also derived from the above-discussed golden spiral. their vertex points are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to the harmonious triangles, golden triangle are not equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can be issued a static object dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use gold triangles to break down your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can not achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal mirror and vertical mirrors can be used to reflect the harmonious parts.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button paint you can set the color of the guides. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can become invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it's easy that you do not keep the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can do this with the rotate; image editing and the tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the default settings button, you can set the slider to 0 degree. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">Move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">Once you have filmed an image, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair this is to use the transformer trimming function from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic cut. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option smoothing the picture a bit after the rotation. but note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are carried out by a point of reference to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recharged. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including empty areas created by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including empty areas created by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right at the top: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left bottom: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a bit dirty. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adaptations generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you've adapted the perspective you get tightly triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformer trimming from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The scaling tool is used to shift a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite side. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module by transforming scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can shave horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press on presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will show you and the new dimensions of the target picture are displayed on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">Move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the scaling tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the picture is wiped a bit. for a single shearing, this effect is usually negligible, but two shearings generate twice as much evacuation and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After sheeting, the picture has unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transformer trimming from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam;</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats at this point. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; displays only files in formats that are aware of. this is done by means of file extension and a comparison of them with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, & digikam; you can change this list of file extensions that & digikam; you can change this list of file extensions.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select the format you want to use. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found on Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to save the image data to a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG with the same compression ratio.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read on Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digikam; in the section configuration section, you will find further information on how to use modules with & digikam;.</seg>

<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, soft marks, noise suppression, refocus, unsharp masking, & etc;. use a unified dialog type, which shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you can see & quot; Texture application-quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar indicates the status of the filter on the current image. left of it allows five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertically, without duplicates. the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected area.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontally, without duplicates. the upper part shows the original and the lower part shows the filter applied to the area below the selected area.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>

<seg id="707">'mouse over' style: shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview pane and otherwise the original.</seg>
<seg id="708">(2): there are two buttons that you can turn on to display over- and underexposure. the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page.</seg>
<seg id="709">(3): the frame to select the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place on the part of the image from which you want to preview. the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module are noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The page header features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo features: displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos. these data originate from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive pattern search tool available based on the Marble Miniature. you can zoom in or out or move it. drag it while you press the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to move a square. all pictures within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this naturally presupposes that your pictures contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for pallets files. the application can be used for processing color palettes and for selecting and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The pallets files, which are installed by & kde; can either apply to the whole system or only one user. in the latter case, they are in your personal folder for & kde; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the dialog box you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is shown as a line in the pallet view. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">The color is described under the pallet view. here also the color name can be changed.</seg>

<seg id="727">& kgraphinterviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -graphviz; -programs are free layout programs. & cographite; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & original; and & konqueror; (so that changing the graph in & nbsp; the graph new calculates and in & kdiagviewer; represented)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph; to open or to open the graph in & kgraphinterviewer; in a & b; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems from around 1000 nodes and a hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Additional required Software: & kgraphinterviewer; is a & kde; program which presupposes the & graphviz; -Tool & dot; for representing the graph. required in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in an own sub-window. at first, when you start & kGrapviewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) List has opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the bottom screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right at pressed & alt; -key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>

<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but can also change it with the Setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At the start of the program, you can open all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to divide the graph on several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using several pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph are to be placed on this page. the aspect ratio is ignored. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with one or more pages distributed without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewable Load page gives the option to set the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk, and eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore changes) or ask the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">Opening the page opens the possibility to specify the behavior of & kgraphinterviewer; specify when a graph is opened outside a current session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a sub-window of the already running session) or determine that each time is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session administration page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of & kgraphinterviewer; you can set a standard behavior (open or not open the files of the last session or not) or decide to be asked at each start afterwards.</seg>

Flickr is able to send photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world online, show photos of your camera and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The exporting module to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you will be guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. thus, it is virtually your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so you can log in to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr Website. you will be presented the following page after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after pressed on Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">If the module will start exporting to Flickr for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which shows the current permissions that the module indicates. you need write permission. the module currently does not support any other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button View Add Photos should be pushed once you have set any other options. using this button, you can select the photos you want to upload. if you click on the Ok button, the upload of the photos to Flickr server starts.</seg>
<seg id="803">The tags field can be filled with a list of words separated by comma. these are added to the image as keywords during the upload.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localisation allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data are stored in the EXIF stitches of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localisation provides tools for localizing images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographical data, you need a GPS Track as an XML file in the gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical Localization Korrelator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above-looking dialog then appears. in order to result in a possible correlation of time and location, you need to load a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were taken at the same locations as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When loading the file an automatic correlation shows the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS-time and camera time. the deviation below the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data of a location for images, you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all the images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolation and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have suitable data. if you know that in reality a location lies in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlated to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog opens the coordinates from one call to the next one, you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location may also be found and set with the displayed map. select the region in question and increase sie.Forect this again and again until you have reached sufficient accuracy. the height must always be manually selected. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that can be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The choice allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. the albums will not be displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below it will show the preview and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab displays the overall appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. the option for each image to create a page creates a new page where the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; kickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a sub-folder named KIPIHTML Export, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original pictures will also be saved in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth you can change the default color depth. naturally, this also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnails will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, which are small images displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the programs to determine if errors occurred during the creation. the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or shifting. the viewer can be used with short commands and folders. it has been designed for quick picture display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a windowed mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree Module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to store images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual losses of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size is rising, as no compression of colour information takes place. this can be found e.g. in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. attention: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then open the import function. this opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied after you click the OK button.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere but not to each target format. JPEG is supported in writing. please take a look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG encoder module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual pictures you can add a basic tutorial. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slideshow. using this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slideshow. after that, you can start creating the module using Tools MPEG Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures you selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio. you can also change the pictures or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are happy with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to play the file on a television, you need to choose the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds the one image is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value produces very sudden, a high contrast very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should let them black. the name and path of the generated file can be set in the name of the MPEG output file. keep in mind as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, then it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your wishes, you can start the creation of the movie with the button. depending on the speed of your computer you can now drink a coffee and enjoy the slideshow once you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages using the Settings button on the right.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo formats. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is for example: useful to improve you or print with the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import and convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to convert and start the module. the Raw image converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the button Preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for the white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the converting result. the filename stays the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are planning to manipulate your images frequently or otherwise, you should not choose the JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of surgeries before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start converting with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can zoom or enlarge the image. there are four types of image changes available:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size changes in one dimension. width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): change in size in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not Proportional: not proportional to proportions in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed in this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Presetching: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo apiker. the target image, including background size, marginal size and background color, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before. you can drag and drop additional images to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the image window will be displayed with the pictures you select. you can add more images to the left with a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and place it there to add you to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button images remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all the images, you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the OK button. you just have to add the addresses and the subject. the images you select are attached to the attachment.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't mind to send too many pictures at once. most email accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration will be saved and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After adding comments to an attached file, the comments to the images added to a text file are added and the mail is added.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format below the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best suited to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format, the original Exifdata will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is done, the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages, searching for errors. however, your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau there will be a window with questions like you want to show your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL option in the presentation will activate very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option displays the filename of the images in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a loop loop. you can then manually Cancel with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly choose to show that the images are displayed in a random order. thus, the sequence of images is not used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the pictures can be set between the pictures. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. by chance, each transition between the images selects another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse to this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date is currently no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. attention: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module uses the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have completed your pictures and videos with annotations, you can use & kphotoalbum; see picture. as you can see by comparison with the picture, are now available in each group, so in people, places and in group keyword entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have entered your pictures and videos with annotations. additionally there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">When using the mouse on the entry people, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the pictures shown on which both persons can be seen. through this selection method, you can restrict the number of pictures shown by a few thousand pictures to a few individual pictures.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, places and other settings, you can view with thumbnails to view the images of your activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail, which is of course also valid for places, keywords and other categories you have defined by yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images besides the names, select the button on the right side of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can view the view for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can display icons with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have appropriate images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">You must, however, select the image to display for each individual person. to do this, you need to open the image-view window (described in more detail) and in the context menu, you can select the image for the corresponding person. here you can customize the image for the corresponding person. in the view window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed and / or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you view searches in the main window, a dialog will appear, which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog once again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the labeling or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date, for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window, you can browse all the images according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here you can see pictures where Jesper, but not Anne Helene are shown.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user's manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals, but want to try out the same functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and watch the Quick Start, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo, if you start the first time, or select the photoalbum button in the Help menu. then some sample images are loaded and you can test the features of & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a related HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar you can see here:. as the name suggests, this list shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed thumbnail view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date will be shown in the preview pane) and also the timeline displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate to the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of timeline by holding the mouse button down and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select a range, in the preview view only images of this time period will appear. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a timeline bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; introduces two ways to create HTML websites with your images. the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as a module (see). the following part of the user manual is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version that you can create using the menu File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and destination. in the following, each section is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the moment and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML-Example-Pages you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file should be created on the overview page. learn more about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information displayed on the viewer even without a description. for example, that all pictures are from a party. note that all pictures are from a party. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why this is not addressed specifically.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. thus, those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no more images, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified, so it can scan your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time. if you want to get an image bigger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area, place the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best option is to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub-folder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if they really are all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created. the URL you set here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy it to it. so that the import function, see, correctly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the sub-folder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described above have all three related to base folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you may want to share your pictures with them. you can of course apply a HTML page to view the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. you can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images are stored in the file or if the file is only a shortcut to images. the advantage of saving all the images into the file is that you can have all the images together and can pass this file independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the File Export... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images found in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you have specified when creating the html files are searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can view from the File Export menu...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it's about internal or external .kim files. the following three options are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">You need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file with the Manuell option to the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Copy & paste the images automatically to the .kim file; the images are automatically copied for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to, just choose the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit image size. if you send images to your friends, you may not want to send the images in full size as the .kim file would otherwise be very big. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you import a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu... Select, will & kphotoalbum; import the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category of individuals of the file to be imported (if you are a domain) while this category is called for your database. therefore, in the third dialog box, you will be asked which categories of the imported file are to be imported and which categories they are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and watch images: if you look for pictures, you often want to see pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will pass the different steps of (1) to set the information about your images, via (2) the search and view, through to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; saves all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; notes the folder in which your images are stored and use it again with future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum; you can start another folder tree with pictures, you can start with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Using the menu item settings photoalbum; set up... come to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual we will explain the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed help is available, which you can call by pressing the F1 key and one click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the Options dialog, sub-categories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog box, you can set up complete groups of members, e.g. all members of a group at once in a group, rather than all groups of a member, as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the selection list you can select the category you want to configure. in the left side of the window you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digival and Gwenview. this module system means KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be invoked via the menu modules. the modules can and are not described in this manual as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can call through the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by multiple applications together, it may be that the modules with & kphotoalbum are tested only very little before you use them to use the demo database first before you apply them to your own pictures; Demo data base can be accessed either using the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't say, I wouldn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications are just a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this type of order doesn't support, it simulates for some modules the order after albums, so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all the pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Apart from the current album, & kphotoalbum; the modules also have to hand over a list of albums. here, & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you have set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums, for example, if you use the category people, will do & kphotoalbum; so do so if you have selected people to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start a photo album; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used from any other KDE application, you can see a menu and tool bar at the top. under the toolbar you can see the window that you can browse your image database. in the section we will view this window, but now click on the picture below to show you an overview of all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see any picture with annotations. this includes information about the people shown on the picture, where the image was taken, etc. you can either set any image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. for example, on all pictures Jesper is mapped and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these notes when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists with a text box by specifying persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to move the pictures within the list: if you have a family celebration, for example, and on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons are shown, you can, by the fact that the names used are moved upwards, the persons can find and arrange them faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetical sorted list, click on the symbol for sort by date on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and have these images with annotations. in this case simply click on the above and back buttons, which are located under the preview of the picture on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you've recorded several images, for example with the same person, it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item several entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as a subgroup. to show you that it is a hypergroup, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the catalogue, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it to a subcategory of this entry. attention, this requires that you just sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can shift the individual elements of the catalogue by clicking the bar, which form the top edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make your own window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options button, which allows you to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also hide a frame completely. if you want to display this window later, use the button Options... and then window one / hide. this can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select images in your browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all images in case you have no filter. you can configure the thumbnails, by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. just try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this will appear in the picture viewer. if you have not yet opened a window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the image preview. simply select the images you want to delete and press either the Delete key or select Delete from the Edit menu. now the window appears that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can also use & kphotoalbum; in fact, you can also use the images without you having saved on your hard disk. of course you need to save the pictures somewhere, so that & kphotoalbum; you can see the view from & kphotoalbum; if not all needed images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is truncated, are not stored on the hard drive. however, the thumbnails are present for pictures 5-9, so that & kphotoalbum; you can also preview these images with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy it back. & kphotoalbum; if you want to avoid annoyance, such as the confusion of your images, please buy a larger hard disk to store all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name Privacy. if you want a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end of those you want to make available for others and click on Current View locked in the menu item privacy. alternatively, you can also control all the pictures that your little sister may see, control and unlock the menu item All out of the current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have set out which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you give your laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu item pictures, which will fade out all the images you have blocked. if you want to get the pictures back, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password which must be entered for unlocking the images. to set up this password, simply change password in the menu item Privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe. on the one hand, all images on the hard drive and on the other can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who are with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar with the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you have all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with you to describe it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason & kphotoalbum; over an image _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in. it shows, of course, the picture, but additional information you have entered on the picture, e.g. who is on the picture, when and where it was done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox in the upper part of the image you want to see, you can easily drag it with the mouse and move elsewhere. you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed. all these options are available after a right-click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the infobox are underlined. if you click here, the browser, see the appropriate entries to this. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you load multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and picture down. you can jump to the first and last image with pos1 and end. these functions can also be accessed from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run it as slideshow; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new picture can be controlled by pressing Ctrl key and Plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; is it to be able to switch to fullscreen mode. in this mode the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you can use the viewer, you can drag and zoom into the picture. to zoom in, you can simply draw a rectangle with the mouse. using the Minus button, you can zoom in. the plus button zooms in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point key, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the equal button the zoom takes, so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations work with videos that are in and out with the Plus- and Minustaste.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotation functions from the context menu you can rotate the picture. this does not work with videos. you can comment on the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you will find an image with a person whose name you have forgotten on the image. at the moment you can view the view and open Configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you may prefer to select only the image and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you watch one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to add images with features while you view them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by using the corresponding letters. in the picture you can see a picture in which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">As soon as you have features on your images, these are available in your browser. so if you have all the images you want to edit, print or whatever you have selected, simply complete all the pictures you want. this is described in detail. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen. if you want to display categories in the preview screen, then you can add features to the images by simply press the letter for the attribute after selecting the image. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it's not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case, you will be allowed to draw on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image, but in the database. in the way you can reverse your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to see the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; on the image, select from the context menu. to finish the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the program & Povray; not fully control, but the documentation to & Povray; you should definitely read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the properties and the object is shown in the wire-modell- views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an already selected object, as all sub-objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the location on which you want to insert the object and click the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following drop-down menu appears, so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can delete selected objects from the scene with deleting either from the menu bar, or from the context menu of the right mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to accept these changes. if you have invalid values, a message is displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click on users or discard the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the Setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; -Reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press Preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a subordination item (for example a texture within a texture Map and not the entire texture map), check locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the camera control points. you can drag these points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire-model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a degree of visibility as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of sight of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects will only be displayed if selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the scene chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as desired. you can also save several windows orders and simply change between different orders.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then indicates the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the starter to the right or left side of a view. the new view will then be anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views over each other, drag the starter in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card-runner in the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window alignment are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to view a view from anchoring, drag the starter to the desktop or click on the small pointing arrow pointing to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view click on the small cross in the chamfering bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor it anywhere.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene you can render them rendern. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be correct. when this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the menu item View Tape.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View Render Mode menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense, but it is a name to detect the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box sub-section and enter the image editing to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality you can select the properties, the & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflections. a detailed description of the render features can be found in the user's guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel, various errors may arise. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step-effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the representation. this effect is called Aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of this error. generally pictures with this quality look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling involves the adjacent pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursively; recursively because each pixel is split again and again and adaptively because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray follows a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays each pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference between the values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixels are divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are followed individually and can be checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of recursion allows you to set the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process, called jittering. if you turn on jittering, changes & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card tab you can set whether the alpha channels are to be computed by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have not made an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly finished, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene file, select the menu entry File Import... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet complete command of & Povray;. when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you don't want to support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the property tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source text of the object into the open text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can paste source code for & Povray; also.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the property view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation for the displayed object. insert the path to your document and the version. the versions 3.1g and 3.5 are supported.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used to display the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window-type identifier.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the scope of the points to the Grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in more precise wire-model and therefore better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross High Detailed Search for advanced projections, all wire model views are further subdivided when the camera uses advanced projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to perspective and vertical projections. this property provides a better approach for projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you indicate a wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is represented in a checkerboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you indicate floor, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a checkerboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When you tick the edge, the non-recursive Anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. in the section Render-Modi you will find more detailed information about the parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the section window orders, it explains how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop-down box standard window arrangement: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window manders shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement using the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all the views for the selected window arrangement. you can create new views using the button Add and delete selected views with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column, create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten anchor the window under the existing window, with tab card you get a card-card view together with the previous view and floating the view does not anchor in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more exact knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball at one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window ordering:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation to get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Delete, so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice this in the fourth wire model view (right down). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the description of camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the View properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the button Apply or the Enter key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. for example, you could insert a charger (insert End Body Quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method of solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the property tree, change the name and then press the button Apply or Enter. in the property tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model view now also shows the level, albeit at the moment only as a limited finite level. if you render the scene renders, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree exactly, you will notice that you can fold the entry for the floor when clicking on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should shift the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. choose Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog where you can choose how to insert the object. please select First Subitem. the pigment will then change in the property tree. you can change the name in the property tree (name = bottom pigment), with a click on the button Preview you see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigments preview only shows a matt black material because you have to re-enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time by clicking on preview. now, there are many possibilities again, but now take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you see no color on the header and ball in the preview then click Apply button and then call the Preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is set right now. if you renew your image with one click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, these are not the color ones you have expected. here are additional settings necessary. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called One Color. then edit this entry twice (you can do this even more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select each time in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to do this step since you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be created just as simple as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget the input button or button Apply) so that the ball has contact with the floor. otherwise the ball would float above the ground, as you have moved the floor to a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now results in a strange result: as before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the following step, set a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as on the ground, give the sphere a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First Subobject and change the name for example in Pigment Pigment. click on the Pigment tab, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects when you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection already partly result in good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler; offers. hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracaycing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you shytracer a scene, the rendering of hypothetical rays originates from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) by each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this ray is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog can affect. thus, the scene pixels are processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the image is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog you can select a file that you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a storage space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu item can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last executed command. this menu item can only be selected if you have used Editing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing layout.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, shortcut and standard behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can modify or add new commands with this option for & kpovmodeler; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove commands with this option tool symbols for & kpovmodeler; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for both a bump map as well as for a texture Map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture Map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base, using an image file as color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the picture or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; it is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can display by clicking on & LMBn; or button Return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, just type the first character of the file name in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching file name is found, the file will be highlighted. you can exit the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>

<seg id="1160">& showfoto; tries to give you so much control over its workflows as possible. there are many options that can change the behavior of & showfoto; to access these settings, you need to set up the Settings button in the Settings menu. the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="1161">In the range of exposure indicators you can select the color displayed when the under- or overexposure indicator was selected. the colors with what you are supposed to display should be in contrast. underexposure should indicate a bright color and exposure of a dark color.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The main window of & showfoto; has a side bar at the right edge that provides you with important information and actions for the selected images. you can also find the same page bar in the image editing. you can view these in which you click on one of the five tabs:</seg>
<seg id="1163">& cannlite; is an application for scanning images that do not make more than images to scan and save.</seg>
<seg id="1164">& stream; is a simple application for scanning images that can no longer scan and save images. & stream; can open a dialog for each image or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format.</seg>
<seg id="1165">You can check the status of your scanner's support on the SANE project page by typing the information on this page: HTTP: / / www.sane-project.org / cgi-bin / driver.pl.</seg>
<seg id="1166">A standard scanner can be set in a terminal at the command line. if this scanner can not be opened or if no standard scanner is specified, then a dialog to select the scanner will be opened.</seg>
<seg id="1167">The user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner. Cancel will end & stream; Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1168">The other settings contain more detailed options of the driver. & cannlite; (libksane) does not treat these options particularly.</seg>
<seg id="1169">To view an image, the user can start a preview scan and then scan the scanning area for the final scan. the preview can be started by the preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1170">In order to better select the image, the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection. it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window.</seg>
<seg id="1171">If the image was selected then the final image can be read using the Scan button.</seg>
<seg id="1172">When previewing a preview in the settings is selected, then the image will appear in a preview window as shown below. when saving is pressed, then the image will be saved and sley? en leads to a demolition and you will get back to the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1173">The button settings dialog opens the dialog box in front of the main window. you can change the most important settings here.</seg>
<seg id="1174">The user can view the image if desired, before saving. in this case, the option must be selected before saving a preview. if this preview is not desired by the user, then the option must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="1175">This setting allows them to select the way & channels, saving images. open dialog for each image opens the dialog box in front of each scanned image. if & stream, then you need to save them with a generated name in a previously defined folder, then you need to choose saving without having to ask for a filename.</seg>
<seg id="1176">This setting defines where the images are saved when saving without having to ask for a filename. if the images are saved after each scan, then this folder will be used as default for the dialog for saving. the default is your home directory and you can change it using the button...</seg>
<seg id="1177">This parameter defines an image prefix for the automatically saved images and is beyond the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving. the automatically stored image gets a numerical suffix of each time a picture is saved. the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1178">The user can customize the image quality used for saving. this value also changes the compression value when saving. if Select the image quality is not selected, then the default value of Qt is used.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The button Help starts the KDE help with the & cannlite; manual. button Over starts the KDE over -Dialog for & float;. the button settings dialog displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end & stream.</seg>

<seg id="1181">& Amarok; used like any other keyboard shortcut. below you can set up a list of these shortcuts and their function. the global keyboard shortcut can be set by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and set the Global button shortcut to set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and set up short commands.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You may set up existing multimedia keys so they function as & Amarok; -Shortcuts work. by doing so, you make your keyboard to & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions, mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlists browsers and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports Qt and & kde command line options; additionally, Amarok has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use dialog to allow the user to know why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Korundum' rescue Loaderror error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop;, which each KDE installation should be included.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow remote programs and commands to execute. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this reason strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weis the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok sets the workload folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange Signalizing that a new piece is played. the script could now ask & zb; with DCOP functions for more information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newvolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: sub-menu itemNumber paths lists the path to the selected playlist files when a custom menu item is clicked. to remove the menu item, you can use DCOP function dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemame). to remove an entry you can use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemame).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to perform e.g. cleaning operations. this includes storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packets that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar-Archive (.tar) which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend an archive name like e.g. myscript.amarokscript.tar.bz2 so that the user can clearly see the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packets with the extension of amarokscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packages properly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script box is ready, you can attach it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki Scripts page of & Amarok; hang. for your entry on kde apps you should use the category Amarok; script.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok, you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus. maybe you're just looking for a certain title of thousands in your collection. with & Amarok, you will find it within seconds with & Amarok's collection browser and quick search.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but you can never decide which you want to hear? then the playlists browser is just the right thing for you. and if you still find it hard, select dynamic mode and smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. also, many different audio systems can be used, so YOU can choose how to listen to your music. this and many other useful features make Amarok the most advanced audio player. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right way to rediscover your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually, in the base folder of the Amarok sources you have to enter the folder to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automake used, you should have no difficulties when compiling. if you encounter problems, please report these in the & kde; mailinglists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options to enable or disable the compile time with the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the kdelibs package and no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a little guide how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD require that your window manager stops the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, but fluxbox will work for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, as these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the taglib developer under bugs.kde.org and also hang the broken file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and let the collection again be created.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time, this is because Taglib crashes with reading the meta information from this file. please report this error to the taglib developer under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Ensure that all libraries used by & Amarok are compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, or Amarok, compiled with GCC 3.4, taglib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing the meta-information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, then deactivate autom. turn off when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least use no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail will automatically open to a crash). if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-info, but these are not known as Unicode. the following perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl die "The file $ARGV [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib- &gt; new ($ARGV [0]\ "$mp3 &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok, only a blank playlist appears. how do music pieces come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitively, the start sub-window was converted to the statistics window. you will find it under Extras Statistics.</seg>

<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including the creation of a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a running text display, which shows the currently running piece or the current stream. directly below it is the area, the play time, bit rate and samplerate of the current play. a click on this section changes the display of the already expired play time for the remaining time of play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, also under the running text display. you can switch from the available analyzer by clicking the left mouse button on the pane.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Die & Amarok; -Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, enlarged window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Under the running text display, the knobs PL and EQ. the knob PL enables or deactivates the Playlist window while the EQ button is used to set Equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the slider to set the play position or volume. with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or last piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in Equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the box Equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia player. it has many features that do not exist in any other player, but don't let yourself be deterred by the abundance of functions, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left hand side is the navigation pane. in the navigation pane, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right hand side is the playlist itself. the playlist is easy to use, yet even for advanced users power strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context-browser displays various information regarding the each running piece. the context browser contains three sub-windows: music, text and interpreter. these three sub-windows will later appear in detail. they provide information about the current piece on each of the different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you might notice that the subwindow will drop off. the information presented there are now split into other parts of & Amarok. furthermore, the information can be viewed in the statistics window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow shows information about the currently running piece, as well as the interpreter and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this sub-window shows information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, interpreter and the album. below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to play the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You can find more information about the current play under the MusicBrainz symbol. you can see here how often and when the piece has been played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To view cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the images may have arbitrary names, but pictures with the word front in the name are treated preferentially. the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next area, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the pieces of Recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpreter. this section shows the five highest scores of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set what information to display in the music subwindow. right click anywhere in the sub-window and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last area, albums of the interpreter, lists all albums of the current interpreter, which you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be opened and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also click the right mouse button on it and then select one of the ways to add the piece or album to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the subwindow text, the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece. this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self-written scripts. once you click on the text underwindow, try & download the text for the piece from the Internet. if there is no text script running, you can choose which should be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then saved in & Amarok's collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The search button opens a search on Google.com after the lyrics for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping interpret - grouped only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping artist / album - first the pieces are arranged according to interpret and there will be another split after the respective album. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various Artists.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping artist / year - album - Sorted by interpret and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically by each other. the interpreter will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / interpret - your pieces are first sorted by genre, and among them by interpret.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping genre / interpret / album - this setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize the grouping at will and combine them.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically record your collection once you have something on the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, this could take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Right under the toolbar, there is a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. instructions for using this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Below the search filter is a selection field, with which help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can also select different time windows, from the last 24 hours to a year. you can also select your complete collection, which makes the filter practically switched off.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - Empty the current playlist and add the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to the playlist - Adds the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as Playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name to save the list.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Adds the pieces in the queue to transfer to the Media Player. see the Media Player Browser section for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn on CD - Through the selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as a data or as an audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) Move files to the dustbin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">As a compilation - select the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears among other interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">The album will then no longer be displayed among other performers but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browsers are easy to handle with many playlists. among other things, it also includes intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlists contains the smart playlists. these use & Amarok's built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that has never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click the Intelligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist. there you can enter all the required criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The sub-window media player is used to connect & Amarok with your portable media player (e.g. iPod). for example, to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; for example, it must be included in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod to interpret sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them to the list interpret. if you're done, click Apply. thus, the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod. if the transfer is completed, quit & Amarok; and release the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar you find a search area with which you can search for a file. search is particularly useful in folders with very many files, because all files are hidden in the file list that do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is a address bar where you can pick music from a given URL. for example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz input and press Enter key, you can access music from the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult due to simple case dropping. in that case the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically include dropped files at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired location. as soon as you enter letters, only the pieces containing the letters are displayed, which contain the letters. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter separate search terms by whitespace, search & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. if you enter, for example, one in two, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter between the search terms OR, search for entries which contain either one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries, contain the spaces, then enclose the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will be searched for entries, which include Mike Oldfield, but not for entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for larger or smaller. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a certain search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants at will. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this is looking for all pieces that contain either Mike Oldfield or have a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then click the right mouse button in the desired sequence on the entries. the entries then receive a marking with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left hand side you will find the button Add to add to the playlist. to the right you will find Playlist Save, Playlist Empty and Acceptible Mischen.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons follow undo and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar, there is a unique, magnifying analyzer. the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as the one you get in the player window via the right mouse button. over this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration setup.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more available buttons for toolbar, for example playback controls and volume control. you can set the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and set up toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it shows the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total game time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and playback is displayed. the status of random mode and playback can be easily changed by double clicking in the corresponding display area using the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar by deactivating the status bar in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking in the playlist on the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1404">One click on this entry opens the visualization plugin window. there you can select the visualisations of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry you will find a submenu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover administration is a useful tool to manage your cover images. you can start them by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser.</seg>

<seg id="1409">The queue administration received your big move in & Amarok; 1.3. with this feature you have even more control over the playlist. after you have set a piece into the queue, a number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will be played: 1 is played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">If you want to add a piece to the queue, select the item in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces using the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue administration.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are already preset (the details to set up these later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces while playing.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Adds pieces based on Last.fm's recommendations (formerly: Audioscrobbler). this mode requires that some pieces already are in your playlist. you don't need a Last.fm profile so that this dynamic playlist works.</seg>

<seg id="1462">When you visit this entry, you can select files to add to the project via the pop-up dialog. this has the same effect as if you are entering the files directly from the top view into the project view. if the current project is a data CD, the so added files will appear in the base folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Opens the dialog box for the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project. the only difference is the additional button Burn, the & k3b; to burning the medium. the burning dialog can only be opened when the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described via the What is this? help described (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it causes & k3b to import files from a previous session to the current project. this is useful if you are not using files for a multi-session CD. it is intended for you rather than help, so that you can see the files and folders already existing on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry only appears when an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this feature causes & k3b; to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project. this function removes no files from the medium, it only blinds the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Opens the CD Copy dialog. alternatively, you can create a CD's copy to another medium. alternatively, you can only create a copy of a CD that you can then burn later. furthermore, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of normal copying. you should also prefer clones if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Alternatively, you can also create a copy of a DVD that you can burn later later. alternatively, you can also create a copy of a DVD that you can then burn later. furthermore, the target medium must be large enough to record the entire (video) data of the source medium in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW. this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog for formatting a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R (W), making the content completely deleted. & k3b; lets you choose between the typo modes overwriting and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">The dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported yet, you need to use other tools such as Nog2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burn a previously created DVD image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously read DVD video can be converted. this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents, but can also be used alone. it contains information about the selected video, coding settings, and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black margins.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the inserted medium. this information is displayed in the table of contents and includes properties of the medium, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Displays a list of toolbars of & k3b;. if an entry is checked, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">When this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives. if the contents view is checked, their contents are displayed in the table of contents. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as Media Info, Lock and Unlocking the drive or ejection of the media.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The Table of Table refers to selecting and dragging files into the project view. the table of contents is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs, provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD has been selected in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow area, which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header bar has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box for changing the key assignments for & k3b;. after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the assignments for it further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; setup wizard. thus, the correct permissions can be set for burning CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so you must enter the password for the system administrator (root) when starting the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here, general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work on hieb. this dialog is intended for personalization and to fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical to the functionality, therefore more your taste and the type of your task is decisive, which of the two programs give you the default.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the dcop command line program. to be able to use the & DCOP functions, you need to make sure that & k3b; started. then give something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP functions, which have all the & kde; program common, supports & k3b; mainly two more parts that are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatDVD and other functions for generating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Void XPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCO</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPref (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above-listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void createFolder (QString name, QString flags) void addUrl (QString path) void renameItem (QString path) void renameItem (QString path, QString array) void setVolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">With this, it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts the files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; a reader for & kde;. with it you can easily read audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible depending on the encoder that is installed on the machine.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and from many encoders that encode these wav files (compressed). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (lossless compression) are supported by default (this encoder packages must be added from the Linux distribution). more encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read out and saved to WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per caption) are compressed to the MP3- or OGG format or even in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions, so it is probably not necessary to compile something yourself. however, only the encoder packages must be installed, which are needed. if, for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoder / file format is to be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, use & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device fails to cover the protection, it is not possible to use a protected audio CD; in any case & kaudiocreator; even do not avoid the mechanism of copy protection.</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup needs to be done only once (the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found), a daily approach to reading a & CD is explained. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface that you'll often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, where everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands of the main window. on the page step by step example you find more information on how to use this program as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB request of the CD-data according to the setup of Inquiry in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case must first be connected to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if a encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available encoders so that the selection with a different encoder can be read as the standard. it should be noted that previously the encoder in the encoding settings tab was configured in the Setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already read-out file is selected to code instead of a complete & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the Setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as logs, piepses) for program events (such as reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different card cards (like encoders, to set the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoder and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a lossless audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorts' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences are less important since both encoders generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame is still supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playsets is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB Stick, Memory card, HDD) or special auto-stereo systems. today - in the beginning of 2009, these devices mostly support only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting should usually offer for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset Extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset Extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate approx. 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and car radio systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane' = 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated to most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information retrieved manually or fetched by the program automatically from the freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. they can be passed / used with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; titles to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter by & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks like '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button designation in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs, which can download information instead of typing itself into the calculator instead. it is worth noting that here only text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, name of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (the author intended) am not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information that is publicly available on the & CD; no more or less valuable, so neither the artist nor the music company can be inflicted. all information can be obtained from a bumble through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used when retrieving data from the server (This may only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and compares the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which readout program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. please note that the cdparanoia package must be installed first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For storing the selected wav files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. the first opening contains predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed by the respective Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also necessary for the predefined encoder. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches using a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). you must replace 'lame' by the name of the installed encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the setup of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read just and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you are using other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time, setup everything and read our first & CD; we'll use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 search keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example using a search engine as it is considered not entirely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have read access (eg; by trying to copy something into it with the Konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiocreator;, something which is probably only once done and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to be used (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them with each reading of a & CD, once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the readout program to read the & CD; -Data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of device designations for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card tab General Settings. here there is not much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be as left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Just select Include incomplete information so that you will be informed when details of generating keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card label CD; settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop-down box is easier, a & CD; entry found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resultant directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory name and file name will be changed easily with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, please note: if you want to manually enter everything manually, please deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. however, this is about 620 MB large, consider this twice if this is worth it. to freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card tab.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data query, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the freedb section.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org page and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as far as the server is concerned, as many firewalls boot the protocol 8880 by default, maybe more luck with the protocol 80, because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to transfer data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the / tmp folder exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number simultaneously reading pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know it, so simply try himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; check out after reading the last piece: check this to the & CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must specify the path / folder in which the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files are created in the private folder. if you do not forget this folder, if you want to do something with the wav files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All the same as it is on the screenshot. the command is a little long, under certain circumstances something must be fed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme' defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, it is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' to restrict the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoding WAV files: with a dual-core or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine, you can attempt to encode more than one wav file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; finished. this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was described in the previous section and set up. first, a connection to the Internet is constructed, since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb will be set up. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from the data saved for a & CD; with success from freedb data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually insert instead of retrieving them from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example can be found. it's a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, then the & CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length in the window should be listed as shown in the screenshot. this only if the CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, then search for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section on the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully picked up by the freedb, all the titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; a window will pop up and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for automatic retrieval of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for Settings), you can also manually redeem it by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field 'current title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom commentary box can be used for individual comments inidividual per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor, so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words start with uppercase letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the commentary box. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the help to the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">For more information go to freedb.org website and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap can be found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor will appear again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you entered all title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Note: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or off. make sure that all pieces are selected, or click the All pieces selected at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking on the button selection read the read process, this window will appear to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what happens.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab job to turn on the order window. it is in the upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is currently read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left bottom of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message appears when you try to work with a encoder that you have not yet installed. pieces that were not successfully coded are marked with a red 'X' in the job list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we entered here in the example. did you check if you have typing access to the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The job 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus, read and code parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. in case of low-performance machines, the result is unclear. the computer used with an AMD64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and encoding (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is encoded and a third order is placed in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message will be displayed in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. bzw. 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at persons who compile from source files, and not for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help like the program can be customized to suit your needs, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs, has many variants of settings. best read the step by step for example to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshots of the various map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading it? even if only the help menu was clicked after the first-time start of the program, without any reference point as it should go on from this empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program boot), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it? who reads this, probably already started the program. it should look somehow like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately, no email. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator, may it do. at least only after the contact with the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and therefore agrees with this proposal.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaoke player from & kde; in addition to others, he has with real-time graphics and karaoke ring highlighting of texts also some features that others & UNIX; -MIDI players don't have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS - and & kde; support also work. & kmid; also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound projector required for GUS cards.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it's easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop so you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a & konqueror; window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files (songons or textual events). kmid will automatically retrieve the process used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. if you finish & kde; during playback of a song, kmid will start with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also create a file from a & konqueror; window in the & kmid; window will drop. this also works with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the button to play in the toolbar, select the play from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece starts automatically as soon as you draw it to the & kmid; window. (for several pieces they are added to a collection and then played successively.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows left and right of the tempo display and thus change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu item pause in the menu item, thus interrupts the playback. press the space key while no piece is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use texture, others use song events and others both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set what events are to be presented and even better: the event type will be automatically retrieved, which uses a song so you don't have to manually adjust the karaoke text. you still have the option to change it if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select from the Settings menu item settings or property events. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these are played after the series. in this section, you'll find how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, open the collection manager first. you will find it in the menu collection under the item Organizer. click on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired items in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection will not be saved. remember when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you have to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song using the button Add a song. this again appears the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece of opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop) is automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when a piece is opened. this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series after the sub-menu sequence of the menue collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song button, the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back to a song, select the previous piece button, the previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, since it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not general MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General MIDI events translate into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-Map that converts all the events of the Typs Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet type and therefore always sound a trumpet when a piano was originally supposed to play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need MIDI-Map because all sound cards are GM-compatible (including Awe and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI-Maps. so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all required implementations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different textid (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of keymap..." END Define keymap "One more keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is used to indicate that a section begins (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email, so that I can offer & kmid support in future versions; support can be for devices that are not general-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section you specify how the Patches of General MIDI can be mapped to your specific keyboard. general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeys To M is needed to put all the sounds that this instrument needs to note on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard for example does not support a gun shot (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a gun shot. to do this, you can use the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is the term 'Drum-patch' of the patch, in which every note represents another percussionist instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how sounds are shown on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to display sounds on the percussion channel. see for example the keymaps included.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, you can simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (general MIDI to channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel which is shown on the N channel. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will be used with the name Name for this channel. the corresponding keymap must, of course, be further defined in the file. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored that will try to change the patch on this channel.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussions-patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio specifies in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-bender event with the value n, this is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to be no decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM admits that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch-bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards will try to play two notes up to one octave. in order to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-Map, simply open the dialog for MIDI settings. you can find it in the menu under Settings, Point of MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboard you see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button illuminates no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (up to now) has two different views to display the played sounds. in the View menu, select View on the View Channel View: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc, so that the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support, you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Accept, support & kmid; drag and drop. just open the folder you want to add to & konqueror;, select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Previously, enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; working area a & konqueror; window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a karaoke file) or stapled (if I want to play a karaoke file) or I want to play a file only in the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file to the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection, turn off Automatic Adding to the collection, and the new file will add to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so set the setting of Automatic Adding to the Collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid, and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, I encourage me to continue to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga (Spain). at the moment I'm in the third year, so I don't have much spare time for my hobbies but I try to take a bit of time. as a hobby, I have programming, MIDI files collecting, making music and proving propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where they can download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid, or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: Larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arraket.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a big pleasure if you send me a postcard from your place or a MIDI- / Karaoke file from a local group. all that send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I'll be among friends of & kmid; but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me as I might have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; completely written in my spare time and won't get money from anybody for it. I would like to emphasize that I'm just getting more programmere because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - Behind the defect that the pitch of AWE cards was too high.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it's not the same if you use a FM radio or an AWE map.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you need to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can of course not hear any music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; -mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as DVD s, VCD, or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this machine.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; user Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andcurable windows. there is always the window with the central view. alternatively, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that will only appear when information is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to store the preferred links below the Bookmarks menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Sustainable Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy. if you balance an entry, his group and all subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the added entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' Current piece ', TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing the XML configuration files. of course you can only do that if & KMPlayer; not running through an editor, but also through the application itself. simply click on a name of a category to select from the menu view and next edit mode. by clicking a sub-group, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you need to select from the drop-down menu with a playlist and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer, some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation when starting and loading can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and change [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at the start doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be annoying at the end animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation may be ads of a favorite photos: & lt; smilgt; & lt; img dur = "ingement" src = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet" / s; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for the configuration of MPlayer in the Configuration dialog by & KMPlayer. here the path from the MPlayer and the clipboard size of the data stream can be set from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the tool bar of KMPlayer. here the output of mplayer is visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the Configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, just like setting the backend by mimetype. here is an example of how a "flash" is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'flash 'can be played within & KMPlayer; even the special field embed for YouTube can be inserted in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So that the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can be reproduced in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as a service provider for the Mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the Setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is to run in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library. if there is no error, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">In order to always use a preset backend for a certain mime type (of course only if this was also determined), this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play by TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the scanner can be used and the TV channels can be used. this can be used to edit the scanner from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring VDR (video data recorders) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the settings is under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR &gt; XVideo Port. there should be detected ports selected (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb contained in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of SMEs can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playback of Video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be functional. therefore, the following must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, KMPlayer is used for sources different names. at the time of creating this documentation, this is dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there references like I can make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom can be executed as user root after mounting the device. it is absolutely certain that / dev / cdrom is pointing to the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why does my CPU have to be tested for its performance every time?</seg>

<seg id="1741">QT;: & Qt; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is required for compiling & Kile;</seg>
<seg id="1742">Latex;: a professional font application. under Unix-like systems probably relies on the package & texlive; resp. & tetex; (for older systems).</seg>
<seg id="1743">Most of these components can be included in the used & Linux; distribution. for installation, the documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be used.</seg>
<seg id="1744">The & Kile; -Project includes some already compiled packages of & Kile; for various distributions. they allow easy installation without further compiling and are included in the Kile; website.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with & latex;, & kde;, & Kile; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users probably don't have to read this manual. however, all suggestions for documentation are taken into account. if the support for this project or its documentation is desired, the contact should be made via the Kile; website.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Questions about or when compiling & Kile; on or if expansions are required, this should be addressed on the Kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1748">& Kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for the & kde; work area. & Kile; offers the possibility to use all & latex; -functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple, immediate and tailor-made access to all & latex; programs. in addition, & Kile; the easy-to-use assistant, the & latex; reference and powerful project management.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about & function; and to experience its possibilities, the manual should be used to Kate. users of & Kile can start working directly with the reading of the chapter works with the editor.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the right outlet: lay-TECH. turning the original & tex; difficult to use can also use a laie (engl. lay) & latex; -Makros. a less demanding but realistic explanation is that it descends from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Here only a good overview of & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book to be able to rule, good books, e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999 dafÃ ¼ r.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Just as other markings include & latex; an introduction with which the general properties such as paper format, page numbering and text green can be specified as well as a body with the text. the introduction contains at least the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The quick-entry assistant of & Kile; is a useful function for quick creation of a document in & Kile; the selection of the wizard (menu) provides some possibilities for the creation of the document. you can also modify some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: article (article), book [book], cover [letter], article (DIN) [scrartcl], report (DIN) [scrreprt], book (DIN) [scrartcl], projector [beamer], slides [prosper] or user defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: the encoding of the system is set. modern systems increasingly use UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best UTF-8X should be used (for correct processing of & latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used additional packages for & latex; for inclusion, they only need to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), Report (DIN), Cover (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about it. it is just a short description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; it offers - just like other source text editors - the highlighting of the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). through & Kile; it is very likely that any mathematical environment is not closed.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The automatic digestion of the environment is generated by typing a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) by & Kile; automatically creates a blank line (for the input of the text) and the corresponding line to the queue (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set in the menu settings Kile; set up... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; allows the document subdivision into the following elements (part is the highest and subsection of the item):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective object.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful when creating your own & latex file. as soon as a DVI; file is created, navigates & Kile; by one click with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer to the corresponding row in the latex; source text.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as font and is besides PDF the commercial output of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the return search, the elements of the DVI; file are knocked with the editor and as soon as the element is clicked in the DVI; file, the code search is the exact opposite of it. as soon as a section in the latex; source text was clicked, the corresponding place in the DVI; viewer is pressed.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document working with other embedded .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set about project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick-build: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File Monitoring: in this mode the DVI; file to be increased nderungenâ ¬ tivâ ¼ berwachtâ ¢teau itself and there is no call from & eyepiece; after quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit toolbar, the three large selection boxes should be stripped. the selection boxes were designed for quick merge of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for quick breakdown of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The veritable & latex; -commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The choice field is available for items such as keywords, grounding notes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a name for a paragraph, an image or other element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a specified term (choice of a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list is displayed with literary merges. at & bibtex; this only works if the file becomes a project. for editing & bibtex; files are necessary editors. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; from hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection box named GrÃ ¶ Ã particulier e is used for the definition of the font size. it enables the font greases to be set for the main text, the joints, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile; two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and defining the settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ program class contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font size. if the font size is not set at the beginning, this can also happen later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code above has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the simplest way to do this is the use of the menu bauchery or the button fast construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; executes the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Suggest compiling of the document, should be sought in logging in accordance with the faults. when using quick-mounting, & eyepiece should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (engl. environment) is a text that is otherwise treated as the remaining document. for example, a report with the font greases are created 12 and only a few columns are supposed to have another font size. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ bra and\\ end {environment} is thus possible to change the font greens within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are supervised only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and usability of the document. for example, you can add certain fonts, grease pressure, cursive pressure, submissions etc. these commands end either using the\\ end command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {asch}: this command is for the italic pressure and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {contemplh} or any other environment. a single word in one sentence can be displayed italsively with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quota: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source text with the & latex; markup language, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile is now followed.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a little text was entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be done for the better readability of the document. for this, mind. a quote, a few places in bold and cursive pressure and a poem are to be applied to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document is viewed, the Editor-View or Ctrl E can be returned to the Editor (in the internal viewer). the window must be closed with an external viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file was created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. just try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format. these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - looking after clicking on DVI, then the document can be printed by file printing (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. as soon as the DVI; file was created from the latex; source text, the conversion can start into desired other formats using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a suitable setting for all & latex; -BinÃ ¤rfiles. just Modern under settings Kile must set up... Tools Bauen balanced.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to check the default search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source code and will be clicked asleep on default search. the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI; viewer takes place immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -Document of & Kile; open and jump to the corresponding line. to do this, & Kile; in & Okular; as text editor (setup eyepiece setup... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using the fast-fitting of the & DVI; viewer cannot open, an error can occur. if an error occurs, this is displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file explains the error source in the source text. in the editor you can then use the buttons Previous LaTeX error and NÃ ¤chster LaTeX error for jumps between errors. the log file always gives the line where the error appears. in order to view the incorrect line, the error in the log file must be clicked and & Kile; jumps to the defective line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">When clicking on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When choosing a blank document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document. further information is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Hands-on users of & latex; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or created a new file. & Kile; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings will be substituted by other data (e.g. name or string encoding). these variables can be set up in settings Kile... Settings can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by typing in a document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated input of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can be selected instead of the default ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files can be created. if a simple way to create a template, it should be searched for on the Internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & works; as an internal editor. & works; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (among them also & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings can be done directly from & Kile; can be made out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & operate; and to experience its possibilities, the manual should be used to Kate. users of & Kile can start working directly with the reading of the chapter works with the editor.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference which can be called for the Help LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands, which can be found in & latex; can be used as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that in this way clicking the\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with a left mouse button, the selected text will be copied to the clipboard automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with penetrated Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search the most different kinds of source code and highlight these. for example, the & latex; -commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many wizards can include additional jumps. this is a separate type of bookmarks inside the text. the menu entries, editing marks or the corresponding keyboard shortcuts the jump to the next or last jumps mark.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as & Kile;. although & works; already excellent possibilities offered, have been added in & Kile; key functions for writing a & latex; specifies always lots of environments and groups and therefore support & Kile; special commands for their selection. under Edit select the following commands for selecting a text:</seg>
<seg id="1817">WÃ ¤hlt generates a complete paragraph (group of lines containing a blank line on both sides). this extended meaning does not include a text with continuous lines (as in other text editors). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; -commands and all other lines of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="1818">WÃ ¤hlt the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, because this command also latex; -commands with a backpack (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To the end of a part of the document, of course it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key. & Kile; offers the key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; offers with own commands here for a quicker possibility. under Edit Remove are the following commands to delete the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is contained in the description to edit paragraph paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been illustrated that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore & Kile; for further commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or within the command\\ begin {environment}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested environment commands, the overview can be lost quickly. this command closes the last changed environment, so that the nested environment structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also provides special commands for & latex; groups that are determined by braces {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed right in front of the sharpened clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curled clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the braces of a & tex; group # it will jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many welded clusters, the overview can quickly be lost. this command closes the last group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be confused.</seg>

<seg id="1832">This automatic setup of the double quotes can be set up under settings Kile... LaTeX will be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">You can also use custom settings (e.g. nenglish or french) and therefore German or French suits. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift; input button for & Kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize) is, fÃ ¼ r & Kile; not just a line break, but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>

<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {Environment}, then & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {Environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input will be removed and, unfortunately, the list will be greased. on the other hand, the list may also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are removed by selecting a command. alternatively, jump stamps can be inserted, so that a simple jump to these positions is possible by editing branding marks and then the desired parameters can then be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; setup... tile; can be made to these lists. it can be used to list different types lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as options for general language-use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not used for the execution of environments. there must always be a few letters with\\ begin and the call for completion mode will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are so often used that & Kile; a special mode for completing the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">The command to open the environment is automatically instantaneously and it appears\\ begin {. after this, the command can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button.</seg>

<seg id="1854">To be able to examine the result of the work, the source code needs to be compiled. all the tools are grouped grouped into the menus creating compiling, creating converting and creating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewer like & eyepiece; or the other conversion can be used the keyboard Alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI; file can be converted to a file by means of Alt; 3, by means of Alt; 4 the DVI; file is converted to a PS file and by means of Alt; 5 the PS file can be viewed.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Quick-mounting command, a viewer is normally called upon after compiling. if no built-in viewer is used, a new window will be opened every time.</seg>

<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. in this way & quantaplus; the script is tried in the following locations: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables used in the command line: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replace the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be substituted with PID of the current & quantaplus; if by & quantaplus; only one instance is executed, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; it is used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods, a script can be input from & quantaplus; in the default input, you can specify what is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected range of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types issue: normal output, written to standard output; error messages, to the default output output. it can be specified what to be done with the text written to the default output by setting the output field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in the given case, there are not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the tag.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings to set actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all required fields and add the tag to the right tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the tag has attributes and you plan their use, enable dialog "Edit tag" when available so that an input is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let us replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol, that the action is better represented, we & kiconedit; use. select from the & KMenu;, Graphics Other Programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the start of the day, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually regarded as useless, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking this symbol is a & lt; startled; -Tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action. this happens via the menu with settings to set actions... (in & quantaplus;) and select the desired action. next to the text box there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so there are, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be divided to a better overview by some separator into several groups. open the toolbar to set dialog using Settings Toolbars. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator supports grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; -button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by sampling all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Backup in the correct folder. after new XML does not exist, it will be created in root folders, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust your descriptionrc, so that its toolbar (s) will be loaded (s) when a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user, it is possible to add documentation for the scripting language or formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might be able to check in & quantaplus; -Repository whether someone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; then you need to create the docrc file. then you need to leave the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = pfad, relative to this file, for example php42 / # Elements in the main index top element = your description for these documentation e.g. php42 / # Sec2.1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.3.html... [Context] ContextList = func1.html tag1 = func1.html tag2 = tag1.html tag3 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in the & PHP; documentation as something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2, PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Introduction,... Basic syntax = Basic syntax</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is sub-folder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents directory is referenced directly to a file (and more consequential at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder will be shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but watch & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The portion of the content is the domain of the docrc file which is used for the context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script to display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements that are to be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are certain that this is good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -Community. you will not be rich, but be proud to have been involved in the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the discerning resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or anything else. in various locations, you can send an Email, such as DTD DTD-Package (DTEP) with email, send tool bar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all others & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions are checked and made available only if our team uses them correctly and useful for the publication. to make an amendment, we recommend to sign the resources for which it takes a GPG / PGP key. thus, the source of resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When you are uploading, you are asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not stored), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the New resource dialog, the input fields must be filled (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded by the DTD DTD-Package (DTEP) menus, upload toolbars, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the template and script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examines & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signification. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; it can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in the tagXML format. there is the easiest way to convert DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converts a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which is to be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written by this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions line: the string that is in the! Doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and get full benefits from & quantaplus; this chapter tries to introduce these concepts to them, without understanding their understanding & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the workspace is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus; from toolbars to actions is all that is marked as global, in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus; it allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements are a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are custom patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns up to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project. simply put, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which enables the shared use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree view, the tabs with information and the toolbars. please refer to, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as close the current, other or all card imprints, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or run CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the editor area leads to another context menu with regard to the processed document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), editing the tags under the mouse pointer or opening the file when the string is called a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window, the toolbar consists of the editor. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional forms the standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus; the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, for example & lt; then click the icon that represents the tag, then you can enter the data for this just inserted tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (like anchor), you can fill in a dialog with different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction views (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open and strip them. in the presentation with tabs stand for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes, and documentation construction views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view displays all the files in the project and allows you to manage the files in the project using right mouse click. actions like adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage medium can be done with the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a complete website, etc; all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; workspace. global templates are always available, local templates only usable for the respective users and templates in projects are only usable in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking a element, a list of commands will open in relation to navigation and refreshment of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, manfast attributes and namespaces can be changed. the alignment system that is directed to the content allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development. it can be downloaded pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window, can be reached via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. thus, for example, the DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab displays all errors in the Markup of the current document. & quantaplus; -Scripts executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensively developed and easy to understand. show on a symbol and they display the appropriate command. the chocolates of the tool bar is the possibility of defining your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the tool bar as a compressed Tar archive via e-mail; if they receive a tool bar in an email, they can save and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of & quantaplus; for this autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of their bin folder. the same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid Web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a multitude of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a suggestive idea: what would be if & quantaplus; a standalone, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make him an absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML, then & quantaplus; it should be the appropriate & IDE;</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; development community is based. & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of Why develop what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; so to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted promotions, scripts and toolbars, automation is possible almost every task. through the program commanders, they can expand & quantaplus, without having to remember any scripting language syntax. (see more on it in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for fast web development and quickly developed to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way linked to commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More detailed documentation is with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and looked after by Eric Laffoon sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, where the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When inserting from the clipboard there will convert special characters to & HTML, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as a formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard into & URL; description, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily to insert & URL; s in the Anker tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to or from. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift; key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a line number. this is very helpful when your & PHP; script error messages exist!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of script functions and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Switching and switching the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as one switches to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu together with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from disk. & quantaplus; -Projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Search the project directory for new files that could be there. this enables you to copy video files to your project folder or subfolder, and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; from and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project is managed. in the chapter & quantaplus; -Projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in Project Dir / Toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of tool bar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be saved by setting actions. toolbars are saved by means of toolbars, or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar, you'll be asked if you want to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the tool bar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the loading of toolbars to the main server, where anyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; you or anyone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities are to be refreshed from the & DTEP; without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbar. if the standard (HTML,) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard in the Tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag setting dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or disables the intelligent paste of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; inserting by means of toolbars, if this day is contrary to the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plugins are listed under the above menu items. click on it. clicking on an activated plug-in is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the original version; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line-end identifier. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of the user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching times may need time or cause unnice graphics. recommended is the card game mode, which is also the default setting, or the sub-window mode, which corresponds to the display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open sub-window. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Displays the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog include any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Sets the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & nbsp; you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or which can be added and the sequences can change.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help in accordance with the mouse-cursor environment, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, for example after completing the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically. all of these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift; F7 project project features.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here is the server address of the machine you want to access, one, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.example) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol are used. depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a shared compilation of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a shared compilation of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. on server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Let you stop when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project. if a project is started from scratch, not hooks.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an accurate selection of good handpieces.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This displays a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or, by removing the tick, clips out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The latest screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the window frame or using the Shift key Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in detail. additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders are possible), which are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, also files listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows you to select the debugger. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set with the Options button. the debugging plugin is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the window profiles, high loading profiles (see in) can be set, as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile, placing your own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration, event actions can be switched on and add, modify or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs, such as saving a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was opened, cannot influence this behavior at present.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project open... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will be shown and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management view gives free access to the files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behaves as well, but the entries are missing and opening with... in the context menu callable with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removing the current profile. if there is only more a profile, the button will end to prevent removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in memory and forgotten with programing. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is needed and the rather uncertain password on the disk save option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high loading profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio Slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it after your discretion. the password is saved on the disk, so it can not be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simply docking the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened or deleted from the Menu Project or the project toolbar, which can be accessed, opened or deleted via Settings Toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to its own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars are in & quantaplus; it is best designed using the Toolbar menu. the addition of tool bar is treated at the bottom of the Add Toolbar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the icons on this can be set either using the context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which new action, a new toolbar can be created, allowing other actions such as toolbars, renaming toolbar, or toolbars, which can be specified in the dialog where you can specify which actions on this or other toolbar can be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, additional entries will be removed and action edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings Toolbars... and set Settings sets.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code-escalopes and files for linking. & quantaplus; uses templates as a common filesystem with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations you submit to the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; included templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions set at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that is not pure text. it can be any file except text, pictures, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually inserted in documents using shortcuts (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples are found in the template tree under global templates. more information on the template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually more specified documents are made in corresponding subfolders. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful if not a new document on a template, but the same text area should be inserted in the documents again and again. you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are to be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for entire websites. they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As template save as a local template...</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click Save As a template to save as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily dragged with drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used, such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder on the right and select Site template, enter a name for the template, and backup. by default, the project folder is backed up, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very target-oriented approach. you can design headers and footers or dynamically with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder, right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three types previously described; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded as soon as elternal attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits for everything except the regular folders in the template pane. if a root folder would be so set, it would disable templates in this path, unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">This could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying contents in a folder with special headers / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (pointing right mouse button) using a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one location to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & Source text editor available via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source code editor with the VPL; editor and the second, the editor window will divide into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and revert to the source code editor where the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor of a document containing & PHP; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit & PHP; it is still necessary to edit the source code editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that the changes in both the source-text editor and the VPL; editor are visible and the cursor in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor is already active. pressing F9 this mode is already active, the push button puts the active cursor from one window to another, maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization gap between the VPL; editor and the source code editor can be set up via Settings Quanta.... According to the choice of VPL, you can select between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation is: a small margin for fast machine and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">It is assumed that you want to change the title of the website so that tools document properties can be chosen. thus the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the VPL; editor is also called upon as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor is created. this can be changed:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list enables the change of the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to mount an external CSS style template by pressing the file opening button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is possible like in a word processor, because of moving with arrows. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves strange. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleting using the back button or remove button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way about the toolbars, as in the source text editor. it is important to note that the insertion of tags before already existing identical tags is not removed, e.g. if an anchor tag is inserted with text, any other converted anchor tag must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the tables wizard or the lists wizard are disabled. they will later work in the & VPL; work, in this release the tables or lists must be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for examining stylistic periods. in contrast to other programs for style sheets, the search for certain elements is possible and the performance of the style template can be pursued.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To be able to compile & xsldbg; besides & kde; still the libraries are libxslt, libexslt and libxml, which are already present in a typical installation of & kde; already available.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Stop in a template, at a place in a style or xml file loaded by xsldbg or on the current node. new in xsldbg 3.1.4: in gdb compatibility mode, versioned stops can be set in a specific file and line number and later enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Xsldbg determines the full path from a file name without path specification. file names in the same folder as the top loaded style template file name with relative path to the workingfolder with xsldbg Is, for example, a styleproposition file. / en / xsldoc.xsl, the following entry is possible:</seg>
<seg id="2231">In this command, a partial or entire agreement is checked with a notice called myQNAPcloud or a specified model name. & eg; template matches with any QNAP string containing the string template.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merging was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where maybe only the indentation had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned and kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently from each other at one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when assembling:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's colour monitors. if you have to frequently check code, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible. if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can look at a glance at the summary in the column on the left hand side. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, then you can ease the typing work by writing only the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Folder 2 Ordner2 kdiff3 Ordner2 -o Zielfolder kdiff3 Ordner2 Ordner3 kdiff3 Ordner3 kdiff3 Ordner2 Ordner3 -o Target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog enables manual typing of file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Using the button Folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparing or merge of folders will be introduced. if a file is selected for A, then use & kdiff3; then use the file name from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When collating is checked, the input field is active for the target and can be processed. however, it is not strictly necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparative window. the comparison starts immediately. in opening dialog you don't have to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is there? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you would need to create two appropriate files, load them in & kdiff3; load them and then compare it. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can extract anything from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparative window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret drag and drop text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each Info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while over the line. then a small auxiliary window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, you see the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color for this is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. this is in the next section (merge) good to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left next to the text is the summary column. when differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare cases relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line break is activated, the line is shown dotted lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the comparison windows) also has an info row with the inscription output:, the filename and [changes] when you have edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the knobs jump to next dissolved / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference must also be resolved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown. (this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for the current pane and on the left there appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes by automatic merging or by manual editing, no more line is left in the group; then in these lines of the text & lt; no row is displayed in the queue; this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marking that you may copy and insert somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; drag-to-drop; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy this text from the result window. carefully go with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources the options ignore or ignore ignoring C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the frame and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, down, side down, side, beginning, end, Ctrl-start and Strg end, Siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the augmentation window you can also use the other buttons for editing. using the paste button you can switch between insertion and overwrite mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as explained in the section merge and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Strg-picture upwards / Strg-picture downwards) or to the next / previous unsolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection to the clipboard, you need to copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl paste). it also prints the option selection automatically. if this is enabled, whatever you mark, automatically copied to the clipboard and manually copied the manual copying. be careful with this option, as you may accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line endings are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use Wagenbackward + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line files of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of most recently used files will be automatically saved during loading and restored at the next start. (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 setup...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you enable this option, differences are displayed in italic script. if the selected typeface does not support this display, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in its pure form, but would be rendered astert. on these systems the button presets automatically creates an unpaved color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press Enter or Return, the indentation of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection will automatically be copied to the clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard will then be copied.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer for saving. the default value is the generally accepted selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files & kdiff3; first, all completely identical lines can be found in the source files. only during this first step, white signs can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step, white signs will not be ignored. even when assembling white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a loader '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, while others store only a newline '\'. usually, batch reciration marks are made visible, but then they may be disabled with different sizes in the page-an-page comparison, but as a white sign. during merging, this option has to be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and corresponding characters ('0' -' 9 ','. ',' -') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is disabled in default. changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive after even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complex and large files, but slow in very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic re-jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unsolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically triggers all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if white characters in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time, then use better the features Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter for scanning of folders and performing a merge. look for details under documentation about the directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version of the suffix .orig. if already such a backup file with the suffix .orig exists, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapting this option does not affect the current running program. you need & kdiff3; quit and restart, so that the change will be active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because language is being set globally via the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the boxes for encoding appears a short notice what the local encoding is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding is individually adjustable for each file, even files can be compared and merged with different encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">When you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring numbers or ignoring ignoring C / C + + commentary.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color encoded overview column. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed next to the normal yet another second overview column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd rather want to use the space available on the screen for long lines. just stop the less important windows. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arranges the comparative windows side by side or overlap. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as preset names for the output file. (if this feature is used to restart the merge file, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor which corresponds exactly to your requirements. you can use this function for example to cut annoying parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to that external command (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command. the output of the command is only used in line comparison. you can write your own preprocessor which corresponds exactly to your requirements. each line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to allow users more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program it by themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for line comparison to convert the input into uppercase letters: sed's /\\ (. *\\)\\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is an exemplary expression of the text found in a line. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically generate created strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all will follow the same pattern $keywords. *\\ $/\\ $\\ 1\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of a further pre-processing command for newline-like sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several compositions at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' use 'to separate the compositions apart. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something different such as perl -p -e's / REGEXP / substitution / SCHALTER 'However, some details are different with perl. where sed\\ (and\\), perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor is retained for the ad and to merge. the other operations only change the data that the line comparison algorithm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers have to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can customize the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and shows the simulated changes without really carrying out it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and assembling individual files. you must specify only folders on the command line or in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder is specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not merge. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu item or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will receive a small message window on the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files that were previously compared will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, displays & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder that has been found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can fold up a folder by clicking on + / - or double-click on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right. the folder menu contains two functions All subdirectories and unfold all subdirectories with which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be automatically selected. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the above picture, in the columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow and black are used.</seg>
<seg id="2376">If identical entries the color is identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical. then also folders have the same color. in folders the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green, then yellow becomes yellow and later, when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): error: conflicting data types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): error: conflicting data types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to synchronize is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option folders are synchronized, then choose & kdiff3; then select the necessary action, so that afterwards both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B; directly after merging and kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the option to select a new file instead of merge (uncertain), then check & kdiff3; the date of the files and fails to copy the same date, then an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not eliminated, the merging of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging a file will be processed after the other. you status column shows skill if the merge was successful, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is okay everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis, KDiff3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unsolved, deleted, not white and white conflicts. (the column for solved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the just selected entry (file or folder), or all entries at once. if you have selected all merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specify a destination folder then in the three-folder merge mode C is used as target, when two-folder merge B is chosen as the target and when synchronizing A and / or B is used as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options that could be skipped in the folder structure. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries, select folder merge / continue in the menu menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut). to only merge the current entry, select the action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If there are still invalid merging actions by conflicting data types, a message appears that identifies the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box with the options will pop up, simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then perform certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge-window will open (see the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you're done with a file, select the folder merge to start / continue or press F7. if you haven't yet saved, a corresponding dialog will appear. then & kdiff3; its work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on an error occurs, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. if you continue the merge (F7 key), you have the option to try another action for the entry or to solve the problem in another way before proceeding with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were merged individually, notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not merge them during the later merge. even if the merge event was skipped or not saved, these entries will be treated as done. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (set menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called Directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. there can be multiple patterns entered. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folder must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as a delimiter. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig. * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as a delimiter. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig. * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autismatic files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder specific can be set with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hide attribute. in other filesystems a leading point has a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is turned off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is turned on, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively. (note that & kdiff3; not on possible recursions. a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to a loop loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the number of dissolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that contain no text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders through a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the date of change and file size. however, this speed unit costs you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is deprecated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The files are considered identical if they are equal to them. this can be useful for example, if the change date has been lost when copying. please use caution. this option is deprecated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Synchronize mode when compared to two folders and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging files are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical. also the results of merge files are saved in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead the merge of the newer file is proposed as action. (this is considered to be unsafe as it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too. you should check this in any case.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed and receives the extension .orig. If an old backup file exists with the .orig extension, it will also be deleted without further backup. this also applies to the normal merging of individual files, not just the merging of entire folders. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merge view remains visible to the merging of individual files; you can shift the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can turn the option directory & text window to switch the main window in the window menu and switch between directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. however, there is a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu. you can also use a single file directly, without first having to run the folder together. once you save the result, the status will be set to the controller and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder together.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you re-read the directory: directory menu: new read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things should you consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative. or contain.. This is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, Space &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link indicates a file or folder. then a file is always assumed as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, the permissions or the date of change differ from the original. (note the option of confidentiality of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently being as a difference viewer in ADBA. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In KDEVELOR from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & kdiff3; two full input files. if it is applied as a KPart, then & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then, & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the Context Menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small tool bar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it's compact) is already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I've been using GPL programs very long and learned a lot by listening to the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or going to go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably does not have the correct prefix to KDE. in default configure configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can not find resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are first treated as identical, but if only a non-white sign is different, the line will be treated as not identical. if similar lines appear next to each other, this nice coincidence but this one is often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this is necessary to simply resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit large amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src left; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already uses many colors to emphasize differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">See http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">Um & kdiff3; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should have no problems with compiling. if difficulties occur, please report on the & kde; -mailing lists of that.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift Delete) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. paste (Ctrl-V or Shift) inserts the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replaces the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and consequently not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you need to re-read the folder with the function update after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This will also cause identical files to merge into the target folder. if the destination folder doesn't already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably change in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source from A, B and C under the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be appended to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the rows are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default this option is disabled. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; displays a thumbnail of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the workspaces, change its size, end it or move it. this works both inside a desktop and at several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button window can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu has only the two entries to set up... and ending. if, however, click on an application inside & Kpager; you will also see the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries minimizing, maximizing, on desktop and ending. the commands cause the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other desktops.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, the name of virtual desktops is displayed in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is marked with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1st working area.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is ticked, the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is ticked, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise only empty spaces will appear to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon displays the window with its default symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; -main window can be determined: classical lets & Kpager; in a 2xn-Raster, as from Pager applications appear in some other window managers; horizontal displays all virtual desktops in a horizontal row, which is very good for representation sideways on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager MiniModule in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, view and move the windows as symbols or with its content. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right click inside & Kpager; and then set up selector switch... allow the dialog to pop up settings.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment, this can not be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor like e.g. & kedit; or vi. if you do not have any write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click, as soon as the mouse pointer persists at the same place. it is meant to help people suffer from the RSI syndrome (Repetitive-Strain-Injury syndrome) and which every mouse-click has pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click, as soon as the mouse pointer persists at the same place. it is meant to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which each mouse-press causes pain. furthermore, it can emulate dragging with the mouse. this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain created by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also be caused by the naked pains caused by the mouse. suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer, if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify it once again: even if & kmousetool; Pain helps prevent pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic tools: the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click as soon as you break the motion.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move activates, makes & kmousetool; a pause after it moves the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can execute the pulling with pressed mouse button. the intelligent moving requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This time of residence must be stored at the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouseclick carries out.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligentes move on, the turnfield is switched off (1 / 10 s). here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button, the mouse button will pause when there is no moving the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through mouse shift. if this feature is enabled, a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a break, a click with the right mouse button. a slow move to the left and back leads a double-click. these movements are saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, if & kmousetool; the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can do & kde; go to the & kcontrolcenter;, go to Sound & Multimedia, choose sound system and here the tab General. there is a slider bar sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this option is selected, & kmousetool; at every start of & kde; this function is currently only under & kde; please refer to the respective documentation for GNOME or other window environments to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you already pressed the user button, the settings will be reset to the user's last press.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The best way to use & kmousetool; first of all with the default settings. in particular, you should start off at first. if you are accustomed to automatic mouse click, you can later shift the intelligent move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should make aware of which places a mouse-click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral ingredients of windows or in places in the browser window that does not link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty easy. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you have to take the mouse ball out. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rollers. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and dirt can be scratched easily with a flat blade or fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you use the smart move in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation cannot stop by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute the mouse clicks and move the cursor to another location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to have it. but use mouse on a neutral area of desktop when you want to make a keyboard input. thus, a accidental protection of mouse & eg can cause unintentional reactions. safe zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart move, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is highly probable to copy text to copy it to the clipboard or to insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advice on this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using kmousetool; instead, select text instead: press a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will cause every time & kmousetool; the mouse button pressed a sound like a mouse click. later you can use the intelligent move without using the audible mouse click. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; the XTest extension need to be installed for & X Window; this should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are properly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer is shortened. this program was developed for people suffering from the RSI syndrome and those who are causing pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to allow a specified time to begin a pulling process before the mouse button is left off. in this way, dragging and dropping with the mouse can also be performed.</seg>

<seg id="2616">KNotify is the news system of & kde; it notifies you about the events you set out. you can read the text of this news as well.</seg>
<seg id="2617">In & Conversation;, the IRC program of & kde;, you can set up different types of messages. you can set up & Conversation; for example, set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an IRC channel, where your nickname comes. with & ts; you can then read the IRC message text.</seg>
<seg id="2618">Supports a & kde; -Program in KNotify, a menu item will appear in the Settings menu of this program. the settings for KNotify are different depending on the application.</seg>
<seg id="2619">The file kmail.xml, which is included in the delivery of & ktts; is a good example. it removes the tags br and b from the messages that send KMail, and also the printout / local / inbox because it can be assumed in most cases as provided.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced features of & ktts; for normal working with & ts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is processed before it is sent to the speech-dispenser program. they are useful for improving the pronunciation to replace false spoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker or to circumvent certain shortcomings of voice synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"" "to understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the program" "" "speech Dispatcher" "" "works with a text. & ktts; differentiates four types of texts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. if the output of Screen Reader is read, the ordered orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after the output of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you can read a long text on a web page, you can start with & kmouth; anyone who is entering the room is also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each job you encounter from the card tab is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are meant for the output of longer texts that do not have special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four commissions are processed in queues, except for the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a Screen Readers while & ktts; just one such preview, this issue will pause and terminate.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter the text and pass it to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there are still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String substitutes will replace parts of a text with other text. the pieces to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is supplied with predefined string substitutes, which enable the creation of chat messages such as: -) by text or for reformatting news from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; some XSLT files are included for translation & XHTML; included in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With interphone selection filters, you can send assignments depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have a female voice on the board map speaker, you can read text from KDE messages about it. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, depending on which it is applied for a speech output. if the filter stipulates that its rules are not applicable, it continues to pass the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that were set up on the page below. editing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the established normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to add a new filter. select the type of filter and the following setup dialogs are displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the creation of string substitution filters, you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be exchanged for the corresponding substitute text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it only needs to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries from the file are attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here. click on the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you click the & Ctrl key at the mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separated by comma. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs can be provided with the program qdbus;. the & DBus; -numbers you must omit. if for example & qdbus; the application id copy-3432 indicates, you may only enter copy.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replace filter is applied only to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Diesen Filter apply if matching. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">In comparison with words, the string replace filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. words must therefore be restricted by separator (space) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will not find instructions to write regular expressions. but if you have the & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it in the dialogs or Edit as help to conse these expressions. the & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; Expressions you will find in the package kdeutils.</seg>
<seg id="2649">& XML; converters translate & XML; using XSLT files from a format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such conversions. it can only be applied to well formed XML. the xsltproc utility must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the xsltproc program. if xsltproc is accessible via the PATH environment variable, xsltproc is also sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the speaker selection filter, you can send texts to a particular speaker set up on the Cartridge speaker or to a speaker with specific characteristics. for example, you can specify that texts by kmail should be read by a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before refusing a text to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected by the speaker properties, which sends the text to & ktts; sends, and the characteristics of the speaker set up on the Cartridge speaker. with the speaker selection filter, you can override the selected speaker.</seg>

<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the properties of the subscriber you want. if the text fulfills the filter conditions above, the speaker is selected, which matches the desired requirements. click on the button on the right to display the dialog box selection.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings.</seg>

<seg id="2676">The list of the above languages can be incomplete or obsolete. therefore, consult the description of the synthesizer to the supported languages. also, consult the website of ktts;, for information that is not yet included in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The program "speech Dispatcher" uses an adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand and extend for the use of any other synthesizer, please contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used to support SSML and for the & XML; it is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile and compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (Version 3.4 or later) including the packages kdelibs and the development files for the program "speech-dispenser."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts; from the source text archive for decode or download the currently created tarball, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use it, check first if speech-dispenser works properly with your voice synthesizer. to do this, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts;, which uses the program speech Dispatcher. the cttmsgr utility should be developed so that the setup of speech dispensers is possible and the script spd-conf is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is decomposed into single sets. the user can go back to sentence or satin, repeat the output or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If you give an application text to & ktts, you can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output, for example, if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is feminine, this will be used, otherwise it will automatically be the best fitting spokesperson. if you want to learn more about it, such as & ktts; see a speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click Add Activity on the card tab and then insert a speaker into the list or click Edit, the board map speaker set will appear. as an example, the setup of the module for festival Interactive will be shown below. details on the modules can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to festival is included in PATH, you will have to enter the festival only.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the string encoding for text that is passed to the festival. if voices are known, this setting will be set automatically. generally, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, eastern languages like Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders, you adjust the volume, voice and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some controller and display this gray, the voice you choose does not allow you to adjust these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded when starting KTTSD, so that (with larger memory consumption) the first set will be synthesized more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you do not have a speaker set up (or forgot to click Apply). see.</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window is displayed at the start of kttsmgr. otherwise, after the start, only the symbol kttsmgr appears in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is marked and ttsmgr does not yet expire, it will appear in the system area as soon as the KTTSD reads a text. thus you have the option to stop reading or otherwise control it.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here are all queues listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sets and the just edited sentence. the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column ID on the board card speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this row you can go to the order that is selected in the list below or go back. (but not every order consists of several sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With a click on the OK, all changes in the settings (also on the other card cards) will be copied to the icon in the system section. then click on this icon to display the program window.</seg>

<seg id="2703">This card tab allows you to set up special promotions, which will always be executed whenever the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority. & ktts; processed four types of voice orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. after the output of Screen Reader has been read, the orders received will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Messages have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks messages. if you have just read a long text on a web page, you can go to & kmouth; nevertheless welcome someone who is just entering the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text message is interrupted by a message, warning or output of a screen reader, adds & ktts; the audio output to the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text message is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory message are active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card tab apply only to normal text orders. for messages, warnings and the output of screen readers, there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To start reading KNotify messages, launch kttsmgr and click on notifications. the card card notifications will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Select this check box to switch to & kde. if this setting is not selected, the other settings are disabled and & tts; don't read notifications.</seg>
<seg id="2712">If this setting is selected, notifications, in which a sound is played, are not read.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to highlight text for voice output. this standard includes brands for controlling voice, speech, voice, voice and pitch. also brands for controlling the pronunciation of e.g. abbreviations. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the rab _ diphone voice (British), as this is the default voice, the festival is used in the output of SSML.</seg>

SBDs subdivide text into single phrases. thus, & ktts; faster with the preview, as only the first set may be synthesized or stopped or stopped, even if the voice synthesizer doesn't support it directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the punctuation filters. at the first start of & ktts, a set of positional filters is automatically set up. you can change its settings or add other punctuation filters, but beginners will get away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">On the easiest way, you will learn how to set up the selection selection by trying out. switch on the selection selection and select text to preview. switch on the selection selection again, change some features and check how the speaker's selection changes. of course, you have to have more than one speaker set up, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>

<seg id="2731">You can then pause or cancel text orders on the card tab, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set-level indicator filter is set automatically when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">The positional signs filter compare text with a regular expression for propositions and insert a tabulator sign (decimal code 8) at the set limits (tab characters are removed from the text before filing). note that the default set of positional signs retains the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of Screen Readers.</seg>

<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them feature a runtime dependency of non-free software. (non-free according to the guidelines of the Debian distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2765">As default is & ktts; in / opt / kde3 installed. if this folder is not specified in the environment variable $KDEDIRS, you must specify the --prefix = destination option. for example</seg>

<seg id="2767">CD no-apps make -f Makefile.cvs. / configure cd kttsd make su make install</seg>
<seg id="2768">Before you use it, check first if your voice synthesizer works properly. follow the instructions you have received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers, which is open source code. the quality of the voices is generally good, and several voices and languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You have to install at least one language. you will need help in the instructions provided with festival. if you want to read web pages, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The voice is still in an early stage of development. unpack the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you need to set the voice MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding like koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">The festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. so search festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option needs to be set to an 8-bit cynical like koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA; then festival takes over the lexical analysis and & MBROLA; it generates the audio output. the & MBROLA; -program and the & MBROLA; -voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA; no complete voice output system is. & MBROLA; generates language from diphon files. you need additional software to create this diphonic.</seg>
<seg id="2778">In this process additional wrapper code to festival is added to use & MBROLA; -Voices for voice synthesis. note that the & MBROLA; -voice files are not installed in the & MBROLA; folder, but in the folder festival / lib /. instructions can be found at</seg>

<seg id="2795">FreeTTS is a free, quelloffener language synthesizer, that is written in & Java; i.e. you have to install the & Java; Virtual Machine on your system. with & Java, you can set neither pitch, volume or speech rate.</seg>
<seg id="2796">The command module allows you to use & ktts; with any language synthesizer which can be controlled in a command line.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworks.conf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter, which enables the management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a set of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; create a simple interface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installing a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; displayed. the network settings module (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in the & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot be installed. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to enable & knetworkconf; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installing and set up. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the option of network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; index is selected. when starting module network settings, this system tries to automatically detect the system used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the choice is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to the distribution and release. by selecting the setting non-recurring, the definition can be made permanently. the next start of the network settings will automatically default this selection.</seg>
<seg id="2806">The change of network settings is only possible in the system administration mode. before, all options are displayed gray, which means, the settings can only be viewed, the change is not possible. in the system administration mode, you get to the right bottom of the module by clicking the button. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system administration mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the tab network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings dialog displays the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">In automatic mode the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out by a DHCP server or BOOTP server. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start, so no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP server can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The selection Manuell can be made without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration. in the input field IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network mask, the subnet mask must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device box.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the IP address, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched on as needed. switching a switched network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking interface.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched on as needed. disable an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the computer's IP address in the local subnet that transmits the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network where the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A host with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address. this is necessary because computers only use IP addresses. if the machine requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS resolves this name into an IP address, such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The BAE name resolution calculator allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. entries can be added, removed or altered by selecting an entry and descending or downgrading in the list with the buttons up or down in priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group calculator to the naming solution, a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to the naming solution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... The Edit dialog will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The name of the name known by name describes the hostname to IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used for booting if there are no DNS servers available. in small, closed networks it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list contains some known calculators some entries, which support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this is still to be replaced in the test version of IP in future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... The New Alias dialog will be added.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known calculator and click the Add button. if the known calculator has several alias names, press the button Add multiple times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit.... The dialog to edit your computer will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It may be one of the following tasks executed, then clicking on OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">Settings made in the network settings are not effective immediately in the system. to activate the changes must be set in a & Console; the following command is set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console; using rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively a tool can be used with graphical user interface like kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but in addition, the development packages with libraries and other things are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only by experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do so.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given about basic network technology, in the second section, all of & knetworks.conf; changed configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge on IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found any major distribution. IPv6 expects that it will prevail in the near future. therefore, this description is currently concentrating on the common IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, am & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the contact point, which is either a valid IP address or, if available, can be used DHCP. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks mostly addresses are used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = your own computer). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. usually, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetworks.conf; and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed dynamically, so that it will not be surprised if there is any other content to be found in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another level than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it provides the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first goal was to create a surface for tar which presented the ability of dds2tar to fast, selective excrement. the second goal was to answer a question my wife asked: how much longer does it take when you backup?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be done by & kdat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; howl the band back and read the prestressing information of the tape. recognize & kdat; don't know the prespann on the tape, you'll be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the pre-spann, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if this is not found, you will be asked if the index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes, in order to indicate that the tape was integrated. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the content of the tape can now be searched by opening the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration needs to be resolved first. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; there is a change of the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be discarded without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape of & kdat; can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A strip-type must be formatted before you can use to save data. this process does not correspond to the formatting at & kdat;. if your tape drive assumes that a tape can be formatted before use, this must happen before you can be formatted by the tape. floppy disk drives usually do not require formatting the tape, DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the bandname and the capacity goes & kdat; with the formatting of the tape. all data on the belt is lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you hit the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is saved.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a safety profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right click on the local file tree and select in the View menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup is started, the dialog opens for backup. in this dialog you can check again the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you have confirmed the settings dialog, the dialog appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the record for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right click on one of the archives and select the menu item...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the check procedure has been started, the dialog will appear for checking. in this dialog you can check your selection and change the workbench for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the check, the dialog appears to be checked. this dialog displays the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can redirect the recovery, the files that are to be recovered must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Edit menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog box will appear for recovery. in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the workbook for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the recovery settings, the dialog will be restored. this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to rebuild the tape file based on the belt content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can rebuild the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured automatically is updated automatically according to the selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, only the files contained in the same file system are stored on the same file system as the folder. folders that are located on other file systems can be included separately from the backup files. each entry is considered by tar independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only those files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; lt; lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up using the KDat menu item... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be done:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must point to the non-winding version of the belt device.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files. in addition, & ksystemLog; experienced users provide quick access for example on information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system lays down the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users give quick access for example on information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshots, & ksystemlog; functions available, with which help to filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will open. if this is not shown, and it will open instead of it a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not with system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log, for normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or according to entered strings. the list of the log lines is now automatically changed, so only the log lines will be displayed, so that only the log line displays the entry all. then a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns contains the string of the filter search term.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. for example, the string of the filter search concept will be offset only with the entries in the correspondingly selected column. for example, in the protocol file system protocol, select the name of a process, so you can see & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level error are displayed with a more conspicuous color as protocol lines of the level indicator. the colored display of protocol lines can be switched to setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain process (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can use the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can switch to new lines in the main window's context menu to display all new protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a sub-window, select a log in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own web page on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. there you will find more information about the source sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; in addition, you can find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; files</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named after) as & ksysv;. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init is quickly becoming a standard for controlling the program start-up system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not deal here further on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine on System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. therefore, you must ensure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service you want to boot when you run the system or switch to another Runlevel. system Services do not include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, on the other hand, do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls are according to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel tries in different places after the program init and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. in the beginning, you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have something to change, then you will repair it by restarting the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no correct files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written so that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when it includes a K, the script will be called stop with the argument. if it contains an S, the script will be invoked with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; have a server running level running only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user Runlevel, that & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of Available system services to one of the six levels to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or move the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. this only happens if you pull out an entry from the range of Available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be moved if you are dragging them into a new area. to only copy it to a new runlevel, you must explicitly choose Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste in the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is currently no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to enable the different working areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) and the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another runlevel, move it with cutting to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and paste it into the desired running level with paste (using Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry, press the Enter key to change the Properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, changes to the presets are saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard rune veling, and now the machine is constantly restarting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press Enter key to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; designed for running Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services in these distributions are started simplify the configuration for the proprietary setting programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan to extend the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all the configuration files are available (and whether they are located in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) are simply terminated without notice if their configuration files are not present or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even vary from version to version. if you are using any other distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save them. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the entry in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two flashcards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog for user / group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only when you activate space constraints (Quota) for users will create a card tab on which you can make individual settings. additional card cards appear if Shadow -Passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card card password administration appears, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This tab card only appears if for at least one built-in filesystem space limitation (quota) is activated and initialized (identifiable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, with the restrictions in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current file system is selected with the help of the file system with space limitation</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card group informs about the group affiliations of the selected user. the standard group, which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group. furthermore, the user can become a member of other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog properties tab contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or the selected group works analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO-BootManager to add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot the standard operating system, add the default operating system, remove, modify operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
