although I had visited the United States at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican L@@ etter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspir@@ acy of an oil mag@@ nat@@ es with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , who wanted to occupy the Supreme Court with judges who were inclined to his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free after Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the United States was only strengthened .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had a very much warmer love letter written about his great@@ ness .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me , as he walks with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stops behind the mountain , as one says so nicely .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declared his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ er and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him in mult@@ itudes .
the 13 million votes he won with the Republi@@ can pre @-@ election was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the Party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot@@ ous person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his vot@@ ers to the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ alism Programme , receives people from all over the world , a deep belie@@ ver with whom I was able to talk about Islam and its past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the present editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; also agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix Suns . &quot;
the g@@ umps int@@ oler@@ ance is also contr@@ asted with the gener@@ osity that I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who was fighting the environment for a long time , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she still adap@@ ts to Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es &apos;s commitment , which always helped me with lots of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice has helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump p@@ onder@@ ed his way to nom@@ ine@@ e presidential candidates , they offered me a hold and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white , presi@@ dency a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people .
the debate with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they shared either his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to design@@ ate the Tr@@ ump vot@@ ers as rac@@ ists .
arran@@ ging people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superf@@ icial and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act and think in another way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their congregations are not taken into account .
could it be that these vot@@ ers , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ?
maybe . maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cru@@ el decision to raise a man who looks at those who look different to him than he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; revol@@ t against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; wor@@ d@@ play of white in response to wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , what the great Van Jones called , has just killed what America did so magnificent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have , America is welcome everyone .
for this country chose as its President twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history he himself says nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to Hell with diversity , religious freedom and all the concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the helm , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r K@@ han , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. K@@ han had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Mr. K@@ han . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received an un@@ anim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. K@@ han finished with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is now &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ umps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and all the people who look like Mr. K@@ han could no longer find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from the mis@@ ery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC . &quot; &quot; &quot;

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
the music , which is played in both places , has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the outskirts of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds apart from the nearby pre@@ historic ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and an adult who has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students became a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mexico , is known for their drug abuse and the gangs of gangs .
but this changed after a casual encounter with a French pilot who launched a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope of hope .
the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the h@@ ust@@ le you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , fo@@ rest@@ le , ti@@ mp@@ ani , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga .
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically on the top of the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays &apos;s capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material :
music with restored instruments made of local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , saxoph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion all made out of rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music and music of the Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura commemor@@ ates the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in gar@@ bage . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin made out of waste .
today , there is a whole orchestra playing instruments of recycled material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentation called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world produces about one billion tons of waste each year .
those who live with him and of him are the p@@ oo@@ rest - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational play from rub@@ b@@ ish @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © FISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights illegal illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
re @-@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the shared use of content .
in West Africa , it was then known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the Iranian waters , before the other coast of Africa visited it .
the East African countries were thus up@@ set and little inclined to welcome a law criminal of this type at their co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ors , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed themselves against the ship . they refused to rep@@ el one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries , who simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior def@@ endant of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team who discovered and persec@@ uted the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pl@@ under@@ ing the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was FISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing stop ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries which had exp@@ elled the prime minister from their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like minded and work together . they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Trust &quot; En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing regions .
through the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were formerly ob@@ struc@@ ted by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les , and also through the sn@@ ail @-@ pace , with the information between individual countries , these actions happen in real time , with trac@@ eable to FISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange existing licenses , news on suspic@@ ious activities or details that one noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea through satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas , such as those who indicate that a ship sends its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were on the go and possibly if they have a criminal record .
countries which are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports . what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay for pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is financi@@ ally worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , managing director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consulting firm engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD of lost turnover , losing the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of illegal fishing , which penet@@ rate into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una f@@ ishers , which attracts the region commercial fishing from around the world . among these also illegal fishermen .
such practices include activities such as sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit license papers , specification of imagin@@ ative names , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they specifically use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a un@@ brid@@ led control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier a ship could fish illegal and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must not start my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and precisely this leg@@ ale lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close FISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now the closed front works .
since its in@@ ception , FISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspic@@ ious ships .
it has discovered criminal networks that had spread bog@@ us licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent ident@@ ities and it has persec@@ uted and found escap@@ ing ships .
because of its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crimes , FISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that serves FISH @-@ i to detect suspic@@ ious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evol@@ ving , also helps to detect the illegal ships who like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g Mat Tr@@ acking , a NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and provides technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , whereby they can no longer be used by satell@@ ites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects various information levels . it should help FISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ ally acting ships with greater precision .
a model program
but FISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Wis@@ dom has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana marine protection organization : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed anywhere in the world through which the position of each single trac@@ eable vessel can be displayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neigh@@ bors to get a better picture of who what where does - it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to investigate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project where a global system allows the pursu@@ it of ships .
there are indications that FISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only crimin@@ als , but also fri@@ gh@@ ten them .
ships that earlier have been f@@ ished without a license and had little to reck@@ on with consequences are now aware that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in FISH @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries set since fishing boats can buy more licenses ever since .
once FISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board hau@@ ling networks whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of FISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars annually disappear from illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there , six countries have joined forces in 2015 , so called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as FISH . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , FISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship running under false flag . and not only the ship was on the road without a license and were used to@@ wing nets , which are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was still penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for FISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time evidence that such a special , collaborative approach to protect the oceans is actually functioning throughout the world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is fre@@ el@@ ance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about the topic of environment , technology and nutrition .
their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and in the Guardian . location in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; rec@@ iting the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela appear to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are considered a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the dism@@ iss@@ al of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the government rejected Venezuela &apos;s motion for a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emp@@ t@@ iness by assemb@@ ling on the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the back order of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions of Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north of the federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is steadily deteri@@ or@@ ating , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the daily life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the administration of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the post@@ ure of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the government regulation in their latest article as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and ge@@ opolit@@ ics are among the highest in the whole world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new governance alliance .
the elec@@ toral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Unit ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , called on the proceedings against President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday national civil stri@@ ker and on the 3rd of November all come to Car@@ acas to the Mir@@ af@@ lo@@ res Palace .

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confront@@ ations with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ates of the government .
one of the most common pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the guards : &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , pictures accum@@ ulate , which tell of arguments , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
particularly large waves struck the news on police supp@@ ression in the centrally located city of Marac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement against the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear coats , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ ages don &apos;t have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic is already making the round , which forms the amount of supp@@ ression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had question@@ ed the validity of the demand for a term of office - this has now been proven in the eyes of many people by the presence of inn@@ um@@ erable people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signat@@ ures are counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ed .
here is your minist@@ erial vocation !
on the street !
others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has little undertaken against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and would rather be concerned with leaving critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing increasing in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry to take part in a strike , rather than to work or go shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to participate in the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of Córdoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said , as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Córdoba against his father .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , was investig@@ ating crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
beginning with the burden of wearing the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time , I believed that it was fine .
I felt like a secret .
as a child with 15 years old one does not realize that one is manip@@ ulated by his father .
at that time , I couldn &apos;t realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tort@@ urer and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ wicz . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father from 1976 to 1978 was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department of 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy , and who said before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows the great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of redemption .
from sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . I was standing there with a boy who made mar@@ tial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and ur@@ ged me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you are recru@@ ited with one of the ERP .
pass only that they will not escape one day and I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation of ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ cion@@ ario del Pueblo , - Revolution@@ ary army army - the military arm of the Argent@@ inian workers &quot; party .
so he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me that I would be a secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be fine .
on the military base , I had to anni@@ hil@@ ate papers that had heard the pris@@ oner .
these were all kinds of documents : University degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - simply everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little box wrapped in a blan@@ ket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were removed and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I jump@@ ed in and saw a couch where people were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a cot and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they fixed the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just been tied up there .
they rarely bo@@ arded a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured him with water and pursued a charge of 220 volts in the gen@@ itals .

the stri@@ pe there dr@@ in was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty win@@ ch .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that this is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that someone can do so much suffering to another ?
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were blin@@ d@@ folded .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian , who was also indi@@ cted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied to hands and feet .
close to the entrance , people stood still on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father re@@ marked that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What are you doing so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you get me from ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me about it .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero stroke there a man and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to data of survi@@ vor@@ s , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indi@@ cted in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial , was transferred to the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , the director of La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came here is also the way on which the kid@@ n@@ apped came here .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this route and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra till the arrangement from above came that they should be mis@@ placed .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; Kriegs@@ be@@ ute &apos; ( in german )
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
at that time in age I had no idea what the &quot; mar@@ tial &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war rep@@ ute are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military bad@@ ges that one takes away from an enemy that one has fought .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano with his son .
welcome to the archive
but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not a mar@@ tial , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is the@@ ft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I rep@@ lied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you , who l@@ acks cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded before anger , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , I will find you and kill yourself .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do this !
that was my father .
I have no good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I carried a jacket and a roll @-@ rag@@ ing pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a conspir@@ acy in this crime . I rep@@ lied , no problem , they can lay my burden on what they wanted .
I was there anyway to cancel .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now , where I &apos;m older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , one recogni@@ zes the value of a life .
one develops further and recogni@@ zes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have executed people during the dictatorship . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why kid@@ n@@ ap children ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
it would have been easy to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why their bodies disappear ?
did these people not even have families to whom they could hand over their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act which one can do to a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to remove the imm@@ ort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were grin@@ ded and nowhere dispos@@ ed - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something remains of course always .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I even stayed with the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the idea of displaying my father arose during a conversation when he stood under house arrest .
I made him repro@@ aches for all the atro@@ cities that I had to witness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt spiritu@@ ally dead and asked me why the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian sen@@ ti@@ ments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they allegedly def@@ ended were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried out :
how can you tell me what to say to me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to join them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only rep@@ lied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s what I did .
in 2010 I reim@@ bur@@ sed the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am prejudi@@ ced . I finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest standing still at the end of the trial .
he was charged with 416 crimes , including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly serious cases , torture followed by subsequent death in five cases and a case of kid@@ n@@ apping of less than 10 years of age .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the jud@@ gments in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ au@@ sa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ au@@ sa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magn@@ itude of the ruling in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 581 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial ended in August between March 1975 and December 1978 .
43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court rendered life imprisonment for life imprisonment and in nine cases imprisonment between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ al tests .
eleven of the 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdi@@ ct : murder , torture and rape by officers .
all def@@ endants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police members and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Monti was kid@@ n@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss @-@ speaking Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory conceived by in@@ human minds .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations , who have worked on justice for the victims for many years .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were mur@@ dered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial site could be built , which is now led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes elderly people in Ky@@ oto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the photo was distributed in the social media .

in the Japanese city Ky@@ oto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long his driving license , last month &apos;s witnesses of a particularly mis@@ erable translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign , the Japanese word played their own destiny ( co@@ el@@ y. sh@@ a ) , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older driver &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; fal@@ sely , but maybe also with bö@@ se@@ ous rear @-@ thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from the 1st to the 20th of September on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ oto . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the daily Ky@@ oto Shim@@ bu@@ n , which appears in Ky@@ oto :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Ky@@ oto just un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the incorrect English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; en@@ drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , although gram@@ m@@ atically not quite correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Ky@@ oto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for its correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported the following about the exc@@ use :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that elderly people felt ins@@ ul@@ ted by in@@ adequate correction ( translation ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News made a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; dre@@ ad@@ ful &quot; older motor@@ ists in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terri@@ bly &quot; was den@@ oun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older motor@@ ists . according to the police , the proportion of older motor@@ ists , who are involved nation@@ wide in accidents , are quite a cause for concern .
in the Ky@@ oto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a proportion of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior senior citizens 1,@@ 8@@ 03 of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
thus their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased in total , the proportion of inci@@ dents caused by sen@@ iors increased in the same period .
the name mentioned in particular did not bring any comments to the light published on Yahoo , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently would like against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo for translation errors has among other things received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So faul@@ ty is the translation really not , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizar@@ re mistakes in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
to over@@ ride , one needs two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to transmit it to the target language .
the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - should not be in the source language - native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate French into French - not from French to English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language , which could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees , nevertheless allow translations to be manufactured in @-@ house . then , the Japanese worker , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely distributed - often with funny results .
the confused and mysterious phrases that arise through machine translations are showing that this technique cannot replace human trans@@ lators for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the wei@@ rd English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious im@@ prints , which often decor@@ ate t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for sty@@ listic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may still be acceptable or at least harm@@ less as jewellery , but from big companies or government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the city Ky@@ oto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : taking protests and ens@@ lav@@ ement measures on the internet and television
home page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pren@@ sa y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Viv@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet presentations of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV are no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ c@@ aster took photographs of the protests in Car@@ acas , which were organized by op@@ positi@@ onal groups who oppos@@ e the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and had deleg@@ ated the tasks of parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er out@@ . he pointed out that the connection was c@@ apped and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# c@@ ens@@ or@@ r : enables your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again blocked .
this is from the side of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting about protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and closures when they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that it is still cheaper than two liters of le@@ mon@@ ade to buy .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed later that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more online transm@@ it@@ ters . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly carries out its sessions .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to certain domains error @-@ free .
when a website is blocked by the DNS , the server replies faul@@ ty or ref@@ uses the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS se@@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flores , who carried the protests live in Car@@ acas , was det@@ ained .
Flores was beaten while he was in cust@@ ody .
he was released eight hours later , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making the Venezu@@ el@@ an access to multimedia reports on the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ mp as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina fights for the rights of children and colle@@ cts testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who have been victims of abuse and discrimination .
photo by Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . use courtesy of a sculp@@ tural .
the following article is the short@@ ened version of a report by global Vo@@ ices published by the authors of Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que ca@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there .
shortly before she graduated from the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house spoke of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one that has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , in Paraguay the more than 46,@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money passes her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange the child receives food , training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned here is that the children do not have to afford inn@@ um@@ erable days of house@@ work , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of an agreement that cannot be lifted .
this practice , referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance through large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she talked to Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and pran@@ ced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vac@@ cin@@ ated to the cri@@ cket guarantees in general still silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double de@@ ception , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is , on the one hand , the family who loses her daughter in the belief that she will lose her education , improve her position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make something out of herself &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family who takes the girl with her and just@@ i@@ fies his exploitation with faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and might even be star@@ ved .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mal@@ treated , his family will learn about it only many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the previously relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the bor@@ ro@@ wed in Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , has a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent hits . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military personnel Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an officer at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with just 3.000 inhabitants , 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira hit Mar@@ ín as long as they suffered from dead@@ ly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the mur@@ dered child was a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela bl@@ amed the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they designated the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and called for &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neigh@@ bors of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who had their cri@@ ad@@ ita .
when the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a cri@@ mp
Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , in which her father worked , had to register bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to go all work and started selling cand@@ y on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked in the house of their employers between four and six hours every day .
she had to share the time so that she was still learning to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employers .
for instance , it cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school ended , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to hunger , but she didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the house &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at some evenings the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read Editorial from opposition parties such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sender@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Pueblo &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he considered them intelligent , but did not enter@@ tain with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened to talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would learn &quot; bad habits &quot; there again . &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who is part of the Guaran@@ í indigenous group , would be able to speak their mother@@ language Guaran@@ í back home .
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had given to her , she explains .
but you were fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them , with her hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a thing about which is almost never talked about are mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to Cri@@ ad@@ itas when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to go home . I had no friends of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I particularly felt that I was not a group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad sco@@ red five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; likes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village of Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ event@@ ful girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old nie@@ ce . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the authors switched to the display once more :

the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power is the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill of legislation dict@@ ates Egyptian users social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; six@@ ty Egyptian parliament@@ arians recently agreed to draft law on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regul@@ ating the use and utility of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if adopted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up , which is entrusted to allow citizens with permission to share social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the website of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could result in a sentence of up to six months in j@@ ail or a fin@@ es .
the bill , consisting of six par@@ ag@@ rams and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs and used across the Internet to communicate with others through voice , video news and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced when it is assumed , since the draft is no indication of how the Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose registration . un@@ clear is how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , MP of Parliament and promot@@ er of the legislation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password from the telecommunications department to get through the fire@@ wall to block Facebook . &quot;
this could mean Egypt plans to er@@ ect a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be required for Egyptians to submit information about their identity in order to access the network .
but so far it is not known that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are sk@@ ep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conducting research techn@@ ologist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( EI@@ PR , in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
I strongly believe in technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as it could be done by violent physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who seek approval or not . and this means a mad system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to supply them to a trial .
this is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt all is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the legislative election and the constitutional committees before it goes to the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its adoption and enforcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ant nar@@ ration is present on the image area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the MP , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y , proposed a law pro@@ position against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life @-@ long sentence for those intended to be found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

why is this certain kind of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persi@@ an Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the intest@@ ines of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on a big pre@@ dat@@ or .
the chance to see a Persi@@ an Leopard actually in the wild bo@@ g is low and goes against zero . when the team finds out in the video that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily newspaper Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , which was responsible for North East Japan , documented the progress made in the last six years to re@@ build the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple cat@@ astrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an A@@ tom disaster in Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima triggered the disaster .
the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its seat in S@@ end@@ ai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a beautiful pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring Pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to disappear , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had left whole coastal towns away from the map .
in addition , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima experienced a nuclear accident , already for this reason 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows , from a local point of view , which advances have been achieved six years later in order to re@@ build the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the paper contains statistics from the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves .
the housing estate in Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reported that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed in the Pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
the greatest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures was Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , where 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were finished .
I@@ w@@ ate completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima provides the final light with 70 percent .
nevertheless , even six years after the cat@@ astrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated of temporary shel@@ ters ( obvious pat@@ rons will be transformed , cas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) into final substitute houses .
after the triple cat@@ astrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in temporary shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima and I@@ w@@ ate in such homes .
almost 40 percent of Ev@@ acu@@ ated K@@ ush@@ ima Ev@@ acu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful on this occasion . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated ev@@ acu@@ ated after the disaster were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures concerned
like the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by mis@@ fortune , re@@ opened their doors by December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have raised in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land in a large area .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed farm@@ land can be used again in Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 690 hectares of 5,@@ 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima are located in the &quot; nuclear lock zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima remains un@@ defeated .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , on the other hand , can show only 75 percent .
however , the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also reports that since the cat@@ astrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next great earthquake ?
in order to obtain an overall picture , the newspaper led numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ated people . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and how her sensation has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , took measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , 55.@@ 9 percent of those surv@@ ey@@ ed that still hasn &apos;t been done enough in terms of cat@@ astroph@@ es prevention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as it is about those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has increasingly focuss@@ ed on the situation of the Ev@@ acu@@ ated People of Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima .
Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , disaster @-@ causing nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
nearly 63 000 people in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture have been displ@@ aced from 160 000 people from Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima .
at the beginning of 2016 there were a little more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , converted into permanent replacement houses .
according to the 2017 stand still 4@@ 0,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the Kat@@ ast@@ ro@@ phen@@ ols most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated villages are still in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ Housing hausen , older than 50 years old . they fail to get back in proper homes because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima will have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects which are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries speaking a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often sees that one more links than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt strongly connected to someone about language and country borders .
Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how a migration has led her aff@@ ection to Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa speaks about the time she worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after he was put together by the police at nation@@ wide demonstrations

right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week . last Friday , a police officer had hit him in a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . nation@@ wide millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against Spar@@ es .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Univers@@ ities of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him on this Saturday and now took him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures there is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a key . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás inform@@ s that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident by the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officer how he strikes at Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his bat@@ on on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive ward , his face would be seen on television for six months and the entire oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Luz , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs shortly afterwards rush to him .
another video with the same scenes , but fil@@ med from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family , who lives in another federal state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in hospital .
&quot; be bra@@ ve , Mat@@ eus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; against police violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Facebook Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here the milit@@ ant Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ in@@ ated by his father because he had sab@@ ot@@ aged the Oc@@ cup@@ y movement in secondary schools .
police Attack Hand@@ les
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
polic@@ emen were sitting in protests in the centre of Rio de Jan@@ eiro , where prot@@ esters had built a stage for speakers , Gum@@ mist@@ ie@@ chen and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SOL ) asked the police to reno@@ un@@ ce violence against demonstr@@ ators via speakers .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media drag@@ ged street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window washer .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were targeted by a broken glass window in order to illustrate their title pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set in fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window disc than about the protests of thousands of people who serve to defend a particular cause .
this must also be recognized when one stri@@ ves against any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also here the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ob@@ tains a absurd , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence in the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confront@@ ation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the For@@ gotten villages of Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba joined the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as El Central - on Spanish sugar mill - not@@ with@@ standing that there are no appreci@@ able sugar@@ s on site .
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories have been paraly@@ zed .
after harvest@@ ing , the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
around 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the job .
others re@@ signed and com@@ mut@@ ed daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob@@ bed his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active period because they were received .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene rec@@ alls precisely to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already with@@ stood the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a motiv@@ ating motive for the country some decades ago , but the bad har@@ v@@ ests are not new .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry shut off ?
the old railway stei@@ g of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : 155 sugar cane factories were technically dep@@ rec@@ ated , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories , which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 Report &quot; Agri@@ cultural perspectives &quot; issued by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agri@@ cultural and Food Organization .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will come into history with certainty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cub@@ an President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar@@ cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , is the word he repeated the most , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first closing year , the first letters began to come .
the documents were officially distributed , which differ@@ ed only on the parts that would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister was able to appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was handed over and the letters were getting more and more frequent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he assu@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , wa@@ its for retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the de@@ commissioning of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial zone of Cuba and the most important work producer has been ext@@ ingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services generated in the communities in which they found themselves .
we will never know if during the M@@ amm@@ ut speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president saw in the eyes of the people present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding .

after two years the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said when they began to dis@@ man@@ tle them , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ting the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms .
without work in the region , and with early age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to pick up other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a promising perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , the production of which does not even serve for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine crops bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a nach@@ tive person , yet he for@@ gives the lies you told him not .
they tor@@ ment him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes to pension with 65 years old , not because it is lacking in strength , but because he is bitter .

first Nations yo@@ ung@@ sters use hip hop to express themselves and get their own culture
&quot; &quot; &quot; recording of a song of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Home to Me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do it through hip hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ Stars .
the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants discussed topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , confront@@ ation , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the field of the headquarters of the Kit@@ es@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a street in West Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or mur@@ dered .
the cases were mostly not elu@@ ci@@ dated .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is despite the influences of glob@@ alisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the yo@@ ung@@ sters are not always familiar with the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation added , the chor@@ us will be sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved received a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ Star hip hop group , who gave them a drop in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Facebook page of N &apos; we Jin@@ an the stop@@ he is available in circulation , as well a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on earth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the day when you will take our cry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that one day we will rise up
I don &apos;t want to see how to live a bad life
so they can grow and continue our youth as well
thus they can do what they have determined by the Creator
in the commentary section , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also make a contribution and add the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ables ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic tri@@ bun@@ als ( rated current ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost any restaurant .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are located near the entrance to the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ it@@ u ( see the sculp@@ tural models of the dishes ) from each dish that is served in this restaurant .
the customers see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to making these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ ki@@ est part of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes , which the German filmm@@ aker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most of the Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend can now be turned into show@@ y mobile phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the Blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ it@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic tri@@ bun@@ als decorated cell tapes , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
many of these artificial food items were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collec@@ ti@@ bles , as in this case , refrigerator magn@@ ets :
here are some Sho@@ gun Cab@@ inet magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new boom in the ess@@ ences is becoming increasingly elaborate .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the station Tokyo .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the coming .
some mobile phones and mobile @-@ designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case ik@@ ura or sal@@ mon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping which is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; w@@ ow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile with sal@@ mon roe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes may also take a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of mel@@ ting ice .
in addition , there are also travel balls ( On@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands made of dried sal@@ mon .
additional sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # her@@ eto@@ fore match .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ it@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic tri@@ bun@@ als are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; struggle against drug traff@@ icking &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ chie@@ fs and trad@@ es regularly appear only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human trag@@ edy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the bere@@ aved or the churches that have learned to live with pain .
behind each cor@@ p@@ se , behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to live with drug traff@@ icking ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people involved in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organized crime can not only be feared by our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , when businesses close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and so many municipalities have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian por el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells you exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who cho@@ oses secret tom@@ bs after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father only one day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task that we have set for , go away and search for gra@@ ves , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the assurance of my father , but she does not pay them out , because they require a mort@@ ise certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editors of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ render a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explain why the project is so important : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who fear the fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered as normal , no matter in which form it occurs :
I have been familiar with illness and sen@@ sing journ@@ alism for several years now .
I pass on to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the cover pages with images , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who resi@@ sts or is sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be indiffer@@ ent to it or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it is not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people listen to songs on the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the crimin@@ als when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ tim@@ el@@ ess@@ ness of the people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring town can be justified that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ce@@ asing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to persu@@ ade that they remain spar@@ ed by such trag@@ e@@ dies when they are not stir@@ red and quiet .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; it describes how armed crimin@@ als pressed money from their business for month , until they had not only destroyed the business , but also torn their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your life in just a few days .
the pain about it never fails , the trau@@ ma will remain , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kill you or kill you .
in these terrible days I asked myself whether we@@ eping would dis@@ solve my deep@@ ened feelings , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who car@@ es about the child of a missing woman and a man who was killed by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , potatoes br@@ oth , tor@@ ti@@ llas , and &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the vial with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood had been past two years earlier than just a few blocks from his home , seeing the bloody cor@@ p@@ se of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Government Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was counted 3@@ 103 k@@ ill@@ ings . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Mor@@ des per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter the country &apos;s soul .
only a few stories continue to live in view of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to por@@ tray the complex information behind the failed battle against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which it links , include images on which violence is represented .
the Fak@@ ten@@ check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something appeared for the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to capture trag@@ e@@ dies that actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false p@@ airing of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in termin@@ ology by Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions to our desire for pictures on news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tank truck crossed the place S@@ ange in the East of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died in the process .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country was negle@@ cted for many years and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths full of stro@@ kes that were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the tank truck came to the victim .
officials described a fire@@ ball , the do@@ zens of houses covered , including a movie the@@ aters nearby , full of people who watched the football world championship .
houses burnt and char@@ med cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the inno@@ c@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user Myst@@ ical Mon@@ key , 12 January 20@@ 15.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident train the horri@@ ble scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of knot@@ ted bodies , which are lined up on the ground while people watch it .
but here the story does not find its end .
over the years , the same photograph was recorded several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and mistakenly used real but not related trag@@ e@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what and what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dra@@ st@@ ically of atro@@ cities before which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ p@@ se lay in streets and b@@ ushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a people to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many have been dism@@ is@@ sed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be depicted figur@@ atively .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army point in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ an and the attempt of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo , when it was mistakenly presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massac@@ re of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ erable usage of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assign@@ ments for Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a test@@ ament to mass k@@ ill@@ ings .
even one step further brings personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in conjunction with the dead@@ ly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a bl@@ itz message , published by the United Nations described those who could flee to blo@@ ws , rape and several dead , some through burning .
while others reported on the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this image origin@@ ates from an Saudi @-@ Arab news page , which was mistaken in 2012 , the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein Sein have said , monks and politicians would have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to photograph this information .
the original article , which was finally accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news agencies , named AF@@ P as their source , had also attributed Th@@ ein Sein this statement , but had not related the image from the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false cou@@ plings reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information borders can be crossed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an in@@ verse picture search with the search engine ink has found under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 344 images found , which are very similar to the said image from DR Congo .
they come from a m@@ ash of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have forwar@@ ded false reports , some have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have bor@@ ro@@ wed examples of mis@@ use and associated with the respective countries , based on what page they were published . by doing so , we want to show the coverage more clearly than by the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which were also linked to each other in some cases ) , several instances of mis@@ use may origin@@ ate .
here are some cases that can now be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .

this article from 2014 about Stu@@ dents that had been killed by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the recently deleted , the Catholic Integr@@ ated News Page An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the picture does not origin@@ ate from the k@@ ill@@ ings , but it claims it is a &quot; similar d@@ us@@ ha@@ dist@@ ic attack . &quot;
when the picture was later in connection with the Mass@@ ac@@ re of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ uy &quot; ( Nigeria bur@@ ns , the world sleeps ) .
the image of the DR Congo came up with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massac@@ re of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to their communities , which took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as evidence of the Mass@@ ac@@ re of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) . but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Indonesian ) , 2014 .
after a message that had allegedly been written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massac@@ re , there were discussion forums such as this here in Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to the dis@@ appointment .
from the emb@@ assy in which the image was taken from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ines mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves .
there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
inks , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) also points inks , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the cra@@ w@@ ler and occasionally they have picture names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only significantly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Christians through Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the murder of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ estimated compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investig@@ ating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images .
with social media there are tens of people who un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water around a trag@@ edy .
suggest this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and sm@@ ells it the real hor@@ ror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated extensively ( for example ) .
one argument is that the with@@ holding of images of a ref@@ usal is equal to recognise the trag@@ edy . sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images des@@ ens@@ iti@@ ze readers and viewers and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which examined how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is some discussion about violent represent@@ ations in the news media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists are experiment@@ ing with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually also be used detached from the context or in a completely mis@@ used way .
however , each examination of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons used in accordance with CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these conf@@ lic@@ able words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ lic@@ esa ) .
but all resist every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ sla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - strive for your parents in recognition of how to deal with you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ ym language spoken in parts of Brazil such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ zin@@ ess you feel after having been war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Birds own words from his blog about :
they der@@ ive other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to publish more of these &quot; insur@@ moun@@ table &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; highly valued by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite albums here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ds of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently the worst floo@@ ding flood disaster in this decade .
triggered by mon@@ soon , which normally places end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya have come over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic center of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud @-@ alan@@ ches .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe dwell@@ ings .
the ra@@ ins left on Saturday ( 27th May ) , and the water states in some areas slowly declined .
health and hygiene conditions of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water distances of up to 7.5 meters . twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et provide regular updates for the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of cat@@ astrophe .
Sri Lanka dead@@ ly floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , war@@ ns Save the Children after further ra@@ inf@@ alls are already on their way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the floo@@ d@@ water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the water peg@@ s of the Mor@@ og@@ oda El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and five other five are ready for the transport of emergency supplies for the inhabitants of their floo@@ ded villages .
also various organizations and start @-@ ups have agreed to help .
Facebook sites such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today number 0@@ 77@@ 74@@ 49@@ 729 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the cab@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the disaster centre is informed .
last year following the cat@@ astrophe of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; Hoch@@ wasser@@ hilfe &quot; button that allowed users to call on a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then forwar@@ ded free to the Sri Lan@@ kan Red Cross .
they also introduced an &quot; SOS &quot; button that resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ding water and water slide .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need in security and contribute to assi@@ mil@@ ation .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , with Sri Lanka &apos;s population now the long way to the restoration of norm@@ ality .
the Muslims that cannot be seen
the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
usage approved . in January I participated in Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and dear friend .
I entr@@ ust her my four years old daughter ; she trust@@ s me with her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we call still slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next we will make rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some keep the icon@@ ic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf , tied from an American flag , other cann@@ ed slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girl@@ friend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things don &apos;t concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar who know it - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they have ab@@ used me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims do not fit , they are ab@@ used .
to be ab@@ used
I am not alone .
this has even happened to the poet whose poetry is mostly sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come to mind when you think of him ?
love ? love ?
to be at home ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the Western idea , the religion of Rum@@ i was deleted as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting constitutes a major part of the history of the 1,7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have already colon@@ ized Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting visual language is determined by the dark man you should be afraid and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid cr@@ ushed the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures also prot@@ ru@@ de today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ er them .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , faul@@ ty nar@@ r@@ atives domin@@ ate our news@@ feeds .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that has led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative will fail to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings , and that Saudi Arabian , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exer@@ ts its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who make movements for change .
it also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and f@@ law@@ fully that Sik@@ h @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the Nar@@ r@@ ative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here where seven million Muslims constitute the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the total Muslim population are African @-@ sto@@ cked Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation from 77 countries .
the author &apos;s parents in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother placed her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrap@@ ers of New York ; Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ rat@@ zer were made possible by the Muslim , American statistics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man K@@ han .
back then , when K@@ han re@@ signed the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were non@@ violent Muslims and Americans .
but am I now inde@@ b@@ ted Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork meat , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes or my handy pick@@ pocket that all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pe@@ pp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I scher@@ ze , we do not carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also have no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who endeav@@ our to fight widespread lies on Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with fin@@ ders , think tanks and experts for fal@@ sch@@ information , which is already a faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is , have been manip@@ ulated .
because of the stories that we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger who r@@ ushes a woman to the head@@ sc@@ arf .
or as the fri@@ ghtening map of attacks on mos@@ ques across the USA , see below .

use approved .
I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born only then into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a pro@@ visional mos@@ que in the basement of an pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious lives , they refer to the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be seen , but they are there .
perhaps my girl@@ friend , my neigh@@ bor , my rock in the br@@ anding saw that I am Muslim , if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ritual with my daughter when I saw her in my arms and whis@@ pers the Arabic verses for the protection of the Kor@@ an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is still part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , poses with her sisters at some point in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging to my grand@@ mother , belonging to her sisters , the image of my grand@@ mother is her sisters ; as they gain a competition in the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi several decades ago .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi S@@ aints ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters that can be almost memor@@ ized .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers that she said to me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who has been colon@@ ised over the centuries - through a &quot; Empire , &quot; which has founded a company called Hon@@ or@@ able British East@@ er@@ di@@ en Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a profound meaning to name God , my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grand@@ father .
use approved .
belonging to affili@@ ation means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grand@@ father cri@@ es .
in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan we@@ pt sore around his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir family , which he was not allowed to close to his arms in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grand@@ father , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colon@@ ised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all up to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that the first pilot &apos;s bom@@ b of history has been disc@@ arded over a Muslim country in a century ago .
it means to know that at the same time the grand@@ father of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir@@ ish sub@@ title of British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he conducted the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were air@@ planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I was ever and pre@@ aching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion , goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ broken history .
it means remember@@ ing that , four@@ teen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across every continent , to Iraq , to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means to know that the self @-@ moral rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means to know that when a trag@@ edy will pun@@ ish the US , and the susp@@ ect carries a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means to know that four @-@ four@@ teen years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave called Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our ident@@ ities that are inc@@ ited with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but to fail to communicate them to others .
the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1,7 billion holds more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing doubts &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is const@@ ituted in Muslim registr@@ ars , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration officer who takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that exclu@@ des its borders vis @-@ à @-@ vis people from just the countries that bom@@ bard it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ List &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely accepts Arab@@ s and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the wars we lead and the bom@@ bs that we shed on Muslim countries .
because of the stories that we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists at North@@ western University participants showed a scienti@@ fic@@ ally un@@ correct picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with regard to evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to un@@ veil the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous im@@ prints that we dis@@ soci@@ ate in our news editorial offices .
at least , there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing von Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ .@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to multip@@ ly Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ KI@@ STAN@@ CE , Muslim , American Super@@ hel@@ din - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned with this difficult global time point in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspir@@ acy the@@ or@@ ists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years ago , it had not yet been given ; now they domin@@ ate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the re@@ alities and the story that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who today made me an invol@@ un@@ tary Muslim .
things I have left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b in my speech .
things that might aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that constitutes our humanity , a story might listen , where one is made to another .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Ber@@ kel@@ ey con@@ stell@@ ations take place within the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why tell me here at this T@@ ED@@ x talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are being led and people through the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public imagination , four decades ago himself Scientific of Stan@@ ford was .
we have to ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions after the role of being conscious and un@@ aware of the &quot; other &quot; ; as it was my girl@@ friend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he has already broken down countries and &quot; to other made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , the number of stories in their original language is a possible response .
global Vo@@ ices recently reported on a different initiative by Steven Bird , the conf@@ lic@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of great cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has conducted events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project apply :
the mass ext@@ in@@ ction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is often associated with understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to appreciate , to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers first introduce and translate their history in their own language and then explain them in English .
even though the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devot@@ ion and their representation lead to the fact that the list@@ eners agree on it .
they call forth laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ or Kon@@ ate also sei@@ zes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for their country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ ables from the rab@@ bit and the P@@ avian in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the importance of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is that to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a broad gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened to !

Puerto Rico demands re@@ arm@@ ament of sovereign deb@@ ts from the USA
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public deb@@ ts of Puerto Rico , which had risen to 72 million US dollars , various religious and bourgeois organisations participated in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 ; the march started in the capit@@ ol of the capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano por la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the ne@@ ural examination of deb@@ ts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church assembly of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of the re@@ arm@@ ament of debt have also submitted a pet@@ ition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the Puerto R@@ ican people claim that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for deb@@ ts are responsible for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial aud@@ iting and a Ste@@ ering Committee without any personal interest in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding re@@ mun@@ eration that acts in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the Puerto R@@ ican people refuse to pay a gu@@ ilt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be reconc@@ iled with decre@@ asing pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the state alliance integrated sovereign territory of the USA - suff@@ ers from a severe financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit organisation without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law for national responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extern@@ ally imposed measures will risk without the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration had the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , dedicated itself to the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of published books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book of Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book published last year and released here is a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction , it means :
this book would like to discuss how movement is built for free knowledge and what the real costs associated with .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on page to look beyond the fog that surro@@ unds our news feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who have been im@@ pris@@ oned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
seeing how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for participation in a free culture , many of us have started thinking about their own destin@@ ies , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given up in this process of times of extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the cust@@ ody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel had taken the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as the in@@ sider of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his abo@@ de and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in extending access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Bar@@ ry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that established bas@@ cu@@ le , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prot@@ otypes was fo@@ ret@@ old than the work he began with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persi@@ an influences .
at that time Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after working with this work , the IS would put everything in it , that architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
so far , Bas@@ sel could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life with it , dre@@ aming of freedom and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel taught me English even when he was in cust@@ ody .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked him . he has taught other incar@@ nations to read , write and speak English .
Bas@@ sel opened my door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners , how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a pro@@ s@@ ling that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in cust@@ ody .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for a year .
she sm@@ ug@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available ro@@ yalty @-@ free .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens every time you visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and guards
I forget the prison of the prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words ,
which I wear with passion
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I will let another piece of my soul leave with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and smile about your absence and smile .
I persu@@ ade myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the incar@@ cer@@ ation of Bas@@ sel , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote :
one year goes , my soul
during the course of time
I in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ sel &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime since the beginning of 2011 , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared .
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nest@@ y International , until 2016 , at least 17,@@ 723 Syri@@ ans died in det@@ ention .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we reiter@@ ate our demand today in the hope we have to do for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption more sentenced director to prison again on previous post
Moz@@ ambi@@ an responded with anger to a corruption case , in which a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence in the state apparatus at which corruption was committed .
it is about Di@@ o@@ dino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants on account of the disp@@ rop@@ ortion of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose advice Cam@@ b@@ aza stood between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re@@ setting to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with an opinion of the General Prosec@@ utor of the Republic , which evalu@@ ates the motion , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ b@@ aza , back to his old post , since the company did not perform discipl@@ ining proceedings after his det@@ ention .
however , many inhabitants do not mean the action well .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ eg@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clar@@ i@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step back@@ wards with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company also has to initiate a disciplinary process against the disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate .
the company appears to be silent , however , and does not make appropriate legal steps for the application of the respective functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ ambi@@ que social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resi@@ li@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence , and half of them had dinner .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating spe@@ eches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inf@@ li@@ ct damage .
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza would like to pay for his silence .
contradi@@ c@@ tory ! ( translated with Google Translate )
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ que and student of political science in Brazil says , the director had no mor@@ als :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state because he ins@@ ul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that has already so massi@@ vely ins@@ ul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza ple@@ aded not to return mor@@ ality to serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served itself by the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as an in@@ exhau@@ sti@@ ble money source and the state itself has become tired of this man who has been charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a th@@ ief is in j@@ ail :
th@@ ie@@ ves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison not only to be remembered for ever as the first independent president , but also as sharp , cutting @-@ edge and - inci@@ dentally - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was , when he confirmed vig@@ or@@ ously that &quot; an ambitious human being is capable of selling also the fa@@ ther@@ land for his amb@@ itions to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not that way . he changes the tactics but he does not turn away from his amb@@ itions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also rejected :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years and came free .
and today the company , in which he suc@@ cum@@ b to money , re@@ signed under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ ƒ@@ ι@@ ς fu ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means ch@@ ick@@ pe@@ as or don@@ or b@@ ushes . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although still being discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook ac@@ qui@@ res the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ev@@ apor@@ ama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese ty@@ pe@@ face ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely dis@@ ap@@ pointing con@@ not@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word in itself does not automatically trigger hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also Post@@ s , in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubts about his use , were cen@@ sored .
furthermore , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter sequence like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( Sp@@ alter@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ schl@@ ager A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was ext@@ ingu@@ ished today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ an - re@@ sembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to Facebook &apos;s initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech radic@@ ally nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ised that Facebook must be analy@@ tic before it all del@@ etes all posts that were suspected of spreading rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the automat@@ ism will not understand what you write on fac@@ to@@ ook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words side by side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to cur@@ tail their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who is spreading hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experience of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat proved that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is bann@@ ed from the social network :
... when I was aware of this new policy of Facebook , I posted a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to sign the Li@@ ken , posting and sharing of content for 24 hours , because the post was not correspon@@ ded to the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of Post@@ s of people who have no negative intentions or who simply attempt to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author gave his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
c@@ ens@@ ing such words will bring only more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also seems as if they started this without a local context or technical support and bann@@ ed such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Erb@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the mis@@ er@@ ased posts .
if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would give them a big turnover , it would be great .
fac@@ ebook automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now thinking about Facebook and deliberately write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts which did not contain hate speech but were removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to try out if Facebook remo@@ ves the post that contains the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to enhance their voices and their influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally hei@@ gh@@ ten the violence in the congregations in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to take control of the ou@@ trag@@ eous hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sites .
but rather than simply zen@@ ith the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running , looked more on context than on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end with the chil@@ dr@@ ens
a wedding ring in the sand .

the nur@@ ser@@ y is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country un@@ anim@@ ously decided a law to ban this practice , so that the married age now is 18 .
prior to this change of the marriage law , some members adher@@ ed to Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 there was a large public scre@@ am . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , a group leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state does not inter@@ fere , since that , age does not im@@ press the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this occurred despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contracting partner of the UN Children &apos;s Convention on Children under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 the Federal Stati@@ stical Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married from 1997 to 2007 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements , who were endeav@@ oring to abol@@ ish laws for children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation to say to the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , dam@@ n to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts were question@@ ed whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 the draft law was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and let the law pro@@ claim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave on Facebook a status update , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill for the child marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and not a single opposition .
after it has been decided beforehand in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed , because the laws were finally am@@ ended for children &apos;s marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who ar@@ ra@@ yed a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which spar@@ ked the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is almost every price .
while Abel Jackson of opinion was , it definitely took long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al@@ - Thomas , which states : , , outstanding news !
the marriage law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , - 35 - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
torture Mut@@ iny , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft amend@@ ment to the marriage law was approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 dep@@ u@@ ties and 35 of them were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all members who agree to have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the child marriage is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # Chil@@ ean Chil@@ d@@ hood Ant@@ abuse .
many thanks to all activists who challenged him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our dep@@ u@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aja announced his intention to take court steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to rede@@ em his promise .
while the General Prosec@@ utor Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj refused to act against the law , most social media users wanted to address the issue differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of speaking out of the discussion as general , in a way that we , would invite the state into our bedrooms , would simply specifically talk about that the state , our daughters from it , would be ab@@ used , that they may be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ worn men , who are opposed to them , &quot; would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children are legal or still the norm , even though there are laws which they do .

by mir@@ r@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can see Wikipedia content again
the Wikipedia website was published on January 18 , 2012 , contr@@ asting with the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and PI@@ PA copyright legislation in the United States , internationally ob@@ sc@@ ured .
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month Turkey has now opened the popular enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia of Wikipedia , based on crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle .
day by day it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ por@@ ters and fans of TV series are fighting against the blocking .
although many other Internet users are used to use dressing tools for blocked websites ( a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third biggest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles by Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Har@@ vard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world , when it comes to massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship from Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now multiple mirrors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ planetary File System ) , when the platform depos@@ ited all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alised pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator hosts ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
despite legal prohibition , the content is irre@@ voc@@ able .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after we &apos;ve heard the news ( about the block@@ age of Wikipedia ) , we put everything on putting snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the ability to read the content on a de@@ centralized and distributed way .
this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is just about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror site of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors when Wikipedia is locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mirror .
you access another URL that is not the original . that which you can see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server sends the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey .
this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for natural protection
a bo@@ iling r@@ hin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with po@@ or@@ ly positioned motives and well @-@ balanced colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera with him and try to gr@@ ati@@ fy the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une to the international stage .
and his birth@@ place right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started kne@@ eling pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities to gain global recognition for N@@ ept@@ une and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as fri@@ ghtening as they look like .
and he ought to know it , for he was already face to face with tig@@ ers :
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ cket appeared . he immediately sets up , we see us and he star@@ es through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for more &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ ters at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations .
check out some of these photos below .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women have the greatest care to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh , women give women that they respect the husband because of social pressure , and the fear of the consequences should they mis@@ use the norm .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convi@@ cted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a bog@@ us court and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married friend with a name .
the tradition of their wives also not to be called by the name is widespread among men . however , they have far less re@@ pris@@ als to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health personnel , and house@@ wives , entered a unique club and were thus quickly become the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
when one of 56 clubs exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the exploitation of the patri@@ archy .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to expos@@ ing practices such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and manages this club .
she reports how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion was women , who call their hus@@ bands not by name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not saying the name of their hus@@ bands , is a custom that they keep all du@@ ti@@ ly guilty and never question@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition test@@ i@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as a woman without mor@@ ality .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who has never mentioned her husband by the name of her husband , wanted to try at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still wei@@ gh for a long time after the video ends .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name .
with this confidence in the luggage Roh@@ ini started its first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked everyone , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean that they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equal ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in the married women never allowed to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that throughout the exercise she only til@@ ted forward , another decided to release all the accumulated fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing it .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in ad@@ ren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into the head of women : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understand@@ able and the situation was in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zinc red point on the fore@@ head pointing the sp@@ ouses :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the z@@ inc@@ est red point if he did it too .
he just laugh@@ ed and I stopped bearing him .
the other women have not completely stopped , but think they are now in a better position to choose , not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things about which they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things , for example how our ident@@ ities are tied to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say some things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes .
some women in the group have borne only sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most people &apos;s okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ist cur@@ ta to wear a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t trust .
after much contro@@ vers@@ y and discussion about the advantages of own dress code , the mor@@ ality related to the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini sm@@ ug@@ gled her own couple of Kur@@ tas ( shirts ) in a discussion round so that women could wear them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will make it .
on the question whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly into the rolling :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have only taken small steps so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped talking about the name of their husband .
some , including me , do it , but only if they are alone and are not with any other family members .
only one or two still say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now bear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot at any time on their fore@@ head .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the particles for more freedom of movement or their own clothing - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
as Roh@@ ini declares :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and tell other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

on the 29th of June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to settle into the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noticed 2016 during the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
people here have become quite quickly clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ i@@ chi Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! she was the Beat@@ les pl@@ aque in Japan . fifty years ago she was here in Tokyo .

the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les over@@ lives everything .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ Ged@@ en@@ kt@@ ag .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ oll John L@@ enn@@ on is supposed to represent or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the famous places connected with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , that is your 5 places you absolutely need to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Matthew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry F@@ ields ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ m@@ ages can sometimes not be bizar@@ rely enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ Ged@@ en@@ kt@@ ag .
exactly today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran over Abbey Road .
the same we did last year .
and of course some companies use the fan base also market @-@ oriented , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ ah@@ iro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! destiny Now is Beat@@ les @-@ Ged@@ en@@ kt@@ ag .

a new system of kid@@ n@@ apping of bald people for organ trading , supp@@ os@@ edly for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , troub@@ les the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and a part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently conf@@ essed that the organs of sh@@ aman are being used in Tanzania and Malawi .
there is the local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth , declared the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on bald @-@ headed men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group , the aim of assass@@ inations for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led the UN to carry out a mission in the South African country in order to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ st@@ ition and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ uto .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
este@@ em to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que are the goal of ritual attack , the mos@@ ambi@@ que police warned of the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the assass@@ inations took place .
Hus@@ site Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que said that the local police already followed the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , for supp@@ os@@ edly super@@ st@@ itious ritu@@ als , has commissioned the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambi@@ que ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the sacrifices in the head might have power , the riches gen@@ eri@@ ere .
in recent days three men with hair loss problems have been mur@@ dered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger &apos;s arms Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambi@@ que :
I would like to express E@@ IN MO@@ SA@@ BI@@ K , THE SI@@ CH , A country where people would have shame to go on the streets , dressed as if they would be ashamed of having sex against good notes , and others would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted , aimed at reaching rapid ri@@ chn@@ ess .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for f@@ law@@ less hum@@ or .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published within the framework of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the fall of the im@@ pris@@ oned Chinese dis@@ si@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the end of June .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ing ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demanded democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man , he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow him to permit treatment abroad .
while some countries crit@@ ici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations Educ@@ ational Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway and more Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway went into the Sto@@ cking after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government stated that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resu@@ me sal@@ mon exports to China , as exports have largely been blocked since 2010 .
after spreading the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .

&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him the possibility of treatment abroad in so far as he helped him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ person for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the emb@@ assy asked the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US emb@@ assy drew a fur@@ ious answer from China to itself , with the outside of the State Department that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to take inter@@ vening and ir@@ responsible observ@@ ations on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as travel and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mer@@ kle@@ y and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to un@@ conditi@@ onally release Li@@ u and his wife .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hoping that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Peking of the news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had big concerns if the vor@@ tex could over@@ shadow Li@@ u &apos;s visit to Hamburg .

on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide an adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ us An@@ ney told AF@@ P before that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always watched the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to talk to someone outside , including his attor@@ neys , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues :
Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to exemp@@ t the rights for the exercise of these rights .
France , 53 min
France &apos;s foreign ministry demanded China to release on June 29 , to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all the treatments he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information whether France will ultimately receive it .
Taiwan Head@@ quarters : Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Country Affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese law@@ gi@@ ver Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to permit the sick intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama - Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned with a statement on 28 June by Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took , and for which he was severely pun@@ ished , would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt personally very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore . Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stup@@ id as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
but according to Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , Singapore was supposed to be considered a city .
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the Chamber of Law@@ yers of the State of New York , the Minister re@@ marked that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city .
... no one has question@@ ed whether New York is a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rot@@ ate logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and dedication to create this precious land , we hear that we are ultimately not a country .
it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it ?
the reasons mentioned by Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , but in the face of this , he seemed in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
he has , on the other hand , def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently run by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re comes up from the author@@ it@@ arian powers that pret@@ end to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , because it fits better to their power .
in the end the last week of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am we were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ answers .
related questions he clo@@ thed with non @-@ responses of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our valued K Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take the effort to en@@ ligh@@ ten this point if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he pointed out the critic@@ isms that you should start reading the whole co @-@ ordin@@ ance of the conference to better understand the context of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the cap@@ tion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ even important , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who is the leader of an adol@@ es@@ cent generation , making such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what awaits me - whether I agree with them or not , but that is another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is really associated and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SEK Review sets the weak points of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am has committed a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ ger spokes@@ man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are regarded only as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in which country do the sovereign rights of the city come back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
as he plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet , Mr Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am &apos;s statements are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore afford their military service , do they defend only their city but not their country ?
whom does our prime minister have to pay back invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ID ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade for affir@@ mation , Singapore is and always has been a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this pro@@ position seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
your answers will be published here as part of a continuing series with rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and to be shown a different fac@@ et .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question I asked in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his convers@@ ational partner by asking personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my clar@@ ification usually follows the default answer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rock@@ y Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook in@@ war@@ dly when they are held for Americans , but don &apos;t bo@@ ther me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans will make a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I started travelling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neigh@@ bors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently we say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ use &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends who I admire very much .
it would not matter to me if you would like to switch me to Johnny from Dallas , for example .
with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , to be referred to as &quot; nice , &quot; basically means to be fun - just like the gentle , gentle but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has one of his own Canadian dou@@ bles ) .
if Canada was really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing in which one can encounter .
being harm@@ less means being in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not to deserve attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from things that happen around you .
I would even go so far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps simply cool polit@@ eness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans often talk about the fence with the neighbours .
we lack the warm , open friendliness , which I now connect with my American friends .
luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Just@@ in Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &apos; nice &apos; . our Prime Minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy .
Musik@@ video von Pop @-@ Band par@@ o@@ urs Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that is par@@ o@@ ding the jun@@ ta which took power in 2014 , and despite its promises to restore the civil government , the country continues to rule .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the rules he makes his girl@@ friend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not explicitly political , the music video is indirectly related to the ongoing military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook 1,@@ 254 times was divided and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists ordered the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , as it acts with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these photos of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ stic section 44 of the pro@@ visional constitution , which grants absolute decision power over important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setup change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics by the jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , super@@ vis@@ ing the online content and persons accused of having s@@ lan@@ dered the mon@@ archy to have prosec@@ uted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand sets a strict agreement against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ ät@@ s@@ bel@@ ei@@ digung ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , the war law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup d &quot; é@@ tat of the army .
one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts they warned that the purchase would be unnecessary and a waste of tax pay@@ ers .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black v@@ ans before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened long sentences , they should ins@@ ult the mon@@ archy .
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song showed members of the band that im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; Die Tri@@ bute von Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014 .

the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district .
now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ hic war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern districts in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya sh@@ ak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ ih@@ ava are in the co@@ al@@ pool of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
different ethnic groups such as Russi@@ ans , Greeks , de@@ preci@@ ation , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the largest part of the Russi@@ ans and the ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements became also known in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these cl@@ er@@ ical cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the population of the population was 16,@@ 000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 43,@@ 000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60 &apos;s , which are called Chr@@ u@@ zh@@ t@@ ch@@ kov@@ kas , represent symbo@@ lic@@ ally for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are covered and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha village I met a native older man .
he starts talking and it is hard for him to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens which served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded mag@@ nific@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha approximately fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ ow@@ ka , which houses one or two families , one can recognize in the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girl@@ friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter , the district administration delivers free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ g@@ ettes &quot;
about ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain in Ab@@ ch@@ asia &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial support from her daughter and insi@@ sts that instead she supports her young grand@@ children .
Gal@@ inas monthly rent are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;

when holidays are , we visit us .

&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; call T@@ ante G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A to her . &quot; they said we could build cour@@ g@@ ettes .

G@@ aly@@ as &apos;s talk partner Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the village life before the war .
despite the relative , who live in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ ch@@ asia was simply gone ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 child money for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pig@@ s , cows , co@@ cks and ch@@ ick@@ ens .
she tells us that it was a very fri@@ ghtening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her fears .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation ends , a little boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him behind .
he plays with the ball rolling the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball scre@@ aming .
while they run , some of them throw stones onto the abandoned buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood who care for in@@ convenience in their lives .

on the way of migrants passing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spect@@ acle frame and gold @-@ coloured ear rings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear form .
she is called Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about € 2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Ha@@ iti@@ an migrants arrive here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez tells the people in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
where are You M@@ um Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on cart@@ ons outside .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys drugs that they cannot pay , she mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m the swe@@ pt away from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often travel together the route and that Afri@@ cans already speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a building worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup Football World Championship .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says sm@@ iling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells us that her guests often send her text messages when they went away to gre@@ et her or tell her about the course of her journey .
she declares that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus ticket to numerous African migrants is sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered to them his house for a dollar spent the night .
at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchen outside .
Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single educ@@ ator , offered him a roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests again .
in the ais@@ les , the travellers consul@@ ted cal@@ m@@ ly their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also no@@ stal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she fl@@ atter in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care , who has made her a customer , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laugh@@ s sad , while she briefly presents her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ eron &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have already gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users will be attrac@@ ting their own .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the phone users in Tian@@ shan district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which it as@@ signs the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Communication , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the authorities also used the app to use the app for more than fighting terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had replaced messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the communication of the police , the app was able to identify and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main feature is the block@@ age of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and remot@@ ely control their home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; might enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manip@@ ulate or ste@@ al the home network of a person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while reports of digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dar@@ ker for those living in distant , oppressed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit dis@@ comfort and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ or and surveillance measures as well as routine internet de@@ preci@@ ation .
based on Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; published news in China , the cen@@ sored messages published in China showed photos from a check@@ point where polic@@ emen crew indi@@ sc@@ rimin@@ ately checked whether they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people will install the app within 10 days .
if you &apos;re det@@ ained at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be im@@ pris@@ oned up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they forced the people to use devices designed for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the recovery technology .
we are back in Ma@@ o China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( br@@ anded bÃ ¶ dens ) also released a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which suggests that the software can lift the pass@@ words requirement of a Windows operating system and therefore un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the pres@@ crip@@ tions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the city party council to minimize the dissemin@@ ation of illegal content .
all government agencies , authorities and associated institutions , including universities and research institutions , are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs , until August 1 , their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media storage cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to be identified and destroyed . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane described his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far away from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realise that you are alone in a place where everything has van@@ ished .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able both from the inside and from the outside .
one that makes all glory to its name .
one that has struck down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when the reality reco@@ vers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the act@@ ress , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters are transformed into essence of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es to death .
all doubt dis@@ solve in smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even when Earth moves on the axis of evil . it becomes clear to you that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone set up stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the leader of the Security Service - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the districts sought , only my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , mot@@ ion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that is up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had a bit cal@@ med after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by sh@@ outing several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I listened to my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt cour@@ ageous enough to find together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we alli@@ ed to a glorious image filled with my expectations and completely fulfilled .
in such a moment you realize that you liber@@ ated the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the Military Security Building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice , after you gave them all the way to the office of the Security Service from the Body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only bra@@ ve enough to scre@@ am when we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his well @-@ filled eyes set up on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are really sad to look at my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I then did has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps at the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my cause when I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the short@@ est conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I didn &apos;t regret the word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put it in sing@@ ular and his father equally with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father right away with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stri@@ fe of this cur@@ sed pro@@ position is up to this day in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture , which I was exposed to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I scre@@ am the farm .
in the first office I leave everything that I wear with myself .
then back through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a cor@@ ridor to the individual cells .
I gave all the details exactly before I looked after the room .
other than usual , they have given me a larger cell this time .
I have to share her with just one more pris@@ oner and can immediately put me without waiting for her permission .
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the officer left the cell , and I attacked a well @-@ tried communication method : hit the f@@ ist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ sth@@ ä@@ ft@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he responded to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a respected middle aged man who looks similar to me and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the perfect darkness , no striking facial features cannot be seen in me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers connected his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will immediately hear .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would leave him if I remain .
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive out all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ en on the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them scre@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light which presented us to the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; all@@ usion on 13th S@@ ure of the Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to be heard . &quot;
thus the secret was revealed : to protect the state security from us and prevent that we release the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ischen dial@@ ect - so they played their conf@@ essi@@ onal black@@ mailing list and betra@@ yed the close range of their world view .
this is not a house , this is not a country here ; it is a curse they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ an into a hero .
I looked after the audit@@ orium and meet with Abu I@@ mad , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems like that .
he cat@@ ches a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than join these di@@ aries and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I have used it to myself , not to answer .
I can really no longer tell exactly when ins@@ ults and blo@@ ws have become an ordinary communication instrument after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any voice in me said that I had to get used to get used to pun@@ ish myself , even though I did nothing to make this punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to s@@ nat@@ ch me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ cks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er is on your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot compete with him and you cannot with@@ hold your cri@@ es .
my cri@@ es were not enough , so they inter@@ changed the tube through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a gar@@ bage collector , or if it belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined in order to present to us the , from their point of view , great invention of a giant cable .
within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still in the row .
I had lost all the feeling of my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the H@@ enk@@ er re@@ marked the cooling down and found no favour with it , which is why he acted as next to an electri@@ cally charged rod .
power penet@@ rated my whole body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood .
my semi @-@ naked body , which lay stretched on the ground , was the perfect electric conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been at midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which seemed to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus mit dir , Ass@@ fu@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted yo@@ ung@@ ster : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and walk , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he locks to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , sometimes to his couch .
but what one can rely on is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his with nic@@ ot@@ ine de@@ filed lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( about : farmers ) .
for six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and question@@ ed her well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape .
with his music , which often deals with issues like ori@@ ental , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world .
with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his thinking , and he can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he doesn &apos;t open it openly , he won a special incl@@ ination against the American foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have something to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation &quot; - he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own life circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I &apos;m a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he dissolved in water Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a scor@@ ching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the pressures run lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the s@@ wa@@ ths of the K@@ ent cigar@@ ette in the nose first and foremost of freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if one thro@@ ws a look into neighbouring countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hence , it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water , in order not to land in j@@ ail .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan said a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Bro@@ therhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual front @-@ singer Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradi@@ cts the cultural and traditional standards of the country and the main reason for the concert charts .
the dep@@ u@@ ties and former press spokes@@ men of the Islamic Co@@ alition , Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b , said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; just &quot; was canc@@ eled because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m , which in@@ dem@@ ni@@ fies the ancient legitim@@ acy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes throughout the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which continues to be chosen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement should probably not be simply sei@@ zing rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually reflects an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ all@@ ising reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b moved traditional gender standards to glue by depic@@ ting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex @-@ hel@@ i@@ ke sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a well @-@ known unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should trust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , the number of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ ours of honour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased in Jordan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ orary mur@@ ders in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still more ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support women who have attempted murder or domestic violence to provide adequate ways .
according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to danger of in@@ tra @-@ family violence must &quot; be kept in j@@ ail for a certain period of time , &quot; and for their release often a long @-@ term bureaucr@@ atic expend@@ itu@@ res and the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary that the woman will have nothing to happen .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s music also enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from subjects that are long as tab@@ u in his country .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b argu@@ ed that his work is political , but adm@@ its that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit calls on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot separate from politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was judged by politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are politically political can be carried on .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one can get in his words , &quot; that can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gene@@ ity or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals and that comments on equality between LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been extensively cen@@ sored by 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya , to later notice that his comments were torn from the context , twi@@ sted and cen@@ sored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a modified version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als is not bound to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ h , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks itself : if Abu Nu@@ is , who later should work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;s Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tion@@ ed attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service established several former members of the government and members of the teacher &apos;s association , argu@@ ing that they had critic@@ ised the problems that were deeply rooted in social media comments on the problems that were deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is continuous giving and taking . Jordan has driven M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that is what H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ght@@ ful and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arab@@ s , of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he not only dre@@ amed of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a real and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not through bom@@ bs , scatter symbols and artificial kind of democr@@ acies . at least , he hopes that .
as far as it is , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to over@@ lap and therefore also resist resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extr@@ avag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ bs are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is assumed that there is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the party , the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years have been handed down and come from a time in which armies from the west mar@@ ched into the north @-@ east to force the indigenous people of the region , the em@@ ishi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
it is hard to imagine how big these parts are ...
a community center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two carri@@ ages are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a stunning way to spend the summer :

I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ high side@@ car was unbelie@@ vable .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

rare , outer appearance and body care were as important as in this history , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate occupation like the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital - a region with a very high crime rate where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traff@@ icking are common@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population in this region could not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to the fact that more and more normal people go into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there experts compete against each other in order to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hair@@ dressing tools and to obtain training in the hair@@ dressing art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered have seen do@@ zens of young people that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; Love message to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who we know ?
is it not much more important , people who feel exp@@ elled , accommo@@ dating ?
this is exactly the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ rag@@ a from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign of Cart@@ as por la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters of gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ ors .
only recently their country was the venue of a historic event , and they wanted to contribute to this : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the FAR@@ C gu@@ err@@ illa movement ( German : revolutionary armed forces Colombia ) , which constitutes the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the treaty of peace was considered so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
but before the Colom@@ bi@@ ans there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
Gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and carried their arms around the clock , must now integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which has become ac@@ custom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ fare , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian people would have to join together and help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : so far , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 69@@ 00 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa figh@@ ter - to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as Inspiration for the Camp@@ a@@ ign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose on the world summit of Nobel Peace Prize winners , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but those forgotten that they need much more .
he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent action .
so the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former war@@ ri@@ ors of the FAR@@ C , who now have to find their place in society and have to build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war on a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected in the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region on March 19 .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipal administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ art Foundation , travelled to the camp to transfer the letters personally .
the members of the FAR@@ C did so as they had done before to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelie@@ vable how many different feelings one can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies between , &quot; the policy scientist Manuela J@@ im@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila told later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after we passed the letters , a former war@@ rior led me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I looked into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa figh@@ ter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed lay a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ werfer , a dead@@ ly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life someone wrote me something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; I suddenly answered the tears over the che@@ eks .
I h@@ ug@@ ged him all the way and set me next to the pom@@ e@@ gran@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry for the war too , was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this figh@@ ter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life than war . to join the FAR@@ C was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society there that wa@@ its for us with open arms .
so far I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace re@@ igns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
for the pre@@ lu@@ de , students and some leaders of the FAR@@ C came together to a round of discussion .
the students were all grown up as already war and the FAR@@ C already acted in secret .
that is why the FAR@@ C leaders explained the history of the organisation , their ide@@ als , and gave insights into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social in@@ justice from the state to the whole Colom@@ bian people has worked out . now , where we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can help shape society more fairly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magn@@ itude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
hearing those people who had never heard heard yet and had no right to vote , and to see that the people I often saw as monsters and even hate people with beautiful emotions that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and can give a smile and hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the town of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
colum@@ bi@@ ans have been proph@@ esi@@ ed that peace would rule after the dis@@ arm@@ ament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to take up arms , lift themselves up and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we at FAR@@ C now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology , they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will be faced with many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ su@@ mo@@ wa and the first publication on the website OC Media took place .
hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hor@@ ror activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months on the persecution of pregnant women in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the threat posed by a D@@ amo@@ cl@@ es@@ hip over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community is not only created overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what &apos;s happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published to address the deteri@@ oration , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , arrested suspic@@ ious que@@ er men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
since childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ es had experienced the gender equality of their wife , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
in fear of her life she moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as an hon@@ orary hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Dag@@ est@@ an , a lady who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents made the lap by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was watching a few shopping bags from the seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you honor the family ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and wo@@ ke up in the hospital again .
apparently , some women had received everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ch wounds in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in what nur@@ se were you laid - in the men or women of the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
for that I am very thank@@ ful to him .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he was resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last February I got threats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they called me , wrote to me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neigh@@ bors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
they created absurd demands : some said to me , I have to prove it by running at the top without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had@@ n &apos;t changed my sex that everything was just bad speech and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has sh@@ amed not only your family , but the entire Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay down a rope around the neck .
fortunately the neigh@@ bors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car with dar@@ ken@@ ed window pan@@ es and a number plate with a 95 dr@@ auf .
after it happened the third time it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights @-@ rights friends checked out the Num@@ mer@@ n@@ schil@@ der - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought her without regi@@ stering me , without notice , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you do not believe , you would be in security just because you left the country ?
our people know already in which hotel you place . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still get in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality , that is a t@@ abo@@ o topic .
some traditional Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements I still carry in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this mental barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I really try to look at how the person looks out , remin@@ is@@ cent of her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for him I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who was im@@ pris@@ oned for one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he told no people were arrested and tor@@ tured during Ram@@ ad@@ an , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not lock up a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
with this , I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced by blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are there still gay men det@@ ained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend told me there would be not so many .
if , then especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives in order to stand up Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but di@@ pped specifically to radic@@ alize themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : is this only a guess or do you have a source of this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was im@@ pris@@ oned for one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard grew .
there has been nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even there when these people were taken .
but until now they were not presented as band@@ its , there have been no reports on this yet . however , we susp@@ ect that such actions are possible .
why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to sh@@ ave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wor@@ e my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think , already before 2003 I was already well @-@ known as I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to lead us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the stone age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were pl@@ u@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wor@@ e Rö@@ hren@@ je@@ ans and short ops .
the security ministry of the Sh@@ aria has never curved me just a hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several ben@@ ches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been off@@ ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they simply closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never off@@ ended me , never hun@@ ted and never sm@@ itten .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace hold ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about mor@@ als on television .
he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
those who had sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed before , looked at you at once with suspic@@ ion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the Republic was steadily deteri@@ or@@ ating .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA .
in addition , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ ups , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t have a cent for it .
I discovered these people myself when I sh@@ ook off the breeding places .
I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ right .
this is how nature is , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to proph@@ esy with foam before the mouth that there are no g@@ ays with them .
the Dag@@ est@@ ans have who , the Cab@@ ar@@ din@@ er , who , the Russi@@ ans also have which ; on the whole planet there are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant to hear what to hear .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ ad@@ an - live with men .
do you know many think of trans@@ it@@ ism to men who love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different types of feeling to be exact , different ways of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n against an increase in su@@ icide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the last few months there has been a strong increase in self @-@ murder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August revers@@ ed the des@@ perate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , the li@@ mel@@ ight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ah in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , the in@@ ability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous .
a video made on YouTube held the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
some people quickly managed to ext@@ ingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only su@@ icide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists on site war@@ n that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - H@@ amid Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .

the region in which a majority of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran has been sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its li@@ vel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi Mon@@ archy took power and in 1925 under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields coming in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population only gets a little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated conditions , hunger and priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime den@@ ies systematically the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arab@@ s in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a large number of tribes , the waters from the Arabic areas into the Persi@@ an areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are flying .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dro@@ ught , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi youth rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who are looking for a job , finished primary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ ih@@ a , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of su@@ ici@@ des among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
Doh@@ a said that especially unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persi@@ ans and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the adjustment process :
since function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i is depri@@ ved of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arab@@ s and to force them to earn their li@@ vel@@ ihood outside their home of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i and so be employed as even Arab names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , let alone speak Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes .
given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to end@@ ure , human rights activ@@ ist alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world w@@ akes up and takes note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is prevent@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I do not identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women face a glass ceiling sooner or later , and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer double and triple below .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I come to speak on skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black women women , on black women in LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention the way we have always been mis@@ used , both in and out of the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists have been silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but are all agreed that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lift their voices up and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist motivated violence , which we are exposed to black women in a double way .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities and types of origin deserve less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls are often referred to school with a migration background as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering from domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want that all women , all men and all men , have the same rights to all men and all men . on the other hand , I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands , who ref@@ uses to take into account in@@ just@@ ices in their thinking that relates both to the sex and the skin color of a person .
I &apos;m exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women repeatedly and again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 1851 in their speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to sust@@ ain an ideology in which the black woman in a historical sense is a men@@ aced and mar@@ gin@@ alised being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join group@@ ings , which , moreover , through cultural appropri@@ ation absor@@ bs our customs and customs to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c programme .
I will no longer try to tell white women the importance of the over@@ lap of skin color and sex . for some of them continue to keep silent the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and limit themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to release myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of the orph@@ an@@ age , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of being campa@@ ign@@ ing for a white femin@@ ist paradi@@ gm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we have black women to define ourselves according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing &apos;s : how we can defend ourselves by defining us on our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , emotional , physical and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped , which constitute the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement by which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , as in this paradi@@ gm I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradi@@ gm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life has neither passed nor ignored , nor rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled again and again over the past seven years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the Water@@ ke@@ eper Alliance non @-@ governmental organisation - a subsidiary of Water@@ ke@@ eper Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water channels in Iraq , as well as local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was fil@@ med and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary filmm@@ aker and multimedia journalist in Er@@ bil , Iraq .

Paragu@@ ays Women and her difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group women represents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The cr@@ ying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ e@@ frau@@ bin ) reporting on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become violent against her .
since the end of their relationship , some time had passed and the police said their statement would be put into the acts , but more could not be done .
when another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena was showing for mal@@ treatment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez did not use anything .
a few days later , the second woman moved back to her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women ever state advertisement in general , they generally do not receive support from the State .
in many cases women are also financi@@ ally dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit violence must be victims of violence at all in the law enforcement authorities .
Cont@@ act@@ 1 blo@@ ws and Stati@@ stic@@ s- 2 Un@@ seen Mis@@ acts and a legal system that nothing under@@ min@@ uses 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation pun@@ ches and statistics
it is hard to find out how many women are really mist@@ re@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues in the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the available numbers are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 people participated in domestic violence during the District State At@@ tor@@ ney Office . 70 % of them went to violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in the courts of peace . also here 86 % of the ads of women came .
in the adver@@ ts , 40 % of women said that they were physically mal@@ treated , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse .
these statistics do not show the true magn@@ itude of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minist@@ ress Ana Bai@@ ardi only few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; to any woman who is rep@@ aid in Paraguay because of mental mist@@ re@@ ation , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on any woman that is ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not an own criminal act , law enforcement agencies cannot adequ@@ ately document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until August 2016 , journalists included at least 12 cases of genocide in the country .
the co @-@ ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman died because of violence through men .

invisible Mis@@ acts and a judicial system that under@@ takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do it , but after that she should be regre@@ t@@ ted .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but two years later she carried out psych@@ ic violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize :
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are fool@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ical if he had ever lifted the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had enjoyed this so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain blame .
Victoria Santos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner mal@@ treated her .
Victoria is a member of the Network Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) made up of women who are all victims of abuse .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ orian case everything started with mental abuse .
her weal@@ thy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertis@@ ements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , they did not receive any support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ predic@@ table legal fight between Paraguay and her home country in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the announcement of abuse is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems when applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was deb@@ ated in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ E@@ lla ( # für@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement ( # non @-@ don@@ or ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
the original draft of the law stip@@ ulates that Fem@@ ci@@ d is to be declared an independent criminal act and har@@ sh@@ er harder to pun@@ ish as it is the case already in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the legislative text was changed in a few points , in order to also win the dep@@ u@@ ties for the law that would be p@@ aving the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions that are fundamentally bann@@ ed in Paraguay and be pun@@ ished with up to five years &quot; imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original bill of legislation had fore@@ seen the bulk of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) process costs which must bear the victims of violence at the present time , if they just want to reim@@ bur@@ se an indication and wish to receive secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial means for this :
in Paraguay , mal@@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here a re@@ thinking has to take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal .
he who is silent in view of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators .
we have to reim@@ bur@@ se as long as mal@@ treatment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been changed , among other things , a passage that led the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack its victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the fil@@ ing of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of parts of the law is regarded as a major set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ e@@ frau@@ bin ) reporting on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the affected persons .
independent media in Oman a year after the ban on a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a resolution by the Information Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is published on the website of the For@@ bidden Newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Afgh@@ an authorities have concluded the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ an .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he is serving a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and placed before court , but later came again .
Oman has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having dism@@ is@@ sed his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to its role as the only sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , supreme commander of the armed forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Affairs , President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ an &apos;s rule is characterized by the harsh efforts of security forces , notably of domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , civil liber@@ ties , including press freedom , limit@@ ing and in@@ timi@@ dating human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically restri@@ ct peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , also activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) until it was bann@@ ed by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested after the paper had appeared in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 with the title of &quot; high @-@ level parties tied hands to justice . &quot; it was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in court decisions .
in the report , government officials accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman , to raise a judgment in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was invited by the ISS before the Special Department and arrested on his arrival from the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS established the dep@@ uty chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as chief editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the instruction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and dissemin@@ ation of the newspaper on any way , including online , is prohibited from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place before the court in Mas@@ kat .
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both indi@@ cted for distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the pre@@ stige of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of a prohibition of publication and s@@ lan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three year prison sentences and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ an ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . furthermore , a one @-@ year professional ban was imposed on the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the dissemin@@ ation of material , which could represent a danger to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a damage deposit of 5000 om@@ ani ri@@ al ( 13,@@ 000 US dollars ) was arrested and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the App@@ eals Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i at a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was dism@@ is@@ sed in Mas@@ kat on 10 April 2017 . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison on 10 April 2017 . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the App@@ eals Court also pointed out the decision by the Ministry of Information to close the paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper is still exposed to attacks by the government of the Ottoman government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an instruction to extend the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information held a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and which the minister once again appe@@ aled against the decision of the Court of App@@ eal to restore the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists in the newspaper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press was injured in Oman in recent times .
other injuries include the closure of the website of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Afgh@@ an authorities :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ conditi@@ onally ;
2 . create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . under any circum@@ stance that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial sh@@ ep@@ herds .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blog@@ gers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighboring states by promoting freedom of opinion and association , and the right to gather , support and protect themselves peace@@ fully .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Fig@@ ure takes place with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely or even mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons why medical research is carried out on @-@ site : for a lack of healthcare , many medicines and vac@@ cines are missing , covering the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more severe consequences in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for resear@@ ching these diseases by pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
second , research that is carried out by African scientists is helping to build own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ is@@ iana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ b@@ astic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( dis@@ claimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( AG@@ M ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ pler national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostics testing for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
what do you think about the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
that must change , otherwise we will always remain recei@@ vers instead of being makers themselves .
the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
AG@@ M : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
how is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research on space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and inf@@ ectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from this .
how can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
the system that magazines are only accessible for payment ( the so @-@ called Pay@@ wall ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that covers solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ aka , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NA@@ SA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many let@@ tu@@ als he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he couldn &apos;t use it for breeding .
the patents do not only contain for individual varieties , but also for specific properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or ru@@ ff@@ led leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been registered for more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ ridges . due to this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security around the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on is still breeding a salad , but he now needs longer , since his work continues to be more and more difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if in a river there is a b@@ oul@@ der to which I must d@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far on sal@@ ads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when they stand trial , no one can breed any new kind of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot; it is therefore as good as possible and tries to breed those traits that he wants .
however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to not use any material protected as intellectual property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the US and anywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bre@@ eders ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red ro@@ asting sal@@ at of variety outlet in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative für &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) is inspired by the free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was called into existence to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ SS@@ I , US bre@@ eders are able to agree that others can freely use the seed @-@ bred seeds .
however , this does not mean that they cannot continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others to breed their seeds in order to breed their own varieties , and do not immediately so@@ w - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents .
do@@ zens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects for the future
for the emer@@ itus professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in Ma@@ dison and O@@ SS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the ability to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds are therefore playing a role in larger contex@@ ts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultiv@@ ating seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stres@@ ses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables , grains , gene@@ tically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed industry , &quot; says he and takes on the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , whose recent example is to buy , for example , on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetable is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative commit themselves to keep their seed freely available to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered because the available gene pool is shr@@ inking because of the increasingly widespread intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus more and more limited .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ SS@@ I , was engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all cartridge characteristics is protected as intellectual property , making it usable for plant bre@@ eders either at all or just terri@@ bly .
for other plants there are not such estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by assume that mass @-@ built plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or car@@ r@@ ots .
a question of view
plants are cultivated in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from such ones , through which their taste or colour improves up to those due to which they flour@@ ish in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders takes more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changing conditions by climate change are much worse predic@@ table .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto ackno@@ wle@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradi@@ cts the belief that intellectual property should encourage other bre@@ eders , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent exp@@ ired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not in@@ hibit innovations , but promotes it by providing the public with more material and expertise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mort@@ on sees this other : 20 years of waiting until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly not promoting innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to grow plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the battle already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incenti@@ ves are not attractive to us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it is made impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; altogether Mort@@ on interfer@@ ed with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eders , we ultimately have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Car@@ ol De@@ ppe , plant bre@@ eder in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ SS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who bre@@ eds a variety also bre@@ eds its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , are required for their cultivation of mass her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , breeding in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that are moving across international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , they create the majority of smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the experiment , or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on is looking for sal@@ ads in his ken@@ nel .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on also believes that bre@@ eders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than corporations that patented .
I constantly need new material for my catalog , because I know that my competitors can sell my own varieties in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , one is protected for 20 years before competition , with which one makes it quite easy in my opinion . &quot; worldwide resonance
although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which itself describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . the centre with farmers is working together and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed and sell their own .
the German organisation Agre@@ col is working on an open @-@ source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SS@@ I obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( regulations for bre@@ eders differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ SS@@ I obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conventi@@ onally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conventi@@ onally bred plants .
however , one explanation is not a law ; now it is at the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , H@@ iv@@ os established a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ ent@@ ing seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos; Program for Open Source seed systems , declares that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open source seed systems , for which the official starting signal will be scheduled next year .
a merger of environmental and development aid groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - publ@@ ishes a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report . it represents the opinion that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , ex@@ changing and improving seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context from the Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I hopes that more people will soon recognize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food@@ stu@@ ffs has especially paid attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human Rights Organization and Blog are the latest C@@ ens@@ or@@ ship goals in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock up content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , document@@ ing human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August has published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised this step and promised to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains in spite of this attack and the ridi@@ cu@@ le of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . although it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I affir@@ ms that all technical possibilities are exploited to overcome the block@@ age and not to give up . we ins@@ ist on fulfilling our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 web pages more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based Al J@@ aze@@ era network for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of web side locks to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dissemin@@ ation of columns and articles that he does not write access@@ able websites and media for Egypt .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the apparatus of the Egyptian government itself , even the goal of an attack .
Blog@@ ger , the publisher in which Zi@@ adas blog is given a home , on the other hand is more accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how the police exerc@@ ised physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking by the government and reflected what this means to him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old but has in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of the blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , so it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been able to give me the feeling of a si@@ ege , an arrest , an attempt of murder , un@@ loading at the national Security Council , blocking blo@@ gs and any other website I worked for .
2 ) They have proven that I didn &apos;t write nothing for nothing . in other words , my words have an influence , even if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
however , after having locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the bra@@ ve walk the way through to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , the Egyptian authorities blocked pages from 24th May to 06@@ th August 133 websites . this gave technical tests to the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers by circum@@ vent@@ ing Internet c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites which V@@ PN@@ s offer began .
such practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content that Egypt users could have access to .
the situation is also wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the vote decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which it can proceed against these acts .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Jan@@ eiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .
the Brazilian army was deployed in the fav@@ elas in N@@ iter@@ ó@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro , during the government crisis .

day by day newspapers throughout Brazil report with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Jan@@ eiro , the second largest city in the country and home of many postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 year old in school was shot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every second day a police officer in Rio de Jan@@ eiro is assass@@ in@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; th@@ ie@@ ves ro@@ b pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the terrible wave of violence reached the highest level in 2017 for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called on the UN to interv@@ ene .
reports such as these have become common@@ place and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published on 16 August the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the paper as follows :
extra will continue to report on crimes that occur in every metro@@ polis on the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crime , etc . everything that happens however from the civil@@ ised standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
it is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war of war in a country that does not recognize war at all .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes on :
we are aware that a war dis@@ sident , when he is dist@@ orted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , who only shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and its partners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; explo@@ res the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than it benefits ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oliv@@ eira ar@@ gues against the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a just@@ ification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it more difficult to account for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ent negle@@ ct of public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro is greater than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Jan@@ eiro , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is wrong according to Cec@@ í@@ lia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ats per federal state , Rio is on No.@@ 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia points out , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these security policy measures included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the police unit established by the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a Fav@@ ela by using a massive police body and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP lasted several years after several reports on sh@@ ik@@ es and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under attack .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux c@@ ited from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not meet the criteria laid down by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the grad@@ ation of the situation in Rio as a war also draws to serious consequences for the people .
this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . this includes entering into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is an in@@ comprehen@@ sible point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; wander@@ ing spheres . &quot;
war hin or her , fact is that the residents of the fav@@ elas in Rio continue to suffer .
one week it is now that the police force the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit seller died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helicop@@ ter .

many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massac@@ re of Assad &apos;s regime was perpet@@ rated on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , the rebels controlled by rebels have been under si@@ ege , which led people to rely on locally produced or through tun@@ nels and control points .
due to the lon@@ gl@@ asting block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ re@@ achable for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ part , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and perform the project together with the NGO al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods in Syria and are only very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their nutritional value makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tly of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years he has been fighting to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to know &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian Crow@@ d@@ funding platform c@@ ando in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge about plant@@ ing fung@@ i , so Dr. Lei@@ la belongs to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to c@@ ando until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel short@@ age , locally produced fuels are used in plastics to supply generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of mushrooms from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the fung@@ i @-@ breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking of si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
dissemin@@ ation of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ du@@ es ( such as paper , tea , coff@@ e@@ em@@ aker , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and si@@ ege will become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis regions and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the interview with Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la was done by Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b and translated by Eli@@ as A@@ bo@@ u Ja@@ ou@@ de .
Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district capit@@ als in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were gr@@ assi@@ oned in the week before in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government proclaimed a stat@@ eh@@ ood last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires have also been registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 frac@@ tures that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande had a similar trag@@ edy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European fore@@ stry surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite recordings , some 50@@ 0.000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon area .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
quite Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a destiny ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017
some of Twitter users shared pictures :

numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into the happ@@ enings :
the se@@ eable trag@@ edy
the goal of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and anti @-@ fire prevention measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to contain the extent of the trag@@ edy as far as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al from Portugal &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farmers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper : &quot; &quot; &quot;
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are do@@ zens of reports of open roads surrounding fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar trag@@ edy would have happened in June , as the streets were locked very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building permits in locations with high fire risk are question@@ ed .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the wh@@ ale form , which the government had brought to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the Commun@@ es who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed the construction activity from case to case , if the applic@@ ant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continues in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of light @-@ com@@ bu@@ sti@@ ble wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , spread to the fires of this species .
in addition to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when people sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the people with information : they used their own civil protection data using f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developers Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of fire bri@@ g@@ ade , and this f@@ ate@@ ful weekend in October was so crucial that the servers did not withstand the rush of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted for more than half a million hits .

in one night in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Tali@@ ban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan had become a land of terror and desp@@ air .
exactly at this time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother did not say so , she knew her son would no longer see her son - maybe even more .
in the morning grey the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

CC @-@ 2.0 - CC @-@ 2.0
Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been mur@@ dered by the Tali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara felt un@@ fail@@ ingly .
the Tali@@ ban known for their hate came ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found herself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a pit pit . the work was hard and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and s@@ lugg@@ ish s@@ acks with mort@@ ars who were he@@ avier than himself to earn his li@@ vel@@ ihood .
at that time as today the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site on which we worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no facilities and no heating there . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows to avoid free@@ zing at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and landed on a small un@@ inhabited island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid in need twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high payout percent@@ ages . it is true , however , that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in the country are disast@@ rous .
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this involves impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially submitted an asylum application - which can go for months after registration of the asylum request .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it also came to A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ restra@@ ined lives helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after having done several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he had opened a second hostel and a fast @-@ fast food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) by the director A@@ min Wah@@ i@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years some of Afgh@@ an companies , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants have emerged .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen personnel are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Ira@@ qi , Turkish and Greek courts .
Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali K@@ han Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the cab@@ u@@ log@@ na pizz@@ eria in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome there are also Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s &apos;s goals , however , extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail trade and go back to the country that he had to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happ@@ ily when I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crops on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af made this trip himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this way .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ti@@ zen report is an international snap@@ shot that shows challenges , vic@@ tories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that stip@@ ulates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after regi@@ stering with a government authority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; users need to be able to use social networks within six months following successful law decision on the authority &apos;s website , indicating its full name and identity number . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever fails this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or a penalty of a penalty .
the law , which has been applied by six@@ ty members of Parliament , is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may another member of Parliament filed a legislative proposal in which he@@ avier pen@@ alties would be introduced for the ins@@ ult of the President or a senior civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law proposal , such a de@@ ed would be pun@@ ished with j@@ ail and money pun@@ ishments , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the law is approved , this can mean up to three years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; det@@ ention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the convi@@ cted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who photograph@@ ed Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstr@@ ating violence against prot@@ esters who demonstrated against the military coup who had led to the dism@@ iss@@ al of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 prot@@ esters who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in prison for a trial date .
recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed on 20 May , because the prison cell , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the def@@ endants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , including weapons of arms , illegal gathering , murder and experim@@ entation .
in another case , a criminal tri@@ bunal in Giza spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indi@@ cted for their reporting to the pro @-@ Mor@@ si session block@@ ade at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Ab@@ dul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunis@@ ian activ@@ ist listened to scann@@ ed documents
in May Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was primarily inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated to a completed action plan . according to the plan , the President of the Republic , which according to the plan explicitly supported a controversi@@ al bill of law , would guarantee business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption inc@@ umbent official am@@ nest@@ y , if they return all un@@ just@@ ly sust@@ aining funds .
the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at thro@@ ws a light on how the prepar@@ atory plans to support the law@@ suit will look like .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia re@@ affir@@ med the nom@@ ination of his sources , indicating the article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code , which re@@ alizes journalists the right to protection of their sources .
however , he entered the district court in Tunis on 09@@ th of May as a witness in the case .
does China want to force the users of social media to present their ID ?
according to the new provisions of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require approval before they write or share messages in social media .
in the Reg@@ ulations , it is also stated that registration with the full re@@ active name will be required .
analysts assume that by this the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments in conversations within the social networks should be achieved . it is un@@ clear until now , how the authorities will apply these rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to en@@ force these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizens &apos; journ@@ alism and independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; can we see ourselves in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
may The state c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the provincial government as an &quot; organizer of dissemin@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this term is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that will organize the publication of information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and to force them on request to negoti@@ ate user data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these websites are currently sites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ classi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the mail service Mail@@ .@@ ru and do@@ zens of other services .
Turkish court features Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to clear two English @-@ language articles , declar@@ ations , Turkey supports ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication has been bann@@ ed , the page was blocked because it became &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information source that co@@ operates with groups to create a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is thus , among other things , China , one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop h@@ itting smoking
after this week , the British government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance compet@@ ences that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Back@@ door Programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications enterprises and intelligence services regarding the proposal but has left other technology companies and the civilian population out@@ war@@ dly .
despite all this , the consultation runs until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwar@@ ded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
