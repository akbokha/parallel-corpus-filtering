<seg id="1">Although I had visited the United States at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnates with the help of Julia Roberts, who wanted to occupy the Supreme Court with judges who were inclined to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free after Method Man," "" "I was as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the United States was only strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very much warmer love letter written about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he walks with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as one says so nicely.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declared his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerer and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him in multitudes.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won with the Republican pre-election was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the Party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotous person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the Journalism Programme, receives people from all over the world, a deep believer with whom I was able to talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "also," "" "Gincinnati Inquirer" "", "the present editor of the" "" "Cincinnati Inquirer" "", "also agreed." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns."</seg>
<seg id="25">The gumps intolerance is also contrasted with the generosity that I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who was fighting the environment for a long time, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still adapts to Kristi Kappes's commitment, which always helped me with lots of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice has helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump pondered his way to nominee presidential candidates, they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly white, presidency a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The debate with the idea that people voted for Trump because they shared either his racism and fanaticism or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">Arranging people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in another way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their congregations are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe. maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks at those who look different to him than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "" "" "Whitelash" "" ": as much as" "" "revolt against all other ethnicities" "" "; wordplay of white in response to whites and whiplash, what the great Van Jones called, has just killed what America did so magnificent." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have, America is welcome everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its President twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history he himself says nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to Hell with diversity, religious freedom and all the concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" "" "asked Mr. Khan." ""</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they called and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received an unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan finished with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "this is now" "" "Trumps" "" "country," "" "said the news." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could no longer find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">"" "the" "" "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" "" "by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC." ""</seg>
<seg id="68">Picture of Flickr user OEA-OAS (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0).</seg>
<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music, which is played in both places, has not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the outskirts of a large garbage dump, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists -but worlds apart from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La banda de música (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and an adult who has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students became a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for their drug abuse and the gangs of gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a casual encounter with a French pilot who launched a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the hustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forestle, timpani, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically on the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguays's capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with restored instruments made of local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chávez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion all made out of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music and music of the Beatles, Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura commemorates the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin made out of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra playing instruments of recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentation called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspirational play from rubbish-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights illegal illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the shared use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was then known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the Iranian waters, before the other coast of Africa visited it.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were thus upset and little inclined to welcome a law criminal of this type at their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comors, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized themselves against the ship. they refused to repel one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries, who simply refused everything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior defendant of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team who discovered and persecuted the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of plundering the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries which had expelled the prime minister from their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like minded and work together. they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trust" Ending Illegal Fishing. "" "</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Through the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing ecosystems can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were formerly obstructed by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the snail-pace, with the information between individual countries, these actions happen in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that one noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea through satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas, such as those who indicate that a ship sends its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were on the go and possibly if they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries which are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports. what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay for penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it is then about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is financially worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, managing director of nfds Africa. the latter is a consulting firm engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD of lost turnover, losing the eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of illegal fishing, which penetrate into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishers, which attracts the region commercial fishing from around the world. among these also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Such practices include activities such as sailing under false flag, counterfeit license papers, specification of imaginative names, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they specifically use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a unbridled control system," "" "says Long." "" "earlier a ship could fish illegal and a country could then say" "" "You must not start my port." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "" "and precisely this legale loophole tries to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has discovered criminal networks that had spread bogus licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and it has persecuted and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Because of its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crimes, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that serves FISH-i to detect suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to detect the illegal ships who like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "" "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO that also deals with fisheries data and provides technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, whereby they can no longer be used by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects various information levels. it should help FISH-i to find criminally acting ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyWisdom has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana marine protection organization: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed anywhere in the world through which the position of each single traceable vessel can be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what where does - it simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here's a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to investigate." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We should do this at a global level. "" Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project where a global system allows the pursuit of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There are indications that FISH-i's activities are not only criminals, but also frighten them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that earlier have been fished without a license and had little to reckon with consequences are now aware that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fisheries set since fishing boats can buy more licenses ever since.</seg>
<seg id="145">Once FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board hauling networks whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars annually disappear from illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">There, six countries have joined forces in 2015, so called West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship running under false flag. and not only the ship was on the road without a license and were used towing nets, which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was still penetrated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time evidence that such a special, collaborative approach to protect the oceans is actually functioning throughout the world sea.

<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is steadily deteriorating, which manifests itself in the daily life of Venezuelans through an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the administration of the current president Nicolás Maduro, but ultimately the posture of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, contributor to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government regulation in their latest article as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, in which inflation and geopolitics are among the highest in the whole world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% at the end of the year) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine, the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new governance alliance.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adaptive version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was released on August 23, 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentinean news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to participate in the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano said, as part of the great La Perla Ribera trial in the province of Córdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, was investigating crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of wearing the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I believed that it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years old one does not realize that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I couldn't realize that my father was a thief, torturer and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriewicz. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father from 1976 to 1978 was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department of 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archive...</seg>
<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor, who is accused of abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and the kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had experienced as a boy, and who said before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows the great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father began to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. I was standing there with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To override, one needs two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to transmit it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - should not be in the source language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate French into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language, which could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees, nevertheless allow translations to be manufactured in-house. then, the Japanese worker, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely distributed - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and mysterious phrases that arise through machine translations are showing that this technique cannot replace human translators for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the weird English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious imprints, which often decorate t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may still be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery, but from big companies or government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet presentations of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcaster took photographs of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by oppositional groups who oppose the government Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and had delegated the tasks of parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of a Tracer out. he pointed out that the connection was capped and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro confirmed later that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two more online transmitters. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly carries out its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to certain domains error-free.</seg>
<seg id="406">When a website is blocked by the DNS, the server replies faulty or refuses the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS selock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the transmission was set on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who carried the protests live in Caracas, was detained.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">He was released eight hours later, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>

<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money passes her underage son or her underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange the child receives food, training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned here is that the children do not have to afford innumerable days of housework, which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of an agreement that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice, referred to as Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance through large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a couple of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She talked to Criaditas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and pranced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated to the cricket guarantees in general still silence.</seg>

<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had given to her, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">But you were fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them, with her hard work.</seg>

<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is assumed, since the draft is no indication of how the Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose registration. unclear is how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="526">A subspecies of the leopard family, which strives through Africa and Asia, belongs to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). in total, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain kind of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows in the video, "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the intestines of the ecosystem also depends on a big predator.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian Leopard actually in the wild bog is low and goes against zero. when the team finds out in the video that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School at Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still the region is occupied with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, which was responsible for North East Japan, documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, tsunami and an Atom disaster in Fukushima triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its seat in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a beautiful prefectures in Japan, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring Prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to disappear, because the tsunami had left whole coastal towns away from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the prefecture of Fukushima experienced a nuclear accident, already for this reason 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from a local point of view, which advances have been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper contains statistics from the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing estate in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed in the Prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">The greatest success among the three prefectures was Miyagi, where 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima provides the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated of temporary shelters (obvious patrons will be transformed, casetsu juutaku) into final substitute houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in temporary shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of Evacuated Kushima Evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful on this occasion. more than 75 percent of the evacuated evacuated after the disaster were resettled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures concerned</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by misfortune, reopened their doors by December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, have raised in the three prefectures of agrarian land in a large area.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed farmland can be used again in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5,400 hectares of land destroyed by Fukushima are located in the "nuclear lock zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains undefeated.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can show only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next great earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to obtain an overall picture, the newspaper led numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated people. she asked her about the state of reconstruction and how her sensation has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents, took measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">"" "" "" "however, 55.9 percent of those surveyed that still hasn't been done enough in terms of catastrophes prevention." ""</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is about those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has increasingly focussed on the situation of the Evacuated People of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness to the worst, disaster-causing nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Nearly 63 000 people in areas outside the prefecture have been displaced from 160 000 people from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were a little more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, converted into permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the 2017 stand still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the Katastrophenols most of the evacuated villages are still in BehelfsHousing hausen, older than 50 years old. they fail to get back in proper homes because the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima will have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects which are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet people from other countries speaking a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often sees that one more links than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at these global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five global Voices members who remember a moment in which they have felt strongly connected to someone about language and country borders.</seg>

<seg id="625">The Forgotten villages of Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba joined the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is widely known as El Central - on Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there are no appreciable sugars on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories have been paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After harvesting, the sugar cane industry in the region stood still, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Around 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commuted daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who rises every day at 4: 00 am, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not robbed his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long inactive period because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls precisely to have heard that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already withstood the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motivating motive for the country some decades ago, but the bad harvests are not new.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry shut off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway steig of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: 155 sugar cane factories were technically deprecated, and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories, which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0,03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 Report "Agricultural perspectives" issued by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will come into history with certainty," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugarcane factories, more than 65 million people, received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, is the word he repeated the most, "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first closing year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">The documents were officially distributed, which differed only on the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister was able to approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was handed over and the letters were getting more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">"" "Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters." "" "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories," "" "he assures." ""</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waits for retirement in another facility, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the decommissioning of the factory, in whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial zone of Cuba and the most important work producer has been extinguished.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do it through hip hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is thus increasing that the young participants discussed topics such as "cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self-acceptance" or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the field of the headquarters of the Kiteskalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the history of Highway 16, also called "Highway of Tears," a street in West Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not elucidated.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters are not always familiar with the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation added, the chorus will be sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received a little help from Gary Jolly from the NorthStar hip hop group, who gave them a drop in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N 'we Jinan the stophe is available in circulation, as well a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost any restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, are located near the entrance to the shokuhin sanitu (see the sculptural models of the dishes) from each dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to making these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the tokiest part of Kappabashi, there are a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes, which the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most of the Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend can now be turned into showy mobile phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">Naver Matome published the Blogger itinii series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanitu.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic tribunals decorated cell tapes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial food items were turned into kitschy collectibles, as in this case, refrigerator magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shogun Cabinet magnets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in the essences is becoming increasingly elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaisen-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was transformed into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the station Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the coming.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phones and mobile-designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with salmon roe?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes may also take a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also travel balls (Onigiri), earrings and wristbands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Additional skurrile plastic dishes can be viewed at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # heretofore match.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry. for example, with the shokuhin sanitu.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "struggle against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the mischiefs and trades regularly appear only in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with pain.</seg>

<seg id="755">Organized crime can not only be feared by our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>

<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered as normal, no matter in which form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with illness and sensing journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass on to newspaper kiosks every day and see the cover pages with images, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from files from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who resists or is sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent to it or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) when he is big. and it's not normal that people listen to songs on the "heroism" of the criminals when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the intimelessness of the people is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town can be justified that they were" "" "ceasing" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to persuade that they remain spared by such tragedies when they are not stirred and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of blackmail in the capital district: how a family has been plundered with threats." it describes how armed criminals pressed money from their business for month, until they had not only destroyed the business, but also torn their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain about it never fails, the trauma will remain, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact you if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kill you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I asked myself whether weeping would dissolve my deepened feelings, but the answer is no, because I have forgotten how to weep. I have to learn to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was killed by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, potatoes broth, tortillas, and "chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the vial with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood had been past two years earlier than just a few blocks from his home, seeing the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Government Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor's office was counted 3103 killings. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Mordes per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in view of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"" "in addition to the project" "" "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" "", "Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed battle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades."

<seg id="818">The Faktencheck is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rumor or exposing a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after something appeared for the first time? content in social media, no matter whether true or untrue, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been misleading to capture tragedies that actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false pairing of picture and event - "false description" or "wrong context" in terminology by Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions to our desire for pictures on news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tank truck crossed the place Sange in the East of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died in the process.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country was neglected for many years and thus devastated. the streets in the region have become dangerous paths full of strokes that were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank truck came to the victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">Officials described a fireball, the dozens of houses covered, including a movie theaters nearby, full of people who watched the football world championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burnt and charmed corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the innocence.</seg>
<seg id="831">"" "a picture with the title" "" "This is Nigeria." "" "from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident train the horrible scenes of this day." ""</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of knotted bodies, which are lined up on the ground while people watch it.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photograph was recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and mistakenly used real but not related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities before which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and corpse lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed behind to count corpses," "" "said a people to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many have been dismissed, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be depicted figuratively.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army point in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerian and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo, when it was mistakenly presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this miserable usage of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has documented assignments for Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a testament to mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Even one step further brings personal comments such as this example falsely the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a blitz message, published by the United Nations described those who could flee to blows, rape and several dead, some through burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported on the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This image originates from an Saudi-Arab news page, which was mistaken in 2012, the president of Myanmar Thein Sein have said, monks and politicians would have participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to photograph this information.</seg>

<seg id="909">This news page mistakenly asserted that the president of Myanmar has admitted Thein Sein (2012) that monks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the pic.</seg>

<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of the Massacre of the Boko Haram 2015 (and more than 9,300 times saved). but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>

<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared only significantly after the original accident of 2010, the picture may ultimately be a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence in connection with the assassinations of Christians through Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the murder of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underestimated compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are tens of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggest this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and smells it the real horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated extensively (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the withholding of images of a refusal is equal to recognise the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images desensitize readers and viewers and take the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which examined how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is some discussion about violent representations in the news media, it is fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually also be used detached from the context or in a completely misused way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, each examination of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e.g. insurmountable) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these conflicable words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish solicesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or an expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from the Mwotslap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- strive for your parents in recognition of how to deal with you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsym language spoken in parts of Brazil such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The convenience or laziness you feel after having been warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They derive other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classify the linguists on this page to publish more of these "insurmountable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1004">They have abused me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not all look the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being a Muslim, in different ways.</seg>

<seg id="1018">But in the Western idea, the religion of Rumi was deleted as well as the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting constitutes a major part of the history of the 1,7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another is in the reductionist images of Muslims who have already colonized Western books for centuries.</seg>

<seg id="1027">This Narrative will fail to acknowledge that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings, and that Saudi Arabian, Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body, which are both sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer-Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This Narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and flawfully that Sikh-men and children become the target of anti-Muslim attacks and harassment.</seg>

<seg id="1035">In the news industry we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) initiative, the number of stories in their original language is a possible response.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices recently reported on a different initiative by Steven Bird, the conflicable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of great cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has conducted events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project apply:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often" "" "is often associated with understanding" "" "these events instead" "" "listening to" "", "to appreciate, to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers first introduce and translate their history in their own language and then explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even though the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their representation lead to the fact that the listeners agree on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call forth laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidator Konate also seizes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for their country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the fables from the rabbit and the Pavian in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>

<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is hosted in Berlin, dedicated itself to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of Book Sprints, a publisher of published books within three to five days, read excerpts from the book of Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and released here is a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction, it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movement is built for free knowledge and what the real costs associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on page to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who have been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for participation in a free culture, many of us have started thinking about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of times of extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer, Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel had taken the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as the insider of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His abode and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in extending access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that established bascule, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototypes was foretold than the work he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations and here merging Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel was not able to know that ten years after working with this work, the IS would put everything in it, that architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">So far, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life with it, dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked him. he has taught other incarnations to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened my door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners, how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a prosling that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambian responded with anger to a corruption case, in which a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence in the state apparatus at which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is about Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants on account of the disproportion of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice Cambaza stood between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his resetting to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the General Prosecutor of the Republic, which evaluates the motion, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza, back to his old post, since the company did not perform disciplining proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not mean the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the decision of the company to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company also has to initiate a disciplinary process against the disproportionate.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company appears to be silent, however, and does not make appropriate legal steps for the application of the respective functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the mosambique social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as" "" "resilient" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence, and half of them had dinner.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently it is obvious: Cambaza would like to pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory! (translated with Google Translate)</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says, the director had no morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I can't believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that has already so massively insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza pleaded not to return morality to serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served itself by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as an inexhaustible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man who has been charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remember that a thief is in jail:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to Samora Machel prison not only to be remembered for ever as the first independent president, but also as sharp, cutting-edge and - incidentally - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was, when he confirmed vigorously that "an ambitious human being is capable of selling also the fatherland for his ambitions to sell his own individual interest."</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although still being discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook acquires the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "evaporama" "" "(in Burmese typeface) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely disappointing connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word in itself does not automatically trigger hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts, in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubts about his use, were censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same letter sequence like 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar PAE' (Spalterbse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooschlager Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was extinguished today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question (la) on Burmesan - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to Facebook's initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech radically nationalists, but also emphasised that Facebook must be analytic before it all deletes all posts that were suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">"" "" "" "the automatism will not understand what you write on factoook." ""</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words side by side.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example" "" "Kalar Htine" "" "(chair) and" "" "Kalar PAE" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to curtail their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who is spreading hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat proved that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new policy of Facebook, I posted a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to sign the Liken, posting and sharing of content for 24 hours, because the post was not corresponded to the Facebook community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of Posts of people who have no negative intentions or who simply attempt to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author gave his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intent to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censing such words will bring only more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "it also seems as if they started this without a local context or technical support and banned such words as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "Erbsencurry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the miserased posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits, which would give them a big turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has caused a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now thinking about Facebook and deliberately write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts which did not contain hate speech but were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text reads" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>

<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to enhance their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heighten the violence in the congregations in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to take control of the outrageous hate speech on his Burmese sites.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than simply zenith the word 'Kalar', it would have been better running, looked more on context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of the marriage law, some members adhered to Hindu and Muslim religious communities in practice, and in May 2016 there was a large public scream. at that time, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, a group leader of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state does not interfere, since that, age does not impress the maturity.

<seg id="1348">In 2011 the Federal Statistical Office of the country confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married from 1997 to 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, who were endeavoring to abolish laws for children's marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring this result.</seg>

<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for example, had no hesitation to say to the critics of the children's marriage, they should, damn to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this uncomplicated matter, and at some point doubts were questioned whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the draft law was decided against the children's marriage - despite 4 senators (among them a woman) of the opposition and an independent one who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>

<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaja announced his intention to take court steps, the law should be adopted, and he seems to redeem his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the General Prosecutor Paris Al rawi, a proponent of the law, said it was quite legitimate when Maharaj refused to act against the law, most social media users wanted to address the issue differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of speaking out of the discussion as general, in a way that we, would invite the state into our bedrooms, would simply specifically talk about that the state, our daughters from it, would be abused, that they may be abused by large, hard-worn men, who are opposed to them, "would you then be prepared to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children are legal or still the norm, even though there are laws which they do.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring web pages, Turkish users can see Wikipedia content again</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia website was published on January 18, 2012, contrasting with the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month Turkey has now opened the popular encyclopedia of Wikipedia, based on crowdsourcing principle.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series are fighting against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many other Internet users are used to use dressing tools for blocked websites (a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third biggest VPN prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles by Wikipedia since 2008, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the most famous country in the world, when it comes to massive censorship from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now multiple mirrors (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the Interplanetary File System), when the platform deposited all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralised peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator hosts), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">Despite legal prohibition, the content is irrevocable.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we've heard the news (about the blockage of Wikipedia), we put everything on putting snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the ability to read the content on a decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to see at least all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is just about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirror site of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors when Wikipedia is locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy-address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL that is not the original. that which you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server sends the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo of Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around. they were blurred with poorly positioned motives and well-balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera with him and try to gratify the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his birthplace right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Neptune's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that would be a leopard on the banks of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was located and I immediately started kneeling pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities to gain global recognition for Neptune and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he ought to know it, for he was already face to face with tigers:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was home because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the King of the Bucket appeared. he immediately sets up, we see us and he stares through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo "I click for more" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Neptune and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent to take photographs of Otters at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women give women that they respect the husband because of social pressure, and the fear of the consequences should they misuse the norm.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a bogus court and violated by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married friend with a name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also not to be called by the name is widespread among men. however, they have far less reprisals to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health personnel, and housewives, entered a unique club and were thus quickly become the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">When one of 56 clubs exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and advocates for the exploitation of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to exposing practices such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and manages this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in their discussion was women, who call their husbands not by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"" "" "" "not saying the name of their husbands, is a custom that they keep all dutily guilty and never questioned." ""</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>

<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who has never mentioned her husband by the name of her husband, wanted to try at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband still weigh for a long time after the video ends.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in the luggage Rohini started its first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>

<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in adrenaline rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their husbands by name.</seg>

<seg id="1522">For the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things about which they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things, for example how our identities are tied to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say some things loudly, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne only saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most people's okay, but some wanted a salist curta to wear a wide shirt over a pants, they didn't trust.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the advantages of own dress code, the morality related to the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own couple of Kurtas (shirts) in a discussion round so that women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will make it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed something, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly into the rolling:</seg>
<seg id="1532">"" "" "" "we have only taken small steps so far." ""</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped talking about the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it, but only if they are alone and are not with any other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two still say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now bear Zinnoberrot at any time on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the particles for more freedom of movement or their own clothing - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">As Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and tell other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald people for organ trading, supposedly for superstitious purposes, troubles the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and a part of the organs had been taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently confessed that the organs of shaman are being used in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth, declared the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald-headed men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the aim of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led the UN to carry out a mission in the South African country in order to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight this superstition and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore. Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore was supposed to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the Chamber of Lawyers of the State of New York, the Minister remarked that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "rotate logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and dedication to create this precious land, we hear that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', but in the face of this, he seemed invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">He has, on the other hand, defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently run by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core of the subject, the good old lyre comes up from the authoritarian powers that pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, because it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmugam we were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Related questions he clothed with non-responses of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asks Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our valued K Shanmugam would take the effort to enlighten this point if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he pointed out the criticisms that you should start reading the whole co-ordinance of the conference to better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the caption.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore were so uneven important, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said Singapore" "" "Be not a country," "" "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of an adolescent generation, making such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what awaits me - whether I agree with them or not, but that is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is really associated and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review sets the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "Mr Shanmugam has committed a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudger spokesman?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1721">If not, in which country do the sovereign rights of the city come back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet, Mr Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore afford their military service, do they defend only their city but not their country?</seg>

<seg id="1805">Now over 20 years have passed since the Georgian-abchashic war has been officially ended, but its scars are still visible in this part of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern districts in Tkuarchal show striking pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya shakhta, Polyana and Kharihava are in the coalpool of Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Different ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, depreciation, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, the largest part of the Russians and the chases live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements became also known in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these clerical cities.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the population of the population was 16,000 people, having barely risen over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants passing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink spectacle frame and gold-coloured ear rings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about €2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>

<seg id="1909">Where are You Mum Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on cartons outside.</seg>

<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and Africans often travel together the route and that Africans already speak to Whatsapp of Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a building worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup Football World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>

<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells us that her guests often send her text messages when they went away to greet her or tell her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She declares that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus ticket to numerous African migrants is sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered to them his house for a dollar spent the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a kitchen outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>

<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single educator, offered him a roof.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users will be attracting their own.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the phone users in Tianshan district of Urumqi received a mobile notification in which it assigns the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the Communication, it is said that the app" "" "prevent access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"" "" "" "however, the authorities also used the app to use the app for more than fighting terrorism." ""</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had replaced messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app was able to identify and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is the blockage of pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" might enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">"" "" "" "this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region." ""</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reports of digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often darker for those living in distant, oppressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit discomfort and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censor and surveillance measures as well as routine internet depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Based on Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China," published news in China, the censored messages published in China showed photos from a checkpoint where policemen crew indiscriminately checked whether they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people will install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you're detained at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They forced the people to use devices designed for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the recovery technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Mao China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (branded bÃ ¶ dens) also released a Jingwang product description, which suggests that the software can lift the passwords requirement of a Windows operating system and therefore unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang computers and mobile phones are used in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The prescriptions in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the city party council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government agencies, authorities and associated institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obligated to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs, until August 1, their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media storage cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously any "terrorist videos" to be identified and destroyed. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he locks to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, sometimes to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine defiled lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaib's family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felahyees (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned her well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with issues like oriental, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his thinking, and he can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he doesn't open it openly, he won a special inclination against the American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have something to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation" - he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think about my own life circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I'm a man," "" "while he dissolved in water Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee in a scorching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the pressures run lukewarm coffee and the swaths of the Kent cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"" "" "" "sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially if one throws a look into neighbouring countries." ""</seg>
<seg id="2109">Hence, it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in the public during Ramadan water, in order not to land in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan said a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-singer Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional standards of the country and the main reason for the concert charts.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former press spokesmen of the Islamic Coalition, Dima Tahboub, said in an interview with CNN that the concert "just" was canceled because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which indemnifies the ancient legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as" "" "progressive supporters of human rights" "", "which continues to be chosen" "" "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be simply seizing rhetoric, but actually reflects an increasingly clear-crystallising reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib moved traditional gender standards to glue by depicting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex-helike sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a well-known unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"" "in recent years, the number of" "" "honours of honour" "" "has increased in Jordan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary murders in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still more aggravating that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support women who have attempted murder or domestic violence to provide adequate ways.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to danger of intra-family violence must "be kept in jail for a certain period of time," and for their release often a long-term bureaucratic expenditures and the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary that the woman will have nothing to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaib's music also enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from subjects that are long as tabu in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib argued that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit calls on sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was judged by politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib takes the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "ghareeb" "" "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically political can be carried on.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one can get in his words, "that can get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of LGBTQ + individuals and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals have been extensively censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordan online program Roya, to later notice that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a modified version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals is not bound to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuh, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks itself: if Abu Nuis, who later should work on behalf of the caliph, openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou's Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service established several former members of the government and members of the teacher's association, arguing that they had criticised the problems that were deeply rooted in social media comments on the problems that were deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is continuous giving and taking. Jordan has driven Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that is what Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he not only dreamed of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" "" "experience it" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a real and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not through bombs, scatter symbols and artificial kind of democracies. at least, he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">As far as it is, Hdaib will continue to overlap and therefore also resist resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which belongs to the Aman as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warribs are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that there is a variant of Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the party, the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years have been handed down and come from a time in which armies from the west marched into the north-east to force the indigenous people of the region, the emishi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">It is hard to imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community center in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two carriages are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a stunning way to spend the summer:</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rare, outer appearance and body care were as important as in this history, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate occupation like the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima's capital - a region with a very high crime rate where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population in this region could not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to the fact that more and more normal people go into the experienced hands of hairdressers that can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts compete against each other in order to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions like the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hairdressing tools and to obtain training in the hairdressing art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered have seen dozens of young people that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because we have built this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution "Love message to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important, people who feel expelled, accommodating?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is exactly the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign of Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters of guerrilla warriors.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently their country was the venue of a historic event, and they wanted to contribute to this: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla movement (German: revolutionary armed forces Colombia), which constitutes the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the treaty of peace was considered so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before the Colombians there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and carried their arms around the clock, must now integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla warfare, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian people would have to join together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: so far, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as Inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation arose on the world summit of Nobel Peace Prize winners, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those forgotten that they need much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former warriors of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and have to build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war on a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono Cauca region on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipal administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogotart Foundation, travelled to the camp to transfer the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC did so as they had done before to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it's unbelievable how many different feelings one can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies between," the policy scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila told later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we passed the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I looked into one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed lay a MGL-Granatwerfer, a deadly weapon in Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said," "" "Hello, what do they do?" "" "he said," "" "I answer a letter that someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone wrote me something so beautiful, that's why I answer it. "I suddenly answered the tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him all the way and set me next to the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war too, was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society there that waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">So far I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the FARC leaders explained the history of the organisation, their ideals, and gave insights into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice from the state to the whole Colombian people has worked out. now, where we have the opportunity to develop a political party, we can help shape society more fairly.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing those people who had never heard heard yet and had no right to vote, and to see that the people I often saw as monsters and even hate people with beautiful emotions that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and can give a smile and hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the town of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Columbians have been prophesied that peace would rule after the disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to take up arms, lift themselves up and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we at FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology, they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will be faced with many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2283">They asked me to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They created absurd demands: some said to me, I have to prove it by running at the top without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grosny and say that I hadn't changed my sex that everything was just bad speech and Photoshop.</seg>

<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>

<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about the gender equality, that is a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I still carry in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this mental barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>

<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told no people were arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this, I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced by blood satisfaction.</seg>

<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend told me there would be not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives in order to stand up Kadyrow's judgment.</seg>

<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>

<seg id="2342">But until now they were not presented as bandits, there have been no reports on this yet. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>

<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and abductions of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think, already before 2003 I was already well-known as I lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems.</seg>

<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>

<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about morals on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had smiled and laughed before, looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the Republic was steadily deteriorating.</seg>

<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi Monarchy took power and in 1925 undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields coming in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>

<seg id="2423">Doha said that especially unemployment has become worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and anti-Arab discrimination in the adjustment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions do not prefer to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livelihood outside their home of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their name and surname to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and so be employed as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone speak Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes.</seg>

<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women face a glass ceiling sooner or later, and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer double and triple below.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black women women, on black women in LGBTIQ community or black women from the Diaspora; if I mention the way we have always been misused, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists have been silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">"" "but are all agreed that women - all women - should come together to" "" "lift their voices up and" "" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "", "to achieve equality (some) of women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualized violence there is an institutionalized form of racist motivated violence, which we are exposed to black women in a double way.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and types of origin deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls are often referred to school with a migration background as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering from domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want that all women, all men and all men, have the same rights to all men and all men. on the other hand, I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account injustices in their thinking that relates both to the sex and the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women repeatedly and again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "1851 in their speech:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to sustain an ideology in which the black woman in a historical sense is a menaced and marginalised being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groupings, which, moreover, through cultural appropriation absorbs our customs and customs to advance their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to tell white women the importance of the overlap of skin color and sex. for some of them continue to keep silent the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them for better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and limit themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself fully and completely from feminism and to join the movement of the orphanage, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of being campaigning for a white feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we have black women to define ourselves according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: Reclaiming's: how we can defend ourselves by defining us on our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, emotional, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which constitute the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement by which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, as in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is hard to find out how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues in the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay. "there are different information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the available numbers are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 people participated in domestic violence during the District State Attorney Office. 70% of them went to violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in the courts of peace. also here 86% of the ads of women came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the adverts, 40% of women said that they were physically maltreated, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics do not show the true magnitude of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan women's ministress Ana Baiardi only few of these crimes are actually displayed. "to any woman who is repaid in Paraguay because of mental mistreation, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "on any woman that is refunded because of physical abuse, two women who do not do this," "" "said at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">"" "" "" "since women's murder in Paraguay is not an own criminal act, law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners." ""</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016, journalists included at least 12 cases of genocide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The co-ordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do it, but after that she should be regretted.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but two years later she carried out psychic violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read it earlier, I always thought that this only happens to women who are too subservient because they are fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorical if he had ever lifted the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had enjoyed this so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain blame.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner maltreated her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Network Yo te creo ("I believe you") made up of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorian case everything started with mental abuse.</seg>

<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a draft bill was debated in the Paraguayan Parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorElla (# fürst).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos movement (# non-donor) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law stipulates that Femcid is to be declared an independent criminal act and harsher harder to punish as it is the case already in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>

<seg id="2533">The original bill of legislation had foreseen the bulk of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs which must bear the victims of violence at the present time, if they just want to reimburse an indication and wish to receive secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for this:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, maltreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethinking has to take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">He who is silent in view of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the perpetrators of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to reimburse as long as maltreatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been changed, among other things, a passage that led the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, Figure takes place with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely or even mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons why medical research is carried out on-site: for a lack of healthcare, many medicines and vaccines are missing, covering the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more severe consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for researching these diseases by pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research that is carried out by African scientists is helping to build own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Center for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, just as the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the sambastic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (AGM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the sampler national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostics testing for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">What do you think about the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">That must change, otherwise we will always remain receivers instead of being makers themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">AGM: where does funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">How is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">How is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">How big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research on space, health care (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from this.</seg>
<seg id="2624">How can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only accessible for payment (the so-called Paywall), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine that covers solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredaka, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Morton's work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many lettuals he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he couldn't use it for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents do not only contain for individual varieties, but also for specific properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or ruffled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been registered for more and more plants such as grain or cartridges. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security around the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton is still breeding a salad, but he now needs longer, since his work continues to be more and more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if in a river there is a boulder to which I must dull." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when they stand trial, no one can breed any new kind of salad, because all the features are already patented. "it is therefore as good as possible and tries to breed those traits that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and strives to not use any material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">"" "he also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the US and anywhere in the world: open Source Breeding (" "" "Open Source" "" "breeders)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red roasting salat of variety outlet in the "glasshouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (Initiative für "Open Source" seed) is inspired by the free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called into existence to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called OSSI, US breeders are able to agree that others can freely use the seed-bred seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they cannot continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others to breed their seeds in order to breed their own varieties, and do not immediately sow - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects for the future</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the ability to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds are therefore playing a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultivating seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables, grains, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed industry," says he and takes on the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry, whose recent example is to buy, for example, on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetable is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "" "" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative commit themselves to keep their seed freely available to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered because the available gene pool is shrinking because of the increasingly widespread intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus more and more limited.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of the OSSI, was engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all cartridge characteristics is protected as intellectual property, making it usable for plant breeders either at all or just terribly.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are not such estimates, but experts like Luby assume that mass-built plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from such ones, through which their taste or colour improves up to those due to which they flourish in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders takes more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changing conditions by climate change are much worse predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts the belief that intellectual property should encourage other breeders, as" "" "patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection does not inhibit innovations, but promotes it by providing the public with more material and expertise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this other: 20 years of waiting until a patent expires, certainly not promoting innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the battle already.</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "but the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain:" "" "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it is made impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "altogether Morton interfered with the concept of patented plant characteristics:" "" "we do not really create the characteristics themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders, we ultimately have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who breeds a variety also breeds its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, are required for their cultivation of mass herbicides, breeding in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that are moving across international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto) patents, they create the majority of smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the experiment, or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his kennel.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than corporations that patented.</seg>

<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which itself describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a "open source" seed program. the centre with farmers is working together and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation Agrecol is working on an open-source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the OSSI obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeders differ from country to country, therefore the OSSI obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, one explanation is not a law; now it is at the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, Hivos established a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' Program for Open Source seed systems, declares that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open source seed systems, for which the official starting signal will be scheduled next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - publishes a report from aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report. it represents the opinion that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed, exchanging and improving seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context from the Luby of OSSI hopes that more people will soon recognize him.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human Rights Organization and Blog are the latest Censorship goals in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock up content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of August 5, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), documenting human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on the same.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "August has published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities criticised this step and promised to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains in spite of this attack and the ridicule of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world. although it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as now. ANHRI affirms that all technical possibilities are exploited to overcome the blockage and not to give up. we insist on fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 web pages more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-based Al Jazeera network for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of the wave of web side locks to the victim. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles that he does not write accessable websites and media for Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the apparatus of the Egyptian government itself, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the publisher in which Ziadas blog is given a home, on the other hand is more accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the blocking by the government and reflected what this means to him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old but has in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of the blogs may not be significant for the world, so it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been able to give me the feeling of a siege, an arrest, an attempt of murder, unloading at the national Security Council, blocking blogs and any other website I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I didn't write nothing for nothing. in other words, my words have an influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after having locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave walk the way through to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), the Egyptian authorities blocked pages from 24th May to 06th August 133 websites. this gave technical tests to the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of providers by circumventing Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites which VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content that Egypt users could have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is also worsened by the fact that the vote decisions are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which it can proceed against these acts.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army was deployed in the favelas in Niterói, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Foto von: estado Maior (CML) via fotos públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day by day newspapers throughout Brazil report with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of many postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14 year old in school was shot," "" "every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is assassinated," "" "thieves rob pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Timer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and Air Force to Rio." ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">"" "" "" "in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the terrible wave of violence reached the highest level in 2017 for 10 years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called on the UN to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports such as these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published on 16 August the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "", "in which she announced a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the paper as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that occur in every metropolis on the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crime, etc. everything that happens however from the civilised standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the heading "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">"" "" "" "this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cruelty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war of war in a country that does not recognize war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war dissident, when he is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, who only shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">"" "explores the term" "" "war" "" "more than it benefits?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira argues against the violence as a "war." this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it more difficult to account for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and self-complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as Cecília points out, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), one of the police unit established by the Federal State of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to capture a Favela by using a massive police body and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. for some years, the UPP lasted several years after several reports on shikes and repressions against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit, increasingly under attack.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited from one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not meet the criteria laid down by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the gradation of the situation in Rio as a war also draws to serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war. this includes entering into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civil war is an incomprehensible point in the landscape and becomes the object for "collateral damage" and "wandering spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War hin or her, fact is that the residents of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police force the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a fruit seller died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the ensuing civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly through the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victory Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, are currently located in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib currently around a million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Eastern Ghouta region, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre of Assad's regime was perpetrated on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, the rebels controlled by rebels have been under siege, which led people to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Due to the longlasting blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unreachable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a counterpart, a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and perform the project together with the NGO al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods in Syria and are only very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their nutritional value makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Directly of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many district capitals in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were grassioned in the week before in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government proclaimed a statehood last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of light-combustible wood, like in a vicious circle, spread to the fires of this species.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16, when people sought information or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the people with information: they used their own civil protection data using fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developers João Pina to simplify the work of fire brigade, and this fateful weekend in October was so crucial that the servers did not withstand the rush of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted for more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2875">Exactly at this time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner together.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother did not say so, she knew her son would no longer see her son - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning grey the boy should break up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e Wahdat, dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara felt unfailingly.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban known for their hate came ever closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after his escape, Asharaf found herself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a pit pit. the work was hard and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and sluggish sacks with mortars who were heavier than himself to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time as today the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really hard," "" "Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site on which we worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no facilities and no heating there. we hung nylon in front of the open windows to avoid freezing at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered shipwreck and landed on a small uninhabited island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharaf homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid in need twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high payout percentages. it is true, however, that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the large majority of asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "this involves improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially submitted an asylum application - which can go for months after registration of the asylum request.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it also came to Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unrestrained lives helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having done several years of work in the construction industry, Asharaf put his entire savings in the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he had opened a second hostel and a fast-fast food.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, approximately 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>

<seg id="2915">In recent years some of Afghan companies, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants have emerged.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen personnel are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the cabulogna pizzeria in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome there are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Asharafs's goals, however, extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail trade and go back to the country that he had to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where a risk is, there are also possibilities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>

<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but at the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearing of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, which protested against the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that stipulates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">"" "" "" "users need to be able to use social networks within six months following successful law decision on the authority's website, indicating its full name and identity number." ""</seg>
<seg id="2934">Whoever fails this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or a penalty of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which has been applied by sixty members of Parliament, is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "may another member of Parliament filed a legislative proposal in which heavier penalties would be introduced for the insult of the President or a senior civil servant." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law proposal, such a deed would be punished with jail and money punishments, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "" "" "if the law is approved, this can mean up to three years" "" "detention" "" "for the convicted." ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "moreover, this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who photographed Egyptian policemen while demonstrating violence against protesters who demonstrated against the military coup who had led to the dismissal of the elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, as more than 700 protesters who had been arrested at the same incident, four years in prison for a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed on 20 May, because the prison cell, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan is threatening the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, including weapons of arms, illegal gathering, murder and experimentation.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal tribunal in Giza spoke the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-barbary. they were indicted for their reporting to the pro-Morsi session blockade at Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested at the previously mentioned incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activist listened to scanned documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, which is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was primarily interrogated to a completed action plan. according to the plan, the President of the Republic, which according to the plan explicitly supported a controversial bill of law, would guarantee businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption incumbent official amnesty, if they return all unjustly sustaining funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on 21 April on the website of Nawaat throws a light on how the preparatory plans to support the lawsuit will look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia reaffirmed the nomination of his sources, indicating the article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which realizes journalists the right to protection of their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">However, he entered the district court in Tunis on 09th of May as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their ID?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new provisions of the Information Bureau of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require approval before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the Regulations, it is also stated that registration with the full reactive name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that by this the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within the social networks should be achieved. it is unclear until now, how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"" "" "" "Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizens' journalism and independence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2957">"" "can we see ourselves in" "" "WeChat" "" "?" ""</seg>

<seg id="2960">According to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register with the provincial government as an "organizer of dissemination."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"" "this term is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that will organize the publication of information."
