this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before someone heard Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA has illeg@@ ally heard teleph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. intelligence operation , in which the CIA had literally dra@@ fted dra@@ fts for a nuclear bom@@ b .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not work at all ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has determined against R@@ isen and called upon him to name his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condem@@ n wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to sp@@ ill up journalists .
according to the First constitutional review , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right when media does not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the bra@@ ve that they are reve@@ aling .
so when the government arrived at R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ ageous re@@ por@@ ters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was living with the risk of going to prison .
but then , only days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they said for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped on the rise .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , re@@ por@@ ters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of fail@@ ing and getting rid of R@@ isen , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , his teleph@@ ones are secre@@ tly worried ,
just like his email data , financial and banking information , his credit card , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condem@@ n Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and Ris@@ ing .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers in his attempt to protect wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned him more than all US governments .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has too much of their work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional review because the government has more and more possibilities to sp@@ y out all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as technology is allowed to b@@ ypass the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can use technologies to better protect its sources .
and they can do it from the moment they contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that has not yet been known as R@@ isen &apos;s book written , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls .
such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transmission system for wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the Internet of Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now further developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post Office .
there you can upload documents or send information , just like in any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the relevant news agency has access .
so the government can no longer obtain information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the out@@ set .
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pi@@ on@@ age technologies that thre@@ aten us all .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technologies like Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to report mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer ,
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report about over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental colleague , the alarm goes for contamin@@ ated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a wall street insi@@ ders who warned us ahead of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness to have a statement . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were sent from news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the Panam@@ anian law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to firms like Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has re@@ signed .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad has offices in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous for the next release , and the next revealed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agent r@@ ill@@ ers or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems cr@@ ying away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and do not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these re@@ vel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few of them to hide and conce@@ al their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and reve@@ aling for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine a mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these buildings .
it can be very difficult for criminal prosec@@ ution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters .
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the United States .
presum@@ ably , because there were so far no prominent Americans who arrived in these re@@ vel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a data dock of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information , need less information to establish a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to take off school@@ children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to zoom especially sus@@ cep@@ tible to investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister , who wanted to bring the suspic@@ ious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked it , that all except one of our investig@@ ators made suggestions on how to transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it is not about a single top polit@@ ician , wrapped in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
we need to change the rules to comp@@ licate this kind of behavior .
that may sound very dro@@ w@@ ning as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see that some things have begun to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few years we have seen more transparency concerning the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU ac@@ qui@@ res central regi@@ sters at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US lag@@ s behind here .
representatives of both parties have submitted a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama re@@ vel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this type of in@@ transparency through laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency which enables this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story I almost escaped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Mazda remained and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip throughout the country . afterwards he would go to peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep ton@@ ight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he said he would go to a peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed on the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I get into my mind ?
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is mad ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I stepped out of bed , sitting on toe tips to the door , and my bedroom door shut down .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the art work he had bought from me is now hanging in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my point of view completely .
perhaps the people who were sold as a stranger to me in childhood , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a time leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my room@@ mate moves out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to turn fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on hard@@ wood floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I am sure our cheese @-@ ham O@@ mel@@ ette tast@@ ed completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ved .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay for our rent ?
things came to the roll .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept .
thus we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website that people post public images from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors one closes when visiting .
over the Internet , they can invite wild people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited that the ro@@ cket would ign@@ ite .
but they are not .
nobody , who is still at Tro@@ st , would invest in a shop that allows stran@@ gers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all have learned that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
when one has a problem , one contempl@@ ates on the things that one can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Art , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the total experience .
we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we asp@@ ire .
it is a 30 seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked cellular phone to your left seat .
this quiet flight of pan@@ ic you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
for the only thing that &apos;s more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read their SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked cell of a stranger in his hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
so also most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just so , who actually has Al Go@@ res mobile ?
could you please tell us that he is chann@@ eling the president &apos;s office ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail at this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor would first have imag@@ ined with his name ; if he had told wh@@ ence he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 convi@@ ctions , all say : &quot; he can really capture very well @-@ locked hands ! &quot;
how would you feel if you &apos;d have to leave your mobile ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system rein@@ forces confidence .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their jud@@ gements before we presented them online .
last week we found something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are about age and place of residence .
little surprising we trust people most who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by jud@@ gments .
if one has less than three app@@ rais@@ als , nothing changes .
but if one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation develops simil@@ arities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted predi@@ le@@ ctions .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much one is reve@@ aling .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your apartment ! I make holidays with my family holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help us overcome our prejudi@@ ces against stran@@ gers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need not covered before .
the business is very good for us .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who un@@ allowed parties to celebrate or devast@@ ate apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stay in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front , when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that one h@@ ears in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem .
for people are ri@@ ghtly bound to each other .
when confidence works , wonderful things can arise .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even jump@@ ed blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his judgement :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to tend to heart attacks due to se@@ dent@@ ary activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t know them properly .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books over .
you can stay even longer without calcul@@ ating extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay will exp@@ ire .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
when I stum@@ bled on this concept for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing work together with money transactions ?
it is here an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is now just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay a part open and that changes everything .
when travelling today , it is possible to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic for this .
what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if in any place that one visits , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show a quarter of which one has never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would create apartments of reason for sharing ?
what would this look like ?
what if cities would accept the thought of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that enable us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul this project has already begun . many parking places owned by the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a stay ,
were taught to people whose children were depri@@ ved of them . inc@@ ub@@ ator programs were launched ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in Share Economy . overnight 785 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host today .
so the idea seems not to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality has existed before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this aston@@ ishing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Mazda runs past me .
of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for the future .
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is actually true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it is great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I decided to ou@@ ten .
no , not as hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my hat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , compared to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and in@@ accessible beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , question@@ ed , question@@ ed and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devot@@ ion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k sometimes brings me to we@@ eping .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone you perceive you fully understands , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian American Dream . &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , aircraft fle@@ w into buildings , people jump@@ ed out of the buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock quickly turned into indi@@ gn@@ ation .
why should one do such a thing ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... Muslim terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the acts of others turned me from a citizen into a susp@@ ect .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and start post@@ graduate studies .
I remember , as we drove in silence -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time fear@@ ing to be recognized as Muslims .
we went to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t melt yourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings were loud : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims , or from people whom they thought for Muslims to go outside and beat .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought , we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have defeated the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to have to explain itself constantly .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today , we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they talk about my church like a tumor in the US body .
only the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour can be seen only under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , not a tumor in the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , educ@@ ators and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America more secure ?
it might hold a few parking spaces , but don &apos;t stop the terror .
regular visit to a mos@@ que leads to more tolerance to people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater citi@@ zenship .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
in the radic@@ alisation process , one has found that it starts online . as a first , the person is cut off from their community , even by their family , so that the extre@@ mes group can make a brain washing which causes the person to be the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ itor or belief .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop the people going to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS grounds its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a person , I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination if they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if one thro@@ ws a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the Scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding I@@ mam recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pret@@ ended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken brought them to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of in@@ justice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that had given her anger , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization through extrem@@ ists who promised a solution .
this I@@ mam established the connection with God and their church .
instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways for real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que , she kept it from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affects our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ it@@ arian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ces .
a study shows : when one puts news reports in which negative about Muslims were reported , they agreed rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look , when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up of the Iraq war and during two elec@@ toral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for manip@@ ulating the public to cav@@ eat the foundation of a free society that has rational and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear cu@@ res us all .
in the assignment of collective deb@@ ts , it is not just about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ s@@ man .
he was talented , talented , much promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her cur@@ riculum vit@@ ae . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did I become such a young man of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she mur@@ dered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had come to visit in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as in a execution , after having posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism cannot only be imm@@ oral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can prac@@ tise our religion freely .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the chair of the child , we drove silence , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , and went out my shoes , and went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the I@@ mam made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the gathering were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had taken courage and compassion and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
will you be sure to be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might claim that you hold a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a think@@ er with drau@@ ght , work in a sensitive think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t decei@@ ve you . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims all over the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when humans appear as a rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a milli@@ ard business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones .
before air par@@ c@@ els entered into our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of aircraft in the F@@ RAC Centre in France built a six @-@ metre tall tower of 1,@@ 500 bricks . some years ago they started flying with rop@@ es .
by connecting , flying units reach high speed and acceleration in confin@@ ed spaces .
you can also build self @-@ resi@@ li@@ ent structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ences and in general react to laws of nature .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to transc@@ end the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight .
in order to make a system autonomous , it must collec@@ tively know where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level , for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; landing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called tail @-@ starter ,
an aircraft that tries to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and thus has great advantages with start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of tail@@ gates is that they react sensiti@@ vely to turbul@@ ences such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn &apos;t matter in what position the optimum position can be recovered and the power can be improved by practicing .
Originaltitel : des@@ perate House@@ wives ( TV )
during our research , we often face basic abstract questions that come to the heart of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that gather together to hurt you .
decades ago trained pil@@ ots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which had only two mo@@ vable parts : a propeller and a tail @-@ ru@@ der .
recently we discovered that flies with only one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote aircraft . it was invented recently .
it only has a mo@@ vable part , a propeller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and cross@@ bars , no other actuators or control surfaces , only one propeller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move around in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the sophisticated algorith@@ m of the tail@@ gate . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it right when I all watch is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was fil@@ med last night .
when the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in suffici@@ ency , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
by doing so , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
move in the room in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers from the eight Prop@@ ellers .
some are available in models , the rest is learned directly from flying .
let &apos;s see it .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate propeller aircraft .
this turns in clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other against clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when one builds them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance system .
if something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller is eliminated , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further even if limited .
we will now demonstrate this by making hal@@ f@@ way air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commerci@@ ally available micro @-@ Quad@@ copter -- each one weigh@@ s less than one sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine out there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the impact of this technology .
for types like us , the reward lies in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economical potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
1.3 billion years ago cir@@ cl@@ ed two black holes to each other in a very far distant galax@@ y , so the mass of three stars transformed into pure energy in a ten @-@ second second .
for this brief moment they lit more brigh@@ ter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the Universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time frame itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events in time .
1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth .
since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God stands for -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group decided to build a particularly bra@@ ver -- R@@ ai White of MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronal@@ d Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them beha@@ ved crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ er- gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of lig@@ o was considerably increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final trial to clarify some minor , stub@@ born issues .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the det@@ ecting of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ro@@ wed through the earth through the earth .
they went through you and me
and through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ are@@ well of my death @-@ sick father .
basically , that was the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist on MIT . he has been studying grav@@ itation waves from black holes for 23 years and their observ@@ atories such as lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a rip@@ pling in the fabric of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and put into the other .
for illustration , lec@@ turers in courses lead to rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often a really al@@ ber@@ ized dance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and pun@@ ished by us at the meeting of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the com@@ ma , followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the lig@@ o @-@ employee for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured exactly at less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about grav@@ itation
Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder , Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties during construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ ci@@ sts are inv@@ enti@@ ve and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
THOR@@ NE published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims that Lig@@ o is more than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite convenient , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by percei@@ ving the light coming out of several points around you .
with sounds it is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 metres .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
about the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , just Alice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; du@@ mmer Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot create simple images of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the All literally .
the gravity to listen , can reveal to us a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , whereby my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circles simple : w@@ up@@ p !
the two bodies rot@@ ate very quickly , you hear the same cir@@ cle@@ ment with an additional key change . this sounds like the wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render &#93; somebody who knows what to hear , recognize this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold sun @-@ mass , which rot@@ ate approximately as fast as the st@@ acks of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : let us briefly consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , revol@@ ve one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves an entirely new way to investigate the universe , as it was never possible before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space can we not see -- practical or basically -- not visible .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . we learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucle@@ us hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see as this is opaque .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Ur@@ b@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the old , but we will never see it , since the urine is covered by its own night@@ light .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and most importantly , I am optim@@ istic that there exist in all things we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things we just discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt we had@@ n &apos;t expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this topic : me : the species of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o they are watching , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the din@@ osau@@ r bones for our archaeological work , so to speak .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on what happened in the universe , the gen@@ esis of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as bra@@ ve as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Ur@@ b@@ all itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say to everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , I feared , removed my fear .
my fear to keep spe@@ eches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a definite yes , which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected sort . it began with a question of my youngest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on , I always swear to play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I am doing , or where to go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very trying .
it has a magic effect on me , on my children , on our family .
but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : just recently I fully understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; sag@@ as for playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am an author . I think things out , aw@@ aken you to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
ich kre@@ ire Fernsehen . ich produ@@ ci@@ ere Fernsehen .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV @-@ season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each programme offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days with four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars TV , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts that are simultaneously in production four , 16 ep@@ iso@@ des : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 ep@@ iso@@ des : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series run after each other on Thursday evening .
all over the world my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are shows which I have created myself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ end@@ lessly . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire burning around the world .
do you know who is doing this ?
nobody , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard whether you &apos;re a company , a country or a classroom , take a business or a budget , take me seriously when I talk about work so you can understand that I &apos;m not just about the computer and fant@@ asi@@ es , and it &apos;s true when I say : I don &apos;t understand that it &apos;s not a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is as I set troops on , as I painted on a canvas .
just as if you were dre@@ aming of a high tone , ran a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cru@@ el and reasonable . and the best part is the sums .
there is such a change in me when working well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz h@@ ears like a busy street , I could go for ever on it .
many people assume when I declare to them the sums , that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing makes me pleasure .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does them .
but the sum -- when I started working and working with television as I began to work and work , create , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy .
the sum is more than writing .
the Sum@@ men is action and activity . the Sum@@ men is a drug .
the sum is music . the sum is light and air .
the sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz then you can no longer strive for size .
the feeling not to be different than striving for size , no matter what price .
this is called the sums .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called gen@@ ius .
perhaps it is the ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sum .
I just want to tell you , I am a titanium , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it .
in order to make a clear : the more successful I become , the more ep@@ iso@@ des , the more sp@@ read@@ ings , the more work there is , the more work , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , not true ?
the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz .
I like this su@@ mming . I love the sum .
I need the sum . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this sum ?
and then the sums stopped .
revised , over@@ stressed , exagger@@ ated , burnt out .
the sum stopped .
now my three daughters are ac@@ custom@@ ed to the truth that their mo@@ m is a single stit@@ ch .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ b , I want to go to Sh@@ onda land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ anen .
they are baby tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums were heard .
the sum of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my job anymore . the engine was off .
the sum did not come back .
my su@@ mming was broken .
I did the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , does not give up , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no su@@ sten@@ ance .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a Pre @-@ Show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I simply had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the sum I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love suddenly f@@ ades ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today , stup@@ id author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do it , you &apos;re working to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a mother , a painter , Bill G@@ ates , you just love another and that gives one the summ@@ ons when you know the sums , and know how the bu@@ zz feels when the sum stops , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart ce@@ ases , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no more than two things become aware of me :
first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; cookies . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t call anyone anymore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is this happening ?
I hate it when I &apos;m Titan and bolt my bu@@ zz , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the su@@ mming , I cannot do anything except to un@@ fit .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country , which I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are stick@@ y fingers and dam@@ p kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it &apos;s going to release , or whatever the girl gets into &quot; Die Eis@@ könig@@ in . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something inside me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the sums are slowly coming back .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel as if I knew a magical mystery .
but let us remain with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the working environment , the titanium sum@@ men , this is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself with the aid of broad@@ casts and tel@@ ev@@ isions and how functional my brain is , then I for@@ got what the real sum is .
the sum is no force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on the love .
the sum is the current that comes from lust .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
real bu@@ zz igno@@ res the pressure of history , the tasks to be imposed , the expect@@ ation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ per@@ ed the false words to me , for what God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can rid myself of any gu@@ ilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice unless I want to hear the sums again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not lying to me as you work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am better at work than at home . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this conf@@ ession is painful , because what a person is better to work than to be home ?
well yes , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
we sh@@ ave around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bub@@ bles .
in doing so , I feel mainly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe fulfilled me .
I play and play until I wonder : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you keep me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
there you probably have quite , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you also know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et Show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or cookie replaces me .
and speak my teen@@ y daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more does not require it .
everyone can get 15 minutes a bit , even at a bad mood !
15 minutes a piece !
no cell@@ phone , no clothes , no distr@@ action .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to do .
but 15 minutes are in !
my children are my well@@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the sums of having a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find it out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I will see . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more .
15 minutes a bit , why not treat yourself at full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sum seems to return if I do not work .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz , the sum is not me ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and stick@@ y fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my bu@@ zz .
the summ@@ ons of life .
the sum of love .
the summ@@ ons of work is part of me , but just one part . and I am so grateful for that .
it is my breath that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country , which I create , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the projection screens , the sum , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the other , the right sum : the tot@@ als of life .
the more I feel this su@@ mming , the more this unusual , touching , naked and new life @-@ feeling in me is wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am .
I am an author . I think things out , I aw@@ ake you to life .
that is part of the job , which means living his dream .
that is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am Neuro@@ surgical .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trag@@ e@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I was a functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor trying to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions .
surely they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep @-@ skin stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one im@@ plant an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neurolog@@ ical function improves .
it truly is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease which suffered from severe tre@@ mb@@ ling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
history began 15 years ago .
at that time I was Chief Physi@@ cian and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that in the brain @-@ brain trau@@ ma the brain oscill@@ ates and the skull pressure rises .
to save life , one has to reduce the skull of the skull .
for this , sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the wollen compound , we decided with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyse the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let cells grow from a tissue , it is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
it is necessary to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to th@@ rive .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it was Jean @-@ François .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from the biology class that stem cells are imm@@ ature cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Double@@ c@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our brain @-@ brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fo@@ etus stage , they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why are they staying with us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find it close to brain injuries in higher concentrations .
but this is not so safe .
one thing is clear , however , -- from these cells we got our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François
and then mark them color , in order to be able to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we planted them at the t@@ apping point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we planted these cells in normal brain tissue r@@ hy@@ mes ? and what will happen if we planted the same cells in a damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they had completely disappeared as if they were removed again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we faced an injury and im@@ par@@ ations exactly the same cells and now the cells stayed -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been im@@ planted .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vit@@ ro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a mon@@ key to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
you had to take food p@@ ellets from one tablet .
that made them very good .
when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor motor in the motor@@ ic cor@@ tex .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen to people , they spont@@ ane@@ ously recovered up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic bra@@ in@@ ting mechanisms . they recover at some extent , just like the monkeys .
when we were certain that the mon@@ key had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you can see the monkeys that spont@@ ane@@ ously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from before injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we im@@ planted the cells : the same mon@@ key , two months after mat@@ ur@@ ation .
I can tell you that we were very exciting for us too .
since then we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can fre@@ eze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
but our dream still is to im@@ plant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely do .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the main obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results one has to fill two kilo@@ grams of papers and forms to pass this kind of studies .
BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you look forward to the future , how many years it takes to get into hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities permit us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi @-@ centric study .
you first have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy . democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
we see democracy not as the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as being un@@ changeable .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved without doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy dis@@ appears with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not the austerity programs that were implemented in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my che@@ esy friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economical model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group have failed to believe , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy .
for without democracy our societies are w@@ asted , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies w@@ asted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin @-@ summit Par@@ ado@@ x &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Schul@@ denberg who thro@@ ws his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the denberg ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the weal@@ thy sa@@ vers and corporations , which , however , are too sc@@ ary to invest in it , where it would be productive and could produce income with which one could carry off the denberg and also produce all the things that humanity urg@@ ently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the euro area , 3.4 tril@@ lion US dollars have been invested in all the prosperity producing goods such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tril@@ lion US dollars sounds a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it with the 5.4 tril@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock markets to infl@@ ate and promote the real estate prices .
thus deb@@ ts and un@@ productive capital form the twin towers that are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand that fav@@ ours the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors in which they do not invest . just like O@@ edi@@ pus father , who is fear@@ ful , the prophecy of the or@@ acle could be true that his son would kill him if he grows up ,
invol@@ un@@ tarily causes the circumstances leading to killing him .
this is my shar@@ per with capitalism --
all un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to further develop human talents , and to finance particularly all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial to the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as a form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally concluded too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclusi@@ ons .
the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they were involved in the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they grant them the right to political participation with the same weigh@@ ting in questions of state concerns .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not lasted for a long time --
like a candle , which g@@ lows very bright , it is also quickly burned out .
however , today &apos;s liberal democr@@ acies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthening the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- so the world of companies -- became a democracy @-@ free zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in today &apos;s democr@@ acies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two takes place , by which the economy gradually under@@ goes the policy and dise@@ m@@ powers them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because today it can be in the government and still not in power , because the power is mig@@ rated from politics to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is roughly like a flock of car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res that are so sustain@@ ably the animals that feed them , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ving at the end .
it is similar to the economy that has chann@@ elled politicians so far that it har@@ ms itself by the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations is increasing , political goods will be de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality rises , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too fri@@ ghtened to invest the cash of their businesses .
the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keep control , just like in ancient Athens , except for the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not particularly good .
the doctrine of the de@@ ac@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : abol@@ ishing the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robot .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , the automation makes the twin summit higher , the waste ex@@ propri@@ ated , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is -- very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to re@@ shape the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and take care that we can democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that makes the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which he has brought forth --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that of &quot; star Trek , &quot; in which machines are similar in which machines serve human beings and people can put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ian &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life .
I believe we must be optim@@ istic .
so what do it burn , how could it look like to have this &quot; Star Trek &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples .
in the business sector : please imagine a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income from capital and revenue origin@@ ates and the concept of wage labor is completely out@@ dated .
no distinction between those who belong to the company , but not working in it , and employees who work there but not belong to the company . no exchange between capital and labour , no big g@@ aps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin peaks .
in the sphere of global political economy : please introduce yourself briefly , that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all of humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is trad@@ ed in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade defic@@ it or the trade surplus of the country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested in the Bret@@ ton Woods conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , in particular against the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time liber@@ t@@ arian , in which it fav@@ ors privileged people , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ n@@ esian , global Key@@ n@@ esi@@ anism .
but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we aw@@ ake in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liberal Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we do this , technological development will generate such a massive drop in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we experience it , it will not only dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ze our democr@@ acies , but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is thoroughly relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am also perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ r , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical statement -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein that said this . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies , we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays , -- the area of the economy -- a totally democratic zone .
in some ways , if I must say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China re@@ sembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly sc@@ ep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what one can observe now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
let China now pret@@ end to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century itself , sm@@ ells huge after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experiences as Greece &apos;s finance ministers at the start of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later for the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say good@@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the ongoing den@@ ial that a massive fl@@ amm@@ ation line passed through the euro@@ zone and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the Euro @-@ Group , have also chosen den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable , to get life through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it may perhaps be delayed for a while , but if the change occurs it is ab@@ rup@@ tly and destruc@@ tive .
BG : what changes do you see before ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everybody who looks back -- Ernst ...
if there is a finance minister or a minister , who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he said he did not make any mistakes , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the proposal to extend the debt programme at the end of February .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders &apos; pages to find a common solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring our government to fall , only because they did not want to deal with the objec@@ ti@@ fication that passed through the euro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Tro@@ ika of the financi@@ ers who imposed this policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ oss@@ al mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if it does not survive , the released cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have disast@@ rous consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be bear@@ able for the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for having been with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price has never heard most , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is managing employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; films , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and content that will produce Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy cannot choose any .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are located at the right side of this curve .
this curve is the application distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website .
if your show is rated with nine and above , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where , after watching a season , your brain asks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where is there any more of these ep@@ iso@@ des ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- that should tell you enough what goes on this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to enter@@ tain &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the medium output , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite .
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time Amazon does something so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight Candi@@ dates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where everyone can watch them free of charge .
and if Amazon goes out for nothing , you take up too , right ?
millions of spectators see these ep@@ iso@@ des .
however they do not know they are observed when watching those shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show when you pause , which parts one ski@@ ps or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data then what show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lands with 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this one super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of hosting a contest , he and his team watched the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , i.e. the reviews they give the shows , their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all together , they went a car and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic states somehow that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision that one meets , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized through very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , or ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we draw more and more to statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the US and asks for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dism@@ iss@@ al is carried out or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always generating the best results . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
the data of sealed companies are also wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that , through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way they can predi@@ ct -- through data analysis of Google research .
it worked wonderful and was a great news sensation . success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked perfectly , year around year , until it suddenly stopped functioning ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all these errors data , data streams into decisions of life -- at work , in enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , put this problem into its parts , so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , put the items back together to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a resolution .
there is another tool for this and we all own it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to put together again , even if the information is incomplete to then get a good decision -- especially if it &apos;s the brain of an expert .
therefore , I believe , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful , because they have used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , what they wouldn &apos;t have been able to do , but the decision on how to take all these parts , put together a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant they entered a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they competing for TV ideas , when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget it , this device is quite useful .
many of you are ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a j@@ a- or no @-@ matter you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- right here at that moment .
I will later contest it with a technical demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , where I should have listened to the ball in hin@@ d@@ sight .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball becomes smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this as very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing and risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
