<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA has illegally heard telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation, in which the CIA had literally drafted drafts for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not work at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has determined against Risen and called upon him to name his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and to spill up journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First constitutional review, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right when media does not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave that they are revealing.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government arrived at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen was living with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they said for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped on the rise.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and getting rid of Risen, this could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, his telephones are secretly worried,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and banking information, his credit card, and even travel tips with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA Whistleblower and Rising.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers in his attempt to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary condemned him more than all US governments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has too much of their work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional review because the government has more and more possibilities to spy out all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology is allowed to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can use technologies to better protect its sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do it from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that has not yet been known as Risen's book written, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transmission system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the Internet of Aaron Swartz, and is now further developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post Office.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just like in any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the relevant news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that threaten us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technologies like Edward Snowden have a possibility to report misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about grievances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report about overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental colleague, the alarm goes for contaminated water from Flint. or a wall street insiders who warned us ahead of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[what does that mean?] [we baten Robert Palmer from Global Witness to have a statement.] [what does that mean?] [we baten Robert Palmer from Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were sent from news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to firms like Fonseca and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad has offices in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous for the next release, and the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent rillers or a John Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and do not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by a few of them to hide and conceal their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these buildings.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for criminal prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably, because there were so far no prominent Americans who arrived in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle, after which these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data dock of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information, need less information to establish a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to take off schoolchildren.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to zoom especially susceptible to investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister, who wanted to bring the suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked it, that all except one of our investigators made suggestions on how to transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top politician, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to complicate this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">That may sound very drowning as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed, as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see that some things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "in the past few years we have seen more transparency concerning the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU acquires central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US lags behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have submitted a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this type of intransparency through laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally end the intransparency which enables this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story I almost escaped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip throughout the country. afterwards he would go to peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he said he would go to a peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Ah, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared on the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what did I get into my mind?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he is mad?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I stepped out of bed, sitting on toe tips to the door, and my bedroom door shut down.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The art work he had bought from me is now hanging in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my point of view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold as a stranger to me in childhood, actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a time leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to turn fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I think how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on hardwood floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese-ham Omelette tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I starved.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay for our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to the roll.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">Thus we presented to the investors: "we want to create a website that people post public images from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors one closes when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "this will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they are not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody, who is still at Trost, would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When one has a problem, one contemplates on the things that one can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Art, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we aspire.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30 seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked cellular phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet flight of panic you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that's more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read their SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked cell of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell us that he is channeling the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail at this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor would first have imagined with his name; if he had told whence he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 convictions, all say: "he can really capture very well-locked hands!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you'd have to leave your mobile?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system reinforces confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to leave negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their judgements before we presented them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we found something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are about age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust people most who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting to add a person's call -- in our case by judgments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three appraisals, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation develops similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted predilections.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much one is revealing.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "tell too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is rather not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "" "Tolle works of art in your apartment! I make holidays with my family holiday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help us overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who unallowed parties to celebrate or devastate apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stay in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front, when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people are rightly bound to each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence works, wonderful things can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even jumped blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgement:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect home for travelers who tend to tend to heart attacks due to sedentary activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save life even though they don't know them properly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay even longer without calculating extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay will expire.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled on this concept for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing work together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is now just" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not fair." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When travelling today, it is possible to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic for this.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place that one visits, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show a quarter of which one has never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would create apartments of reason for sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thought of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul this project has already begun. many parking places owned by the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were deprived of them. incubator programs were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in Share Economy. overnight 785 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host today.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems not to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality has existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this astonishing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda runs past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for the future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it is great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern-Fitness-Fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I decided to outen.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear my hat.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, compared to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and inaccessible beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, questioned and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythmik sometimes brings me to weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone you perceive you fully understands, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the "Egyptian American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"" "I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" "" "breaking News" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, aircraft flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">""... "I changed the TV channel and heard:" ""... Muslim terrorists "" "..."... "" "... in the name of Islam..." ""... "..." "" "jihad..." ""... "" ""</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu the acts of others turned me from a citizen into a suspect.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move into a new city and start postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as we drove in silence -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time fearing to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We went to our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations, said:" "" "be vigilant," "" "Be careful," "" "Stay in well lit areas," "" "Don't melt yourselves." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings were loud:" "" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims, or from people whom they thought for Muslims to go outside and beat.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought, we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">"" "" "" "I have defeated the anger of the people on the terrorists." ""</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to have to explain itself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"" "today, we can actually hear people say:" "" "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims." ""</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They talk about my church like a tumor in the US body.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour can be seen only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, not a tumor in the United States, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, educators and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">It might hold a few parking spaces, but don't stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit to a mosque leads to more tolerance to people of other faiths and to show greater citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalisation process, one has found that it starts online. as a first, the person is cut off from their community, even by their family, so that the extremes group can make a brain washing which causes the person to be the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology is a traitor or belief.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop the people going to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS grounds its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a person, I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination if they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups claim their ideology on their" "" "Holy Book" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if one throws a look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" "" "Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she had spoken brought them to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that had given her anger, she was a main goal for the instrumentalization through extremists who promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam established the connection with God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept it from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affects our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: when one puts news reports in which negative about Muslims were reported, they agreed rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look, when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up of the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to caveat the foundation of a free society that has rational and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear cures us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective debts, it is not just about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was talented, talented, much promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her curriculum vitae. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when did I become such a young man of my brother?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had come to visit in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as in a execution, after having posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot at Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism cannot only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can practise our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the chair of the child, we drove silence, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and went out my shoes, and went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the gathering were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had taken courage and compassion and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who might claim that you hold a TEDTalk, a thinker with draught, work in a sensitive think tank, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't deceive you. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look at the Muslims around the world, and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims all over the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">When humans appear as a rule, then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a milliard business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air parcels entered into our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRAC Centre in France built a six-metre tall tower of 1,500 bricks. some years ago they started flying with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting, flying units reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-resilient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulences and in general react to laws of nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to transcend the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to make a system autonomous, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at the highest level, for example," "" "Start" "" "and" "" "landing" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called tail-starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">An aircraft that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters, it can float, and thus has great advantages with start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of tailgates is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn't matter in what position the optimum position can be recovered and the power can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Originaltitel: desperate Housewives (TV)</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often face basic abstract questions that come to the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that gather together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a tail-ruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flies with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and crossbars, no other actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move around in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the sophisticated algorithm of the tailgate. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of throwing it right when I all watch is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the monospinner is an exercise in sufficiency, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">By doing so, he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in the room in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers from the eight Propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some are available in models, the rest is learned directly from flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see it.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When one builds them together, they behave like a high-performance system.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller is eliminated, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further even if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making halfway airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercially available micro-Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine out there would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the reward lies in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economical potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago circled two black holes to each other in a very far distant galaxy, so the mass of three stars transformed into pure energy in a ten-second second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this brief moment they lit more brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the Universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time frame itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, a multi-cell life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God stands for -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group decided to build a particularly braver -- Rai White of MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them behaved crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector ligo: the laser interferometer- gravitational-wave observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of ligo was considerably increased, which greatly improved the recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final trial to clarify some minor, stubborn issues.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the detecting of the detector, the gravitational-waves rowed through the earth through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell of my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, that was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on MIT. he has been studying gravitation waves from black holes for 23 years and their observatories such as ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a rippling in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and put into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, lecturers in courses lead to relativity-theory often a really alberized dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "stretch and dust, stretch and dust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and punished by us at the meeting of the waves. the elongation of an average person was 10 high.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. therefore, one explained the ligo-employee for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured exactly at less than a thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Kip Thorne, a co-founder, Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties during construction of such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">THORNE published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott claims that Ligo is more than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite convenient, because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming out of several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 metres.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now, just Alice" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "dummer Bob" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot create simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the All literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity to listen, can reveal to us a lot about the collision of two black holes, whereby my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circles simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">The two bodies rotate very quickly, you hear the same circlement with an additional key change. this sounds like the wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard the following: [Surrender] somebody who knows what to hear, recognize this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold sun-mass, which rotate approximately as fast as the stacks of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us briefly consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve one hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves an entirely new way to investigate the universe, as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space can we not see -- practical or basically -- not visible.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in Supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see as this is opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Urbang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the old, but we will never see it, since the urine is covered by its own nightlight.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly, I am optimistic that there exist in all things we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things we just discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt we hadn't expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this topic: me: the species of stars that produce black holes, like Ligo they are watching, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the dinosaur bones for our archaeological work, so to speak.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different perspective on what happened in the universe, the genesis of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circus of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Urball itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us?</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say to everything" "" "Yes!" "" "I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, I feared, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes," "" "has changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes," "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes, which changed my life deeply, to an unexpected sort. it began with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls all" "" "kittens" "", "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kittens, I need milk for my beak cup." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to life in my family. from then on, I always swear to play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I am doing, or where to go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very trying.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magic effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a startling side effect: just recently I fully understood that the "Yes" sagas for playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am an author. I think things out, awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">Ich kreire Fernsehen. ich produciere Fernsehen.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each programme offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days with four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars TV, four television programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts that are simultaneously in production four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series run after each other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are shows which I have created myself, and not only produced, so still obendlessly. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think if the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so that all of you who work so hard whether you're a company, a country or a classroom, take a business or a budget, take me seriously when I talk about work so you can understand that I'm not just about the computer and fantasies, and it's true when I say: I don't understand that it's not a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as I set troops on, as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">Just as if you were dreaming of a high tone, ran a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best part is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz hears like a busy street, I could go for ever on it.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume when I declare to them the sums, that I'm talking about writing that writing makes me pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does them.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sum -- when I started working and working with television as I began to work and work, create, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The Summen is action and activity. the Summen is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sum is music. the sum is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sum is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz then you can no longer strive for size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling not to be different than striving for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is the ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sum.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a titanium, and I know that I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to make a clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more spreadings, the more work there is, the more work, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this summing. I love the sum.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overstressed, exaggerated, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom is a single stitch.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says," "" "Bib, I want to go to Shonda land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums were heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sum of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sum did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My summing was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as usual: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a Titan does not sleep, does not give up, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sustenance.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a Pre-Show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I simply had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the sum I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love suddenly fades?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think," "" "Today, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do it, you're working to be a teacher, a banker to be a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives one the summons when you know the sums, and know how the buzz feels when the sum stops, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart ceases, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no more than two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me "cookies."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she doesn't call anyone anymore" "" "kittens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I hate it when I'm Titan and bolt my buzz, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the absence of the summing, I cannot do anything except to unfit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country, which I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and damp kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it's going to release, or whatever the girl gets into "Die Eiskönigin."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something inside me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums are slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I knew a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us remain with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working environment, the titanium summen, this is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself with the aid of broadcasts and televisions and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is no force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sum is the current that comes from lust.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">Real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be imposed, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the false words to me, for what God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can rid myself of any guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice unless I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not lying to me as you work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">"" "" "" "I am better at work than at home." ""</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession is painful, because what a person is better to work than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We shave around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">In doing so, I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is OK.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fulfilled me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I wonder: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me for naïve, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">There you probably have quite, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you also know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet Show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my teeny daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more does not require it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can get 15 minutes a bit, even at a bad mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No cellphone, no clothes, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to do.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my wellbeing, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the sums of having a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to play" "" "Play" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I will see. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to surpass myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a bit, why not treat yourself at full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sum seems to return if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz, the sum is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The summons of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sum of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The summons of work is part of me, but just one part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is my breath that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, who plays a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country, which I create, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the projection screens, the sum, the buzz, the buzz, the other, the right sum: the totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this summing, the more this unusual, touching, naked and new life-feeling in me is wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this sum, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am an author. I think things out, I awake you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That is part of the job, which means living his dream.</seg>

<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was a functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor trying to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">Surely they have heard of one of the most well-known, the "deep-skin stimulation." in doing so, one implant an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons in such a way that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It truly is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease which suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was Chief Physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that in the brain-brain trauma the brain oscillates and the skull pressure rises.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, one has to reduce the skull of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this, sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the wollen compound, we decided with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyse the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow from a tissue, it is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">It is necessary to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it was Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biology class that stem cells are immature cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our brain-brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the foetus stage, they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they staying with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find it close to brain injuries in higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however, -- from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them color, in order to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we planted them at the tapping point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we planted these cells in normal brain tissue rhymes? and what will happen if we planted the same cells in a damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we planted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they had completely disappeared as if they were removed again, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we faced an injury and imparations exactly the same cells and now the cells stayed -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take food pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">That made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we injured the motor motor in the motoric cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralysed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brainting mechanisms. they recover at some extent, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you can see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after maturation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that we were very exciting for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since then we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely do.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the main obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results one has to fill two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you look forward to the future, how many years it takes to get into hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities permit us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You first have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy. democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see democracy not as the fragile plant that is in reality but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as being unchangeable.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved without doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy disappears with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not the austerity programs that were implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my cheesy friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economical model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup have failed to believe, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are wasted, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin-summit Paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Schuldenberg who throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the denberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, which, however, are too scary to invest in it, where it would be productive and could produce income with which one could carry off the denberg and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the euro area, 3.4 trillion US dollars have been invested in all the prosperity producing goods such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sounds a lot of money, until one compares it with the 5.4 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock markets to inflate and promote the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin towers that are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand that favours the pessimism of investors in which they do not invest. just like Oedipus father, who is fearful, the prophecy of the oracle could be true that his son would kill him if he grows up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily causes the circumstances leading to killing him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my sharper with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">All unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to further develop human talents, and to finance particularly all the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial to the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as a form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally concluded too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of Athenian democracy due to these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the Athenian democracy was and is that they were involved in the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they grant them the right to political participation with the same weighting in questions of state concerns.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not lasted for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which glows very bright, it is also quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, today's liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthening the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- so the world of companies -- became a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">"" "" "" "in today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two takes place, by which the economy gradually undergoes the policy and disempowers them." ""</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today it can be in the government and still not in power, because the power is migrated from politics to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is roughly like a flock of carnivores that are so sustainably the animals that feed them, decimated that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that has channelled politicians so far that it harms itself by the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations is increasing, political goods will be devalued, the inequality rises, the macroeconomic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their businesses.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism distributes the "demos" from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keep control, just like in ancient Athens, except for the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not particularly good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the deacel of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: abolishing the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, the automation makes the twin summit higher, the waste expropriated, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is -- very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "we need to reshape the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and take care that we can democratize the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a pathological monitoring hyperautocracy that makes the film" "" "matrix" "" "like a documentary." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which he has brought forth --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that of "star Trek," in which machines are similar in which machines serve human beings and people can put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian "Agora," in long discussions the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what do it burn, how could it look like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia rather than the "matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the business sector: please imagine a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and revenue originates and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company, but not working in it, and employees who work there but not belong to the company. no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no uplifting twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the sphere of global political economy: please introduce yourself briefly, that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes suggested in the Bretton Woods conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, in particular against the background of a reunified politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time libertarian, in which it favors privileged people, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesianism.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awake in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as liberal Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... do we do this, technological development will generate such a massive drop in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers describes as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we experience it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is thoroughly relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that is why I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not wirr, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical statement -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said this. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you have said very clearly what you think of the West's view to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most plays, -- the area of the economy -- a totally democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some ways, if I must say this provocative, China resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can observe now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">Let China now pretend to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century itself, smells huge after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as Greece's finance ministers at the start of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I thought that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later for the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely to say goodbye to the complacency and the ongoing denial that a massive flammation line passed through the eurozone and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first suggestion that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone, within the Euro-Group, have also chosen denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to get an economic system that is not viable, to get life through political will and authoritarianism, it may perhaps be delayed for a while, but if the change occurs it is abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see before?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everybody who looks back -- Ernst...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister or a minister, who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he said he did not make any mistakes, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the proposal to extend the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">"" "" "" "I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders' pages to find a common solution." ""</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government to fall, only because they did not want to deal with the objectification that passed through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit they had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "it is worse than during the" "" "Great Depression." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the Troika of the financiers who imposed this policy," "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive Tons of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if it does not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have disastrous consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post-modern 1930, after which it appears to me, it will also be bearable for the future of Europeans and non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you're wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for having been with TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Roy Price has never heard most, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is managing employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfrisur and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "films, TV, technique, tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and content that will produce Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy cannot choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are located at the right side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the application distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and above, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" "" "Breaking Bad" "", "" "" "Game of Thrones," "" "The Wire" "", "" "" "The Wire" "", "where, after watching a season, your brain asks," "" "Where is there any more of these episodes?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left side, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- that should tell you enough what goes on this end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price doesn't worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to entertain "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the medium output, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time Amazon does something so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight Candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where everyone can watch them free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon goes out for nothing, you take up too, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators see these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However they do not know they are observed when watching those shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you pause, which parts one skips or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data then what show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four Republican U.S. senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lands with 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this one super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of hosting a contest, he and his team watched the existing data on the Netflix audience, i.e. the reviews they give the shows, their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all together, they went a car and decided not to make a Sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic states somehow that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision that one meets, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized through very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is a bit scary because we live in a time when we draw more and more to statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the US and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dismissal is carried out or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be real bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always generating the best results. this is not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of sealed companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that, through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the bad way they can predict -- through data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news sensation. success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked perfectly, year around year, until it suddenly stopped functioning,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these errors data, data streams into decisions of life -- at work, in enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, put this problem into its parts, so that you can analyze the items; as a second, put the items back together to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all own it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to put together again, even if the information is incomplete to then get a good decision -- especially if it's the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I believe, Netflix was so successful, because they have used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, what they wouldn't have been able to do, but the decision on how to take all these parts, put together a show like "House of Cards," that was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant they entered a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they competing for TV ideas, when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "we say the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget it, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you are...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no-matter you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- right here at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will later contest it with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, where I should have listened to the ball in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball becomes smarter and smarter and smarter. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you are doing and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
